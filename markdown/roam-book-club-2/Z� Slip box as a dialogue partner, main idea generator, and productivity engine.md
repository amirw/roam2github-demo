    - "The depository of notes is where you create, build and shape your thoughts/arguments"
        - Opinions/thoughts you have are registered in slip box in a attempt to actually move forward with it
        - There is a momentum in your pursuit that just adds continually to the depository of your notes --> can translate into manuscript easily if done right
    - "By keeping notes in one place allows thought to be stored in a way that you can always run into it"
        - When you are working on a project you naturally do research for that project. Oftentimes you are looking for an answer. When you do the reading there will naturally be insights which might not fit into your current paper but is interesting, related to another thought or an addition that you might not need in this specific context. 
            - It is a waste if you dont take down these notes as well because
                - This is still knowledge that can be used in another context
                - The project you are working on should not be treated as an isolated event but an exercise in expanding thought 
                - Generally enriches the web of thought of your slip-box
