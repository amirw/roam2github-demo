- #Chat [[Beau Haan 📌]] I just realized that when I am making a new `Zettel` the power is that I am looking for where this new, evidence-based thought, that has been abstracted multiple times, and written in my own words--is to live in the discussion that is already taking place in my [[Zettelkasten]]
    - So even before I complete the ordering of words to state clearly what I have synthesized, I am adding this declarative statement in response to what is nested above
    - This is fascinating, because then a clear thematic connection is created and this dialogue becomes integrated to what I have already written
        - ELI5:: I talk to--what I've already talked about, and the power of that is seen best when I create the `Relevant Notes` that can connect the multiple things I've already talked about~
    - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] yes - exactly!  the dialogue exists in our zettels. After crafting 7 more zettels last night, I woke up thinking about “what is **not** being discussed in my slipbox?” and came up with at least 10 lines of thought that haven’t been explored (or debated!) (((C03U03-FZ))). It is **these** conversations that guide the development of future zettels and how we interpret our `Literature Notes`
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] It goes even deeper than that... The dialogue that presents itself to us over time, influences even the `Fleeting Notes` that we capture, and having the distinct phases allows those ideas to ruminate over time and prevents this need to have a perfect, maximally perfect note--which is what often leads to immobility 
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] Ah - very good point 👍  Yes - it will absolutely influence our fleeting notes (which in turn influence our literature notes)
            - While I realize it’s good not to get stuck, I do feel the stronger relationship you have to your slipbox and the dialogue your Zettels represent, your ability to write zettels right off the bat goes up
        - it will be really neat to get straight what discussions are not yet present or things we feel as a group are unclear and drive what book will address our unanswered questions (Soren might play an important role in this!).  Then we take our slipbox forward to our new book and develop new lines of thought together [[Collective Zetteling]]
            - this will be a bit of an art as we all are focused on our respective individual slipboxes on this iteration.  it will be neat when we can all look into our [[collective slipbox]] and develop new zettels from there.
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] Why can't it be an actual `Collective Zettelkasten`? Check out the #Zettels → page where a conversation is already starting~ 😳
            - newcomers will need to establish a relationship to our [[collective slipbox]] and present questions they feel are not answered from their unique frame of thinking. what will be great about this is a newcomer will be present to an immediate contribution to the group (directing our thinking)
