- Fleeting Notes:: 
    - ## Session 1
        - #[[Questions for SÃ¶nke]] What is your view on keeping direct quotes with notes in your own works? Do you find it useful, or is sticking to Luhmann's system (own words only) enough?
    - "The reason is that by connecting permanent notes, we are "prewriting." The threshold for writing a text has been lowered when entire sections of it have been laid out in advance."
        - Linking (permanent) notes is a way to prewrite.
    - I like this system for [[Multiplayer Roam]]:
        - "[[~Tony Tong]] [[@Tony Tong]]"
            - "this is basically the read tag "I thought about having a "read" tag and filter out those in the query but the problem became what if people reply under that "read" block?""
                - "so same question applies here"
                    - "I guess a [[rule of thumb]] is to always @ someone if you want them to read and not reply in the ~ block "
