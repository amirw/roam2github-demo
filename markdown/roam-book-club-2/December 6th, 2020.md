- # [[Live Session 6]] Starting 12:00 PST
    - #Chat [[Henry Finkelstein]] Is there a recording of the session today posted somewhere? I see a lot of awesome comments in [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]'s post below (thanks Matt!!) and would love to see the second half of the session that I missed :D
        - #Reply-from [[Matt McKinlay]] Hey Henry, thanks for coming in, and thanks for the great ideas too. Video being edited, will be released in the next few days, both in the graph, as well as in the summary email going out later in the week. Look out for it in the graph under the #Video   tag
            - #Reply-from [[Henry Finkelstein]] Thanks Matt!
    - Today's live session had lots of interesting references come up in the chat text window during the Zoom. I caught a copy of that chat shortly before the meeting ended. Most of the subsequent comments consisted of thanks and goodbyes, so if you want to peruse the topics that came up in the chat window, find it nested below:

                - My daily notes still aren‚Äôt loading. I was using the screen share which is down now. Can someone tell me what the writing prompts are that came after ‚Äúwhat about your note taking has changed?"

                - Welcome Sonke!
            - From Henry Finkelstein to Everyone: (12:31 PM)
                - Sonke - you are a patron saint in my intellectual pantheon. Thank you for the gifts of the seeds you‚Äôve planted in my garden
            - From Forrest Perry to Everyone: (12:31 PM)
                - Rocket fuel is pretty expensive. Fortunately, Roam isn‚Äôt as expensive as rocket fuel.
            - From Henry Finkelstein to Everyone: (12:31 PM)
                - +1
            - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (12:32 PM)
                - 1. What have you learnt about note taking that I (S√∂nke) should know about?
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:33 PM)
                - Great question Bill Petro thanks for asking that
            - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (12:34 PM)
                - Get it!
            - From Kate Foy to Everyone: (12:34 PM)
                - Yes. I‚Äôve been pondering that one ‚Ä¶
            - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (12:34 PM)
                - ‚ÄúNo need for structure, but a structure is available if you need it there"
            - From Jeremie Rykner to Everyone: (12:35 PM)
                - Question:Is there an optimal size for an effective  #Zettelkasten ? Beyond that will give you diminishing returns?
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:35 PM)
                - ‚ÄúNo need to go through all the steps if you just KNOW what stage it is supposed to be"
            - From dan allosso to Everyone: (12:36 PM)
                - Luhmann‚Äôs second version (1973-96) was about 67,000 notes.
            - From Kate Foy to Everyone: (12:37 PM)
                - The case for spaced repetition in reading a book/article to allow the ideas to emerge?
            - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (12:37 PM)
                - 1st Slipbox Luhmann had 108 Top-level parent topics
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:37 PM)
                - ‚ÄúBeginners often make too many notes‚Äù too true yes I can vouch for that from hard experience
            - From Thomas to Everyone: (12:38 PM)
                - QUESTION: Now that you‚Äôre a Roam user with no pen in hand, how has Roam changed your work (process and content) as well as your sense of the possibilities for note taking?
            - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (12:38 PM)
                - 2nd Slipbox Luhmann had 11 Top-level parent topics
            - From dan allosso to Everyone: (12:38 PM)
                - @Kate how much are we reading and keeping notes for big ideas like that, vs. how frequently are we reading for facts.
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:38 PM)
                - I saw your question Thomas and I second it, let‚Äôs keep that question on the list for Soenke
            - From Kate Foy to Everyone: (12:39 PM)
                - @Dan I‚Äôm reading and taking notes on a book I‚Äôve read several times. The big idea is just now starting to become clear.
            - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (12:39 PM)
                - Purpose!!! Love that
            - From CatherineRickwood to Everyone: (12:40 PM)
                - Third vote for Thomas‚Äô question.
            - From Forrest Perry to Everyone: (12:40 PM)
                - Maps of content = Nick Milo (he has a course on Obsidian)
            - From dan allosso to Everyone: (12:40 PM)
                - @Kate, I agree. And I think there‚Äôs evidence Luhmann DID in fact return to books and articles and read them agin, looking for different ideas (Schmidt 2016).
            - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (12:41 PM)
                - QUESTION: Now that you‚Äôre a Roam user with no pen in hand, how has Roam changed your work (process and content) as well as your sense of the possibilities for note taking?
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:41 PM)
                - Thanks Forrest, that looks interesting
            - From Kate Foy to Everyone: (12:41 PM)
                - @Dan - can‚Äôt believe we wouldn‚Äôt return to the source material for verification. ‚ÄúThe devil in the detail‚Äù :)
            - From CK Lin to Everyone: (12:42 PM)
                - How much effort/time/energy do you put in to provide metadata as you read things?
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:42 PM)
                - This is the concept Forrest was referring to:
                    - [In what ways can we form useful relationships between notes? | by Nick Milo | Medium](https://medium.com/@nickmilo22/in-what-ways-can-we-form-useful-relationships-between-notes-9b9ec46973c6)
                    - [[Nick Milo]]
            - From dan allosso to Everyone: (12:43 PM)
                - Luhmann also said he spent more time tending the Zettelkasten than he did writing, so it does sound like he returned to notes and ‚Äúsurfed‚Äù the box.
            - From Bill Petro to Everyone: (12:43 PM)
                - Thanks @Matt
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:43 PM)
                - ‚ÄúZettelsurfing‚Äù üèÑ üèÑ üèÑ

                - To get back into the Context!!!
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:45 PM)
                - ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to see the struggles other people are having‚Äù too true
            - From Jason Griffing to Everyone: (12:45 PM)
                - totally
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:46 PM)
                - Noting this: that Soenke is saying that if he were to present it again he‚Äôd allow for more ‚Äúbalance‚Äù between top-down and bottom-up; the temptation is to really focus on the bottom up because the usual bias is to understate it, but there‚Äôs value in both directions
            - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (12:46 PM)
                - Yes! More kind to oneself!
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:47 PM)
                - +1
            - From Jason Griffing to Everyone: (12:47 PM)
                - This is so refreshing to hear. The balance idea between bottom-up and top-down has been the single biggest struggle for me.
            - From Kate Foy to Everyone: (12:47 PM)
                - Love this ‚Ä¶ making a beautiful mess is my learning mantra.
            - From jason kleinberg to Everyone: (12:47 PM)
                - That‚Äôs helpful Sonke. Kindness üôè
            - From dan allosso to Everyone: (12:47 PM)
                - Yeah, I think the issue might be more USEFUL rather than CORRECT practices, and these can change over time.

                - .
            - From Gleb Reys to Everyone: (12:48 PM)
                - QUESTION: if you have new information or alter original idea captured in a permanent note - do you go back to that note and rewrite it, or do you create new note and link to it from the original idea? Want to understand if Zettelkasten is  meant to be ‚Äúmy most refined and final opinion on each topic‚Äù or a ‚Äúcollection of ideas, including how my understanding evolved‚Äù
            - From Jason Carman to Everyone: (12:49 PM)
                - I second that concern/question from. I‚Äôve wondered about the difference and implication between the written slip-box and the roam slip-box.
            - From Kate Foy to Everyone: (12:50 PM)
                - ‚ÄúFinding a reasonable logic‚Äù in Roam - yes, @Matt
            - From Jason Griffing to Everyone: (12:50 PM)
                - Totally agree with the emphasis on block structure, indentation, etc.
            - From Julie Freyberg to Everyone: (12:50 PM)
                - Great Question, Sonke‚Ä¶
            - From Kate Foy to Everyone: (12:51 PM)
                - Great project @Henry
            - From dan allosso to Everyone: (12:51 PM)
                - Had a conversation this week with Mark Robertson about how much stuff goes into Roam. He puts a LOT in and I was thinking of just using it as a literature and permanent note store.
            - From Joel Chan to Everyone: (12:51 PM)
                - great point, Matt! another way to think about links: bc Roam's structure is isomorphic to the brain in terms of its associative structure, we can also have some kind of confidence that notes that get "lost" will tend to be less important (bc they are less connected), yet there are still routes back to them if they are linked to at least one other thing: if those ideas become important again, those notes will resurface through the links, similar to human memory.
            - From dan allosso to Everyone: (12:51 PM)
                - This would seem to impact the number of tags, ability to backtrace, etc.
            - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (12:51 PM)
                - Being intentional about my tagging conventions was my biggest ‚Äî what are the rules I follow? (Lowercase vs uppercase, concepts vs collections)
            - From Nikki Huang to Everyone: (12:52 PM)
                - Really looking forward to seeing your iterations and thought processes Henry!
            - From CK Lin to Everyone: (12:52 PM)
                - Is there an optimal number of talking partners you‚Äôve found?
            - From William Njau to Everyone: (12:52 PM)
                - My answer to Sonke: Date everything to the future so that it can surface later
            - From Nikki Huang to Everyone: (12:52 PM)
                - Yes, or multiple examples, because as Henry says, we don‚Äôt want to be too directive
            - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (12:53 PM)
                - yes! important to see examples of actual implementations
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:53 PM)
                - I agree William, I think postdating things to automatically surface them later is a great strategy
            - From StephanC to Everyone: (12:53 PM)
                - As a beginner, seeing examples indeed helps a lot in finding a way to develop my own
            - From Jason Carman to Everyone: (12:53 PM)
                - Having a an example zettelkasten would be very helpful
            - From Jason Griffing to Everyone: (12:53 PM)
                - Seeing examples with a corresponding set of explanations as to why certain ‚Äúdesign decisions‚Äù were made would be an optimal balance.
            - From Gleb Reys to Everyone: (12:53 PM)
                - Not just Zettelkasten specific, think it‚Äôs about time Roam started a section with templates - examples of how task management, literature notes, to-do lists or reading lists are done for optimal inter-connectedness.
            - From Nikki Huang to Everyone: (12:54 PM)
                - That‚Äôs a great idea Gleb!
            - From Jason Griffing to Everyone: (12:54 PM)
                - That would help people understand the principles
            - From CatherineRickwood to Everyone: (12:54 PM)
                - Agree Henry. I‚Äôve spent hours on YouTube, reading and experimenting with a couple of  articles so that I can understand the process before diving in too quickly.
            - From Henry Finkelstein to Everyone: (12:54 PM)
                - +1 Jason
            - From Henry Finkelstein to Everyone: (12:54 PM)
                - Love the idea of principles vs. prescriptions
            - From Forrest Perry to Everyone: (12:54 PM)
                - Just never use tags. Problem solved.
            - From Jason Griffing to Everyone: (12:55 PM)
                - üòÇ
            - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (12:55 PM)
                - +1 on seeing examples and variations. To match concepts and guidelines with how the structure of the zettelkasten might materialize.
            - From StephanC to Everyone: (12:55 PM)
                - I also find it insightful to see examples of what didn't work for someone, why and how it was improved
            - From Nikki Huang to Everyone: (12:55 PM)
                - @Catherine, did you find any particularly helpful resources?
            - From Me to Everyone: (12:55 PM)
                - But tags are so useful when you need them! The trick is to realize that most of the time you don‚Äôt need them so don‚Äôt stress out over them
            - From dan allosso to Everyone: (12:55 PM)
                - Personally, I think it‚Äôs valuable to have a physical box and cards, and write down the things I think might be permanent notes. Then look at them regularly and ‚Äútend‚Äù the garden. But this is an individual rather than a group practice.
            - From CatherineRickwood to Everyone: (12:55 PM)
                - Interview with Joel Chan by Robert Haisfield.

                - Too much control reduces creativity.  Too much creativity often feels too out of control.  Such a sensitive balance to strike - in Roam, work, life...

                - Matt B, how do you know when you need/want tags?  What is yr threshold?
            - From Daniel Zimmermann to Everyone: (12:56 PM)
                - the tagging system would be less quite hard to implement if Roam would enable either to merge them  or to network them in something which would make sense

                - Unfortunately I have to run. Thank you so much to S√∂nke and to the whole community here. I hope we can all continue to find creative ways to collaborate once this book club has run its course. üôè

                - Julie that‚Äôs a great question. I think I tag things if I know they are concepts that I think about often. But it‚Äôs totally subjective.

                - @Brandon‚Ä¶ truth!
            - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:16 PM)
                - A question I have: Given the group exploration of zettelkasten in ROAM, what parts of the book were MOST important, and which feel LESS relevant to the digital space.
            - From Me to Everyone: (1:19 PM)
                - I‚Äôm also seeing, Beau, that you‚Äôve block referenced your permanent note in a bunch of places, and then under that permanent note you can bring up all the backlinks at a glance. It‚Äôs a really nice way to let the permanent note function as a kind of ‚Äúcenter‚Äù around which related notes can constellate
            - From dan allosso to Everyone: (1:20 PM)
                - @Beau, that was a very cool demo!
            - From Me to Everyone: (1:20 PM)
                - This system means that the ‚Äúhub‚Äù happens at the block level, not the page level
            - From Me to Everyone: (1:21 PM)
                - That‚Äôs the part that takes many beginners a while to ‚Äúgrok‚Äù because everybody starts out with Wikipedia as the paradigm and this is not Wikipedia

                - Didn‚Äôt get if you‚Äôve written the process/procedure in an article or have explained it in a public video
            - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:28 PM)
                - When I consider a highly collaborative zettelkasten, I‚Äôd like the ability to filter references BY AUTHOR (or other ways)
            - From Nikki Huang to Everyone: (1:28 PM)
                - Question: I still don‚Äôt know how to integrate Beau‚Äôs method (which was focused on building Zettels using one paragraph of the text at a time) with a permanent note that is based on multiple paragraphs. Do you guys have any thoughts on that?
            - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:28 PM)
                - It‚Äôs all filterable @brandon
            - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:28 PM)
                - @joey, the inline block refs are filterable?
            - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:29 PM)

            - From Jeremie Rykner to Everyone: (1:29 PM)
                - #RoamHackatons where we focus on specific questions/problems could be a way to go
            - From Me to Everyone: (1:29 PM)
                - Nikki I think those are two different pathways you can take to get to a permanent note but either path is valid, it‚Äôs just whatever works best in the moment

                - I love the idea of stacking ideas over time ‚Äî challenging and supporting premises. Individually, within small teams, and as larger organizations

            - From Nikki Huang to Everyone: (1:47 PM)
                - Exactly, so how do we integrate that density idea in our own note-taking? That‚Äôs kind of why I was talking about making permanent notes which integrate various parts of the book rather than one paragraph at a time. What do you guys think about having some fleeting / literature notes which don‚Äôt end up becoming their own permanent notes, but instead might be integrated into a single permanent note later on, maybe at the end of reading a chapter or something?
            - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:48 PM)
                - +1 @Nikki
            - From Me to Everyone: (1:49 PM)
                - That‚Äôs a great question Nikki. I think a lot about Christopher Alexander‚Äôs ‚Äúlevels of scale‚Äù here. He proposed multiple tables of contents, each at a different level of bird‚Äôs eye view from way high up to granular
            - From CatherineRickwood to Everyone: (1:49 PM)
                - @Nikki. I‚Äôm wrestling with that myself. Current thinking is to pull fleeting notes across a whole book or chapter together to create permanent notes, or even bringing all the fleeting notes together for literature notes.
            - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:49 PM)
                - Ouuuuuu, Matt! Love that concept.
            - From Me to Everyone: (1:49 PM)
                - It‚Äôs a tall order for ONE person to create such a table of contents for any book but as a team project I think it‚Äôs really fun
            - From Jason Carman to Everyone: (1:49 PM)
                - random question here, what book was read in the first RBC?

            - From Me to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
                - The work of thinking for me often seems to happen right there at the very end - the final ‚Äúproduction‚Äù touches that make the permanent note really feel permanent

        - Pick from the prompts below and write in your own page for 25 minutes.
        - Questions for us from [[S√∂nke Ahrens]]
            1. What have you learnt about note taking that I (S√∂nke) should know about?
            2. Are there any additions to the process described in the book?
            3. Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten?
            4. (what use cases does it work for? Are there any examples it doesn't work for?)
        - General review questions 
            1. Reflect on your impressions of the book 
                - "A wonderful hand-hold on process but, more importantly, a poetics of learning, and an urging to educators to reflect upon their own methodologies."
            2. Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?
                - "Getting used to the terminology was a starting bump along the way - important to get definitions right to clarify thinking - but the individuality that can follow in the (process) footsteps of Luhmann and Ahrens has led to flexibility and discoveries. "Making a beautiful mess" is a mantra of my own learning and advice to my (performing arts) students."
                    - "Staying calm during all of this has been necessary - the rush to create lots of material (to endgame) got in the way; messy can be/was beautiful, and there are learnings, always. "
                    - "The upside has been moving my process along - and increasing a daily discipline of reading then learning how this process - let's call it "Zettling" is now solid. Ahrens approach has provided a template for finding my way. There have been models by others that I have begun integrating into my own approach, and I consider this a work in progress."
            3. Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?  
                - "Absolutely - it's now a habit and part of my daily TODOs."
                    - "Finding a way that worked for me was/is key to all of this but perhaps the biggest learning has been **don't let highlights/notes taken quickly from a source moulder in the graph** but the importance of actively creating fleeting notes and set that up permanent notes and potential articles. That requires **discipline and daily (almost) attention** - tending the digital garden as some others have called it. "
                    - "Spending time on this is a habit that needs forming and this has been a challenge. By putting these as TODO s in my Daily Notes page, I've started to get back into the exercise of reading and writing - the most valuable take-away of Book Club 2 for this book and others I have begun in the interim. **It's now a process and, more importantly, a habit.**"
