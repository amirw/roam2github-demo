- Fleeting Notes:: 
    - **Intro**
        - This thinking blows me away.  Such good think, resonants so much with me.  The huge power of writing, and how intelligence and good thinking rests on writing.  
        - Centrality of organizing your writing.  Still a little fuzzy about that.  Is it the how of it I"m fury about?  But that is what book is about.  
            - Organizing of writing - how diff things you write build on each other.  Building blocks of your writing.  
            - What all is involved in organizing your writing?  
            - I just noticed that, in my mind, talking to myself, using the word "writing" was, is the same as using the word "thinking".  As in formulating the above thought.  Like they were interchangeable.  Wow.  And I just noticed that, in my mind, talking to myself, using the word "writing" was, is the same as using the word "thinking".  As in formulating the above thought.  Like they were interchangeable.  Wow.  And cool.  
            - Taking note is a type of organizing.  Maybe the heart of it.  
            - All of this organizing and note taking is a type of preparation for writing.  Maybe it is THE preparation for writing.  And Sonke is saying that preparation is the key to good writing.  
        - Our understanding/conceptualization of writing and how it works is:
            - inaccurate
            - incomplete
        - Starting points of writing as - what?  
            - sparked by what excites you as you read, 
            - and then, second, and maybe third, forth, fifth - the sparks fly from YOUR thinking, your further thinking, sparked by the original sparks of the author.  YES!
            - So, beginnings, starting points, as "a thing".  A thing that changes in this new format/organization/method/approach/system of smart notes/zettlekasten/or ....
            - It is best (?) to write while you read.  Or on the second pass of reading.  Is this a claim?  What is all this that people keep saying about "claims"?  Sees to have something to do with "truths"  Possible truths.  Cool.  
        - Consequences, effects, results, things that happen because of this new approach:
            - More
                - ease
                - fun
                - learning
                - insight
                - connections, interconnections
                - new ideas
                - efficiency/speed/make progress
                - organization
                - surprises
                - progress in your writing - and thinking
            - Less
                - fear, daunting-ness, dread of the blank page
        - Is some of this (thinking/advice) different for writing poetry?  How, and how not?  He did only include very specific types of writing in saying who this book was for - student, academics, nonfiction writers.  Curious about this.  
        - You can invite and assist yourself to do more of what you want through changing/modifying your environment - rather than using will power
            - He connects to to making/having tasks be:
                - interesting
                - meaningful
                - well-defined
                    - This last one, well-defined, seems to hold more leverage, at least for me.  Because, I think, most of what I spend time on (of course there could be improvement) is already the first two, interesting and meaningful.  But well-defined, could use improvement.  
            - And it would be a good experiment, I think to use these 3 as guideposts, to ask myself, is this - interesting, meaningful and well-defined?

- **Quotes/highlights**
    - **Intro**
        - (p 2)  ... improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference.
        -  ... the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen 
        - ... showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But most of all, you can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward.
        - Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.
        - ... the way we organise the everyday writing, how we take notes of what we encounter and what we do with them, will make all the difference for the moment we do face the blank page/ screen 
        - (Why) note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly.
        - (p 4)  The key to successful writing lies in preparation...  
        - It is not so important who you are but what you do.
    - **1 Everything You Need to Know**
        - “I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.” A good structure allows you to do that, to move seamlessly from one task to another–without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture.
        - A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas.
        - The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward.
        - … it is usually the best students who struggle the most.

- **OTHER>>>**
    - Do I want to be writing all this in MY Roam pages???  (That I am doing here on my Julie F page)  Don't I want to be making/connecting other notes in all this writing?  Like making in-line reference??  I am confused about this - ???
    - NOV 8th Zoom session - writing time
        - Possible questions - Gist of book ?  [[Fleeting Notes]], what are they?  How do you do them?  Use them?  WhAt does it mean to you?
            - Center of the book - The wholesale reconceptualization of both writing and reading, to make possible more powerful thinking and insight, knowing and experiencing of reality and other good things, like truth, aliveness and love.
            - [[Fleeting Notes]]  Your first response to the writing, what it sparks in you, what excites you, what you have questions about, what interests you, and then what else you connect it to.  Raw experience.  
            - And then the other little rivers that it leads you to.  Other ideas you want to ponder.
            - The way I"ve been taking [[Fleeting Notes]] seems cumbersome and unworkable and takes a long time.  There has got to be a better way.  And I"ve been experimenting.  My process has been -
                - read the book (a section), (the physical book ), underline, make a few margin notes
                - Copy/paste out some quotes in Roam
                - Make [[Fleeting Notes]] from those, just writing what it sparks in me.
                - Have not yet taken it to the next step, of more permanent notes.  And only read the first 50 pages thus far.  
                - But I have been enjoying taking the time to attend to what it is sparking within me

- NOV 22  Book Club
    - WRiting...
        - Pick from the prompts below and write in your own page for 15 minutes.
            - Reflect on the book.  What are you impressions? 
            - Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way? 
            - Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? 
            - How is your progress towards your initial goals? Or have they changed?
            - Explore the concept of permanent notes/zettels.
                - Explain what a permanent note is in your own words?
                - What is holding you back from creating zettels?
                - What are you unsure about? 
            - Do you have any questions for [[Sönke Ahrens]]?
        - ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^
        - How does it affect my writing, that others will see it?  Hmm.  Am I a little shy to...  And I don't like admitting this - to be really more open about where I"m struggling.  And, I'm struggling a lot.  WIth what?  Well, with having time to do any of this (and many other things in my life).  And with having/taking the time to learn Roam.  I really want to, and - I'm not doing it yet.  ANd then there is all the other things - like taking for my parents, and just getting the diagnosis that my mom has cancer and has several months to live.  LIke, getting that news 3 days ago.  And then dealing with Covid and all taht's involved with that.  Anyway, on to other things.  
        - TImeline - I liked the pace of the first book more, going through it a little slower.  Doesn't have to as slow as that, but this pace, well, hard to keep up.  
        - Progress to my goal...  Well, wait a minute.  What is really important to write and think about now?  What are MY questions?  My goals/intent - to learn Roam (no progress), to learn about using/metabolizing reading and writing more, and doing more writing (a little progress, and excited about more, as I go through the book more - and I did like the thinking/writing that was s parked in me from the book), and then 3rd, friends, connections, community (a little progress, but that feels like a process that requires a lot of time.  So mixed reviews for that.  And maybe I could be doing more with that, being more active).

- Live session 5 - Nov 28
    - "Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month. "
        - Whew.  Past couple times could not write in the sidebar...  
        - So...  Feeling a real mix.  Always good to be here, in the live time group.  And would like to make more connections with folks.  Know that I could and need to be more initiating with that.  Act on it.  Would like to do one of Beau's sessions, I think that could help a lot.  
        - And then - I have just not taken the time to really inhabit and practice with doing the note taking.  Life has been fairly overwhelming, with all the needs of my parents and care for them, moving them, cancer diagnosis, 2 week Feldenkrais training. 
        -  So...  What to write about, think about now?  Just had an idea - what if I took 1 full day and dedicated it to learning Roam?  Do all that online course.  Do a bunch of writing.  Could try that.  And that would further my goal of learning Roam, getting more fluent with it.  
        - Possible Zettle - writing is a primary tool for cultivating insight and thinking.  (And SO many other things...)

                        - WHAt is the autor saying?
                            - Reading, to really get it inside of you, requires being active with the material, meaning running it through your mind and writing.  You have to ENGAGE more of yourself, participate in the process.  
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The role of effort and trying - do less, and the trying you do do, is at the beginning, and then is incorporated into habit.  The internal treasure (insight, thinking, etc) needs an external structure to help it live, thrive, stay alive.
                        - What resonants??  The part about effort being not the key.  Willpowering actually gets in the way.  The "effort" comes at the beginning, and then can get integrated, and become mor
                        - What resonants??  The part about effort being not the key.  Willpowering actually gets in the way.  The "effort" comes at the beginning, and then can get integrated, and become more "natural".  "Thinking within an external memory" - this idea of the importance of external structure to support internal - insight, thinking, processes.
