- ## Questions
    - **Would love to get feedback from people in the book club on these questions.**
    - #Question   How do you handle choosing titles for [[permanent notes]] in Roam?
        - I use a) **terms/concepts** because of the indexing power of Roam and b) **questions** for topics where I haven't reached any conclusions. ^^**But I'm curious how people title other permanent notes in their digital Zettelkasten.**^^
    - #Question   How do you transfer [[fleeting notes]] into Roam when they are not tied to [[reference notes]]?
        - Examples: isolated quotes, ideas from a conversation with someone, Tweets, etc.
        - ^^**Do you just throw it into the Daily Notes Page and tag it there?**^^ I've experimented with using one page for all Twitter links and another page for all quotes (Chrestomathy). Are there any benefits to having them on the daily notes page?

        - Really enjoyed this book. I wish I'd read it 10 years ago.
        - Much of my focus in the last couple months has been on answering this question: ^^**How should the Zettelkasten be adapted and translated to work most effectively as a digital version in Roam?**^^
        - In other words, what needs to be **changed, applied, or removed** to make the digital application **more powerful and less time-consuming**? Here are my thoughts (so far) from reading and experience.
        - [[My Zettelkasten Workflow]] and [[Zettelkasten in Roam]]
            - [[fleeting notes]]: capturing **ideas, quotes, and links** (sources)
                - Don't currently use Roam to capture fleeting notes. Instead, I mainly use **Evernote, Instapaper, Twitter bookmarks, and a simple physical notebook**. I like to keep Roam clean with intentional notes (even on the Daily Notes pages).
                - For me, ^^**fleeting notes are transitional notes**^^ that I capture from conversations, podcasts, etc. Technically, [[Instapaper]] highlights and [[Kindle]] highlights are also fleeting notes, but since they can be copied and pasted directly into [[reference notes]], they're much easier to work with.
            - [[reference notes]]: **bibliographic information **and **highlights/quotes** from source
                - Luhmann's (and Sönke's) version of reference notes needed to be brief, because they were working with a physical system. This concern is not relevant in Roam.
                - I **highlight extensively** while I read and add all of those highlights to the reference notes, which I call [[source notes]].
                - Since **Roam automatically indexes everything, I don't worry too much about being selective.** If I like a quote, I ^^**highlight the entire paragraph**^^. If I feel like there are multiple interesting ideas in a larger section, I don't take the time to isolate each of them in the moment. I just ^^**highlight the entire section.**^^
                - I've also added 4 entire books into Roam:
                    - [[Scriptures]] - Old and New Testaments
                    - The Platonic Tradition - Peter Kreeft
                    - Socratic Logic - Peter Kreeft
                    - Total Truth - Nancy Pearcey
                - On these reference notes, I include the following [[metadata]]:
                    - **Page Link**: [[Source Notes]]
                    - **Title**: Full title and subtitle
                    - **Author**
                    - **Source Type**: e.g. Articles, Books, Interviews, Sermons, Podcasts, etc.
                    - **Topics**: Main topics of the book and sub-topics that are relevant for my research, thinking, or writing (for sub-topics, I try to include the chapter, so I can easily find it later)
                    - **URL**: link Amazon product page
                    - **Outline/Contents**: For books, this is just the table of contents. For other sources, I create my own outline for quick reference.
                    - **Adversaria**: interesting information about the context of the book, not the content (e.g. author, purpose for writing, biographical details, public reception, historical significance, etc.)
                    - **Related Resources**: Study Guides, Discussion Questions, Articles or Lectures about the Book, Author interviews, Reviews, Author's Blog, etc.
                    - **Main Ideas**: the main ideas of the book, summarized in my own words (3-5 bullet points)
                    - **My Review**: brief and personal (1-2 paragraphs); often copied to or from [my Goodreads account](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16571638-luke-miller)
                    - **Highlights & Notes**: all the highlights (quotations) from my reading and all my personal notes (summary, interaction, questions, etc.)
            - [[literature notes]]: stages of **elaboration**, **commentary**, and syntopical **research**
                - Stage 1: **Bolding**, ^^Highlighting^^, and [[Tagging]]
                    - My first pass at literature notes involves **bolding, highlighting, and tagging in all of the quotes** that I added to the Bibliographic Notes. This basically covers the initial steps of [[Progressive Summarization]], a method I learned from [[Tiago Forte]].
                    - **I add tags to flag bullet points for** ^^**how I want to use them later**^^ **or** ^^**how I want to connect them to other ideas**^^. Currently, I use [[Topic Tags]], [[Genre Tags]], and [[Knowledge Type Tags]].
                    - For tags, I use the following format: #[[Example Link]]. This allows me to get the **tag style but still use spaces in the title.** And since Roam treats links and tags the same (both create pages), this keeps everything consistent.
                    - Another important part of this step is **creating links for any key concepts, terms, or proper names**. Since Roam automatically indexes these pages, they are valuable even if I don't add any content to them.
                - Stage 2: Progressive Summarization
                    - I used to create a new page for this step, but after taking [[Lukas Kawerau]]'s [Cite to Write](https://learn.cortexfutura.com/p/cite-to-write) course, I changed my workflow. Now, ^^**I indent these notes directly under the book quotes.**^^
                    - t takes **half the time to process book notes now**, because most of my **notes stay in the original context as a child block under the original quote**.
                    - I just work my way through the original quotes, adding thoughts or ideas, writing down questions that come to mind, and tagging/linking as needed.
                    - Again, instead of pulling these summarizations out of their context, I keep my personal notes nested under the quote. The main benefit here is that when I reference those notes in the future, I can easily scan the original quotes to get context.
                    - **Any time I return to those notes, I can add new summarizations and nest them in another bullet under the original quote**. So over time, it's possible to see how my thinking has developed on those specific ideas.
            - [[permanent notes]]: **terms or concepts**, **open questions** I'm exploring/researching, and **key ideas** in my thinking/writing
                - **A few days later, I return to these literature notes and decide which ideas are important for my thinking, writing, and research**. Those ideas are used to create Permanent Notes. I think [[Andy Matuschak]] calls these [evergreen notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes).
                - **If I see reference notes (original quotes from the source) or literature notes (my own thoughts and commentary) that connect with permanent notes, I** ^^**block reference**^^ **those.**
                - Currently, about **half of my 300+ permanent notes are** ^^**concepts or terms.**^^** These are the pages where linked and unlinked references are especially valuable. Over time, I remix and elaborate on those references and create original content on the note itself.
                - The other **half are** ^^**short propositions**^^. I try to make sure these page titles are memorable, linked to multiple sources, and important for writing projects I'm working on.
                - **I use questions for permanent note titles when I have not reached a conclusion** or am not able to make an assertion that I'm willing to defend.
                - Permanent notes are given the following [[metadata]]:
                    - **Page Link**: [[Permanent Notes]]
                    - **Knowledge, Topic, and Genre Tags**: (see points 7, 8, and 9 below)
                    - **Sources**: links to sources that are key to understanding this topic or relevant for my own research
                    - **Related Notes**: other permanent notes that are tangently related to the topic (these are the links that often create serendipitous connections later); I also link to project notes where I think these ideas might be useful
                    - **My Notes**: my own thoughts or interactions based on my thinking and reading on this topic
                    - **Chrestomathy**: selected quotes to aide in learning or explaining this topic
                    - **Questions**: unanswered or unexplored questions related to this topic; also includes objections to permanent notes that are titled as propositions
                - To help me identify related notes that might not be immediately obvious, I use the [[questions]] that [[Sönke Ahrens]] provides in his book:
                    - How does this fact fit into my idea of …?
                    - How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory?
                    - Are these two ideas contradictory or do they complement each other?
                    - Isn’t this argument similar to that one?
                    - Haven’t I heard this before?
                    - And above all: What does x mean for y?
            - [[structure notes]], or [[index notes]]: **entry points** into my digital Zettelkasten; they also function as **prompts for writing inspiration**
                - This is the new addition to my system. I am still figuring out how to create ^^**useful and intuitive entry points into my notes**^^ using these Structure Notes. These are the **three types that I'm currently using**.
                - Type 1: Topic Overview
                    - This is easy. When I start reading on a new topic, I just **copy the basic outline of topics from Wikipedia** and turn all the headings into pages.
                - Type 2: Based on [[Richard Feynman]]'s [[Favorite Problems]]
                    - These are **lists of connected topics that get me excited about reading, writing, and researching**. I start here when I want easy motivation to write and create.
                - Type 3: Topic and Idea Constellations
                    - This last type of structure note is still a WIP. I want structure **notes that pull together pages that give me a** ^^**constellation of metaphors**^^ **and ideas for creating new content.**
            - [[project notes]]
                - When I wanted to write before, I would normally start here. I'd open a new document and stare at a blank page, hoping for inspiration to strike. **But a** ^^**powerful note-taking system like a digital Zettelkasten**^^ **combined with a** ^^**powerful tool like Roam**^^ **gives me a huge headstart on writing**.
                - As [[Sönke Ahrens]] puts it in his book, this kind of note taking system becomes a ^^**"dialogue partner, main idea generator, and productivity engine"**^^.
                - With a few clicks through my permanent notes, I can locate (and many times rediscover) ideas from my previous reading and research. And here’s the amazing part. Most of the time, these notes already include ideas that I've summarized in my own words.
