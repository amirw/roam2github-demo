- [[Introduction]]
    - good [[writing]] depends on good [[note taking]]
    - [[academic success]] is dependent on [[everyday work]]
        - there is no correlation between [[IQ]] and [[academic success]]
        - [[academic success]] is dependent on the quantity of [[self-discipline]] or [[self-control]] which are components of [[everyday work]]
        - [[everyday work]] also includes doing the work required and doing it in a "smart way"
    - [[will power]] is limited and cannot be achieved with [[self-control]] and [[self-discipline]]
        - others have said that will power does not improve over time but I have had a different experience and therefore, believe that the methods used to improve willpower and defective.
    - [[self-control]] and [[self-discipline]] have more to do with our environment than [[will power]]
        - "every task that is interesting, meaningful, and well-defined will be done" this will beat [[will power]] any time
        - if you want to succeed, don't depend on [[will power]], depend on your [[environment]]
    - behavior has more to do with [[environment]] than it does with [[self-control]] and [[self-discipline]].
        - something this author fails to address is the [[environment]] of the [[mind]]
            - the [[mind]] contains an [[environment]] that can be changed
                - the [[mind environment]] includes [[thoughts]] 
                - if [[thoughts]] can be changed than the [[mind environment]] changes and [[behaviors]] and [[actions]] change.
                - this is why I believe that [[will power]] can improve
- [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
    - this book will show you [[note taking]]
        - it will do so by using the son of a brewer's success as an example.
    - it will show you how to integrate [[note taking]] with work flow.
        - this is accomplished with [[good structure]].
            - having [[good structure]] does the bulk work for you so you can focus on content, argument, and ideas. 
                - i.e. when writing: you can break the task down to bite sizes, finish the paper by finishing them. 
                    - if the task is to write a paper but I can't sit and write then focus on taking notes - that is [[good structure]].
                - [[good structure]] is different from a [[plan]]
                    - a [[plan]] makes you [[rigid]] and requires [[will power]]
                        - using [[will power]] will make you tired
                        - if you are [[rigid]] you are not [[creative]]
                        - [[planning]] also prevents [[insight]] from occurring
                            - [[insight]] is also key to be [[creative]]
                            - What I'm understanding so far is that structure is key to good, creative, insightful writing. 
                                - there are many parts that go into writing
                                    - these all have to be done well to produce good work
                                        - this isn't the same as planning
                                - [[good structure]] provides you with [[insight]] which fuels progress
                    - the opposite of a [[plan]] is not [[aimlessness]]
                    -  having a [[plan]] has a place (i.e. passing exams) but it will not help you learn/write/takenotes
            - the a [[good structure]] (system) does not need to be complex
            - a simple [[system]] will allow for ideas to be complex
                - the system will require low energy to maintain allowing for the energy to go into idea developing
    - good [[note taking]] relies on two ideas
        - 1. the technique of slip-box
            - this will be elaborated later
        - 2. routine 
            - (i'm beginning to think this book sucks)
    - [[1.2 The Slip-box]]
        - Luhmann wrote one idea (note) per slip card
            - the [[note]] was only as good as it's context
                - the context does not have to be the same as the one it originated from
            - he began wondering how he could tie his [[note]]s together
        - Misunderstandings about Luhmann's system include: 
            - isolated focus on the slip-box
                - leads to neglect of actual workflow
            - notes on his system were in german and discussed in very private groups
                - not widely accessible
            - it is simple
                - it is impossible for something simple to have grandiose results. 
    - [[1.3 The slip-box manual]]
        - two [[slip-box]]es
            - 1. contained [[Bibliography]]
            - 2. contained his main notes
        - steps for [[note]] taking:
            - step 1:
                - read/see/percieve/think
                - write note
                - write reference
            - step 2: 
                - draw inferences from content of step 1 
                - write it down
                    - [[note]]s were generally simple/concise
                        - he would allow himself to expand on them on other notes
                        - [[note]]s were written as if he was writing to submit for publication.
                        - sometimes a new [[note]] would follow up on a previously written one.
                            - I wonder if I'm using this system incorrectly.
            - whenever a [[note]] is added, check your box for other relevant notes
- writing [[note]]s is not the main part of writing a paper [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
    - however, it is the easiest part
- [[note]]s are the product of thinking, reading, and understanding, which are the main part of writing a paper [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
- fleeting notes: notes that pop into your mind without effort 
    - jot these down; 
- #Zettels [[Testing this css out]]
    - #[[Literature Notes]] Doing the format this way will allow my notes to be neat
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The individual didn't seem to understand what a fleeting note was
- #Zettels [[The consistency of our work is only as good as the systems we instate for ourselves]]
    - #[[Literature Notes]] A good system prevents us from failing [[((59-bYYcu-))]]
    - #[[Literature Notes]] Our systems can make life productive and enjoyable
