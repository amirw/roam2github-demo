    - I think the book is one of the most valuable that I have ever read. That said, I think it could be written much better and it might even highlight a possible inadequacy of the Zettelkasten  method.
    - Here is my commentary on the latter point. Evrything I have ever read from editors and experts in writing non-academic nonfiction, and academic as well, stresses the imprtance of concision. And almost all the authors who had good editors who forced them to cut significant parts out of their books later conceded that their book would have been significantly less successful if the authors had stuck to their guns and kept everything in.
    - So, the whole point of the Zettelkasten is to make connections. and I think that that is great.
        - But the point for me is that before actually writing a text for publication, it is time to focus with great intensity on the point. And all that tangential stuff needs to be cut.
    - If this were only a problem with Ahrens, then it might be passed over as an individual quirk. But I noticed a similar failing with [[[[Steven Johnson]] Where Good Ideas Come From]]. 
        - He never defined his terms and seemed to write a bunch of chapters about things that only hung together rather loosely.
        - He wanted to show how ecosystems were like coffeehouses and how the attributes of gas, solid, and liquid could apply to completely distinct domains.
        - But he never defined his terms and I found it frustrating.
    - With Sonke, the problem was a bit different. He just seemed to go all over the place. He had a ton of paper citations. But so what? The question is whether all those bits add up to a coherent theory of learning and if they contribute to a theory of Zettelkasten. And my takeaway was mixed.
    -  I think the whole thing about literature notes is a non-issue. In my life I have been taking literature notes since I began college. Before that, in high school, I don't remember ever taking notes in class.
    - then in college, really early on, I had a bit of a panicky feeling when I realized that this stuff was hard and the things that wre taught earlier in the semester had already left my memory by mid-semester and I was going tto be screwed.
    - My problem personally was that after I started with Roam, which happened after I finished reading Ahrens book, I was all psyched about doing a Zettelkasten.
    - And actually, I tried Zetteling first in Evernote. and there I created an outline of Zettels. 
    - Then I decided that Roam was a shinier fancier toy and didn't want to commit to Evernote.
    - So I took that outline Zettel that I had created in Evernote and put it into Roam.
    - The problem was that when I read books and articles after that< did not create more Zettels and I never linked any Zettels.
    - Nothing changed for me until I started the Roam Book Club 1. Adn there was knew that my goal was to create permanent notes.
    - But only gradually did I learn that I wasn't linking. so I started doing that.
    - and that leads me right into what I am giving today as a presentation. On the importance and how to link permanent notes.
    - the sync button just turned amber. I should copy all this to my personal database now.

    - 
        - Wow! I am doing freewriting. Ihaven't really done freewriting for a long, long, long time. Basically Ahrens convinced me that there is no need to freewrite. Basically freewriting is just like brainstoriming. and the whole point of zettelkasten is that there is never a blank page. so, really, I don't know about the benefit.
        - But maybe I can reconceptualie this as free recall/ And there is n my mind great benefits to free recall.
        - So, I will do what's on m mind. And lately, today while exercising in Riverside park, doing a few hours of hill repeats, I kept going back to learning theory. It s only recently that I made the connection between learning theory in the behaviorist sense and learning more generally. And today while walking up those stair I kept wondering if maybe chunking was somehting like chaining, but I don't really remember exactly the detials of chaining from a behaviorist pint of view. And even chunking could be somehting like shaping by successive approximations. 
        - So, how ould I teach smeone else to Zettelkasten in Roam?
        - Well, first tngs first. And even Ahrens mighht not agree with this first assertion. But it is clear to me that the note must be a page. Or, in greater detail, that which is a note in a Zettelkasten system is a page in Roam.
        - Some have argued that the permanent note is an atomic thought and that this is a block in Roam.
        - But I don't like this one bit because the whole thiing in Luhmann's conception of z Zettelkasten is that there are connectioins among notes. and really, Roam is NOT about linked blocks. There are block references but it quickly gets messy to have multiple references in a single block. and, of course, there are no backlinks in blocks. So, since links define connections in Roam, and only pages have backlinks, only pages can be notes.
        - The next issue is how much of the note goes in the title vs in the body. And this is a sticky wicket. What if I don't want to make 3 mor notes to justify another note? I guess that that is a judgment call.

        - "Pick from the prompts below and write in your own page for 25 minutes."
            - "You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say? "
                - What
                    - I will tell them that a Zettelkasten is a method for retaining and expanding knowledge of stuff that is important to you
                        - create a "note," or written declarative sentence for ideas that you believe you will want to retain in your long-term memory for many years
                        - flag that note with references to other notes that are relevant to it.
                - Why
                    - Zettelkasten is a method that is perhaps the best availabe to
                        - engage in lifelong learning of stuff that is important and meaningful, and
                        - enable one to produce texts over a life on stuff that is important to menaingful
                    - it functions so well because it jives with the best current cognitive models
                        - meaningful learning consists of connecting new information with knowledge that already resides in long-term memory
                            - the Zettelkasten method strongly encourages you to make explicit connections between new information as expressed by a new note with already-existing notes which express knowledge previously acquired
                        - expertise consists in
                            - storing knowledge in larger and larger chunks
                                - as said above, we are encouraged to link our notes together. this creates larger and larger chunks
                            - retrieving knowledge by associating it with more and more cues
                                - when links are made directional, a kind of cue-response pair is created. As more and more directional links are created there are more and more such pairs
                        - cognitive load theory focuses on minimizing extraneous information
                            - since a Zettelkasten is much more labor-intensive than less-formal traditional methods of note-taking the practitioner quickly learns to stop reading texts that have a lower likelihood of being valuable

                - "Transferring ideas into the external memory also allows us to forget them. And even though it sounds paradoxical, forgetting actually facilitates long-term learning. It is important to understand why, because there are still many students who shy away from using an external memory. They fear that they would have to choose between remembering things in their heads (which wouldnât require an external memory) or in the external memory (which then would be forgotten in the internal memory). That this is a false choice becomes obvious as soon as we understand how our memory truly works."
                - Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. . . These kinds of notes are just reminders of a thought, which you havenât had the time to elaborate on yet. Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.

    - Questions for us from [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]]
        1. What have you learnt about note taking that I (SÃ¶nke) should know about?
            - it might make sense to number the permanent notes even in Roam.
                - this isn't because a Luhmann-like __Folgenzettel__ is inherently a good thing. Clearly it was an artifact of using analog slips of paper that needed to be stored in some order.
                - rather, inserting a note into a sequene forces us to slow down, and consolidate the thought represented by the note.
                - and Folgenzettel are just one of a number of ways that such consolidation can be achieved. (I guess the rest is more like quesiton 2)
        2. Are there any additions to the process described in the book?
            - ways to consolidate the thoughts being represented by our notes
                - links to tags
                    - when a note is tagged, it is accessible, via 2 clicks, to other notes similarly tagged
                - links to other pages
                    - when I write a new note and put in its body a link to an already-existing note, the latter is accessible via 1 click to the related note
                    - similarly I can list more than one already-existing note in the body of the newly-created note.
                    - I can put the already-existing notes into an order that has some kind of intuitive pull, without explicitly stating the basis of the order
                        - alternatively or additionally, I can use Roam to create a Folgenzettel by preceding all notes with a number and using the sort by title in the "all pages" view
                    - I can put the already-existing notes into an explicitly-stated order
                    - I can explicitly state the relationships among the already-existing notes entered into the body of the newly-created note
            - spaced specification
                - if you look at the sequence above, the links among notes become more and more specific.
            - an important question is "where to enter the permanent note?"
                - I like entering them in the body of the bibliographic reference
                - this creates a very strong connection, since, presumably, all the notes created when working on one text will tend to to have a kind of unity
            - How to present all this information sequentially so that others can grasp it?
                - check out the Learning how to Learn video series for ideas.

            - write everything down 
        - Two common misconceptions that this otherwise [insightful article](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) endorses and that [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] got right
            1. Principle of Atomicity
                - I have the highest respect for Christian and Sascha of zettelkasten.de and they are credited with formulating this principle of the Zettelkasten method. It is usually said to state that each permanent note consists of a single thought or idea.
                    - The motivation for this principle seems to be that we must tear down texts into their constituent parts, put the interesting parts into our slip box, and then recombine those parts to create our own texts. I agree with this.
                    - Since we are tearing down into constituent parts, we are tearing down into atoms, hence, the Principle of Atomicity.
                - I believe that it is a mistake to promulgate this principle (and I could paste many, many web pages that reiterate the primacy of this principle) because it overshadows a more primary principle, thereby misdirecting novices from the fundamental ontology of networked thought.
                - Learning rests on the ability to aggregate simple ideas or actions into increasingly more complex combinations of ideas or actions. This is often called chunking and it refers to the modular nature of our minds.
                    - First, we learn to press one keyboard key with one finger.
                    - Then we learn to combine sequences of keypresses.
                    - Now I am typing this and I am not thinking about each finger separately.
                - The example that [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] gives of [[Solomon Shereshevsky]] illustrates the problems a person who has a limited capacity for chunking experiences.
                - The contents of our minds are fractal in nature, which means that what looks like an indivisible unit from one perspective (e.g. the individual human being for a demographer) could be an aggregation of many units from a different perspective (a complex consisting of a circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, digestive system, etc. for a clinician).
                - The concept of an atom is relative to the level of analysis that one is taking.
                - Hence, the Principle of Atomicity runs at cross-purposes to the primitive chunkability or modularity of the ideas and thoughts expressed in our permanent notes.
                - If we must formulate a decalogue for the Zettelkasten, we might consider starting with Thou Shalt Write Chunkabe Notes.
                    - The learned commentators will explicate this as follows:
                        - Any note should be combinable or connectable with another note.
                - More simply, we should replace the Principle of Atomicity with the Principle of Chunkability.
            2. Principle of Inclusivity
                - That's my label for the essay's injunction:
                    -  "Add notes without fear. You can never have too much information in your Zettelkasten."
                - This principle is also in many other analyses of the Zettelkasten, including Steven Johnson's [[Books/Where Good Ideas Come From]] which advises us to "write everything down" (83).
                - Just as the Principle of Atomicity, was not baseless, neither is this Principle of Inclusivity.
                - We should create permanent notes when we get a hunch that we think might, after some incubation, turn someday into a good idea.
                - But [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] and even the zettelkasten.de guys (with their formulation of the "collector's fallacy") ably put the lie to the idea that we should capture everything:
                    - A friend of mine does not let any idea, interesting finding or quote he stumbles upon dwindle away and writes everything down. He always carries a notebook with him and often makes a few quick notes during a conversation. The advantage is obvious: No idea ever gets lost. The disadvantages are serious, though: As he treats every note as if it belongs to the âpermanentâ category, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. . . . It is not surprising that my friend has a bookshelf filled with notebooks full of wonderful ideas, but not a single publication to show. [*](((7GWVsCHA5)))
                - Instead of shoveling everything into our slip box, we should, again, follow the advice of [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] (70) and be more discriminating:
                    - The slip-box forces us to be selective in reading and note-taking, but the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections.[*](((2J1X0Ixx_)))
                - More simply, we should replace the Principle of Inclusivity with the Principle of Selectivity.

Because it should not be used as an archive, where we just take out what we put in, but as a system to think with, the references between the notes are much more important than the references from the index to a single note. Focusing exclusively on the index would basically mean that we always know upfront what we are looking forâwe would have to have a fully developed plan in our heads. But liberating our brains from the task of organizing the notes is the main reason we use the slip-box in the first place." [*](((UjeoZyqmz)))

                        - My experience is that I must have many passes through important texts because each time I find new connections and can formulate new insights. This applies even to [[How to Take Smart Notes]]

            - General Comments
                - 09:15 the [[limitations of our brains]] that the [[Zettelkasten]] overcomes is:
                    - brains overvalue current ideas and discount ideas we had in the past; the slip box values all times of creation equally
                    - brains store information in a distorted way; the slip box is accurate
                    - writing is like explaining an idea to others

                    - Intra-page connections
                        - Treat a block as a note
                            - this permits the creation of longer pages
                            - a single page can be a kind of [[Folgezettel]] or sequence of notes, where each block within the page is a note
                    - Inter-page connections
                        - Make a page showing [[Folgezettel]] or sequence of notes, where each note in the page is a link to a different page
                        - state explicitly the nature of the relations among the notes; do not merely list them. E.g.:
                            - conflicts with
                            - provides evidence for

                            - the relation among all the notes is that they share the property that the tag represents
                        - Make a cluster page using a multi-concept (multi-word) title
                            - this might be a register

                    - block
                        - explicitly state the connection that links one block to another
                            - if it is true that (block1 and block2 and (block3 or block4)) then it must be true that block5
                - single-concept [[tag]]
                    - page
                        - all nodes are similar to each other along the dimension defined by the single-concept tag
                            - all the pages tagged "social science"
                - multi-concept cluster
                    - page
                        - all nodes are similar to each other along the dimension defined by the multi-concept cluster
                            all the pages clustered by the page "ecological ramifications of SARS-CoV-2"
                - Inter-page
                    - page
                        - explicitly state the connection that links one page to another
                            - if it is true that (page1 and page2 and (page3 or page 4)) then it must be true that page5
            - Comments:
                - The intra-page link seems to violate the standardization principle that the containerization story illustrated. I want to automate the structure of my system so that each thought that can stand on its own is represented by a permanent note. I do not want to have to decide, before writing a note, if I should make it one note with multiple sub-ideas as blocks, or multiple notes. 
                - The distinction between the [[tag]] and the cluster strikes me more as a difference of degree rather than of kind.
                - If I were to modify my system according to the previous two comments, I would end up with two kinds of links:
                    - inter-page
                        - in [this example](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zVFGpprS64TzmKGNzGxq9FiCDnAnCPwRU5T) from [[Andy Matuschak]], the relations among the nodes are temporal, not logical.
                    - a combination of tag and cluster
                        - [this example](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/%C2%A7Corporate_research_lab_practices) from [[Andy Matuschak]]
                - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] has been nudging us to create some kind of uniform nomenclature to distinguish the types of links. The names that I have used here are not particularly helpful. First, I think we need to test whether this taxonomy makes sense. Second, if it does, I am sure we could come up with more mellifluous names.
