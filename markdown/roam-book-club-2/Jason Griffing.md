    - Questions for Sonke
        - What have you learned about note taking that Sonke should know about? 
            - I have learned to think about notes in a fundamentally different way. Before, I was taking notes without any real understanding of what I was ever going to do with those notes. It was the collector's fallacy. It felt like the right thing to do, but it was kind of pointless. With the [[zettelkasten]] approach, I understand that the purpose of taking notes is to:
                - Solidify my own understanding
                - Find interesting connections
                - Build my own original thinking from the bottom-up
            - In short, this approach has fundamentally changed how I think about the act of taking notes. This has freed me to feel less obligated to take notes on everything I read. 
        - Additions to the process described in the book? 
            - None I can think of
        - Range of possibilities and limitations
            - I do not think I have pushed the [[Zettel]] method far enough to come close to its limitations. 
        - What use-cases does it work for? Any it doesn't?
            - I have only used it so far for a limited set of goals (research and developing content) and it seems to work great for those. Again, I don't think I've pushed the method far enough to find limitations yet. 
        - Reflections on the book
            - One of the best books I read this year. A surprisingly interesting read that has fundamentally altered and improved my ability to generate ideas. I am grateful to have discovered this book. 
        - What about your note-taking has changed?
            - My note taking is far more methodical. There's a repeatable process for flagging ideas of interest and then processing them. I have also found that my ability to abstract out the most important ideas for a text has dramatically improved. 
        - Do you plan to continue using the zettel method
            - I plan to continue trying to ðŸ˜ƒ. I am planning to read the book again at some point after I've played around with the system more. The concepts all more or less make sense to me, but translating them into practice in my specific context has proved challenging.

            - "**Writing is an essential part of the thinking process, not just a byproduct of it: **Famous thinkers from [[Benjamin Franklin]] to [[Richard Feynman]] emphasize the importance of externalizing your ideas through writing. This helps us not only retain the information better, but it also deepens our understanding and allows us to find interesting connections that lead to new, original ideas. (20)"
            - "**Writing creates the distance needed to scrutinize an argument:** Only by writing arguments down do they become fixed enough to be scrutinized. The brain is too eager to make us feel good, so it easily glosses over inconsistencies in our own thinking. Writing puts distance between us and our thoughts so we can look at them objectively. Formulating an argument and scrutinizing an argument are two different tasks. Getting the former on paper frees up mental resources to focus on the latter. (93)"
            - "**Thinking on paper:** Seeing [[Richard Feynman]]'s collection of notebooks, a journalist once commented about this "wonderful record" of Feynman's thinking. To which Feynman replied, "No, no! They aren't a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on paper." (93)"

            - "**Focus on the essential only:** There is a story about NASA trying to figure out how to make a ballpoint pen that would work in space. According to the story, the agency invested all kinds of time and money developing an "anti-gravity" pen that would push ink to the tip using compressed nitrogen. The Russians, who faced the same challenge, used a pencil. It turns out this story is apocryphal, but the takeaway is powerful all the sameâ€”focus on the essential; avoid everything else.

            - "**The difference between understanding and memorization:** See if you can memorize the following sequence of numbers simply by looking at it: 

   â€” 11 95 82 19 62 31 96 64 19 70 51 19 74

Hard, right? Until you realize that it is comprised simply of sequential series of World Cup years:

   â€” (1) 1958, (2) 1962, (3) 1966, (4)1970, (5) 1974

Knowing how the numerical string was arrived at, you are now able to recite it with ease. This simple exercise perfectly captures the difference between memorization and true understanding. Always strive for the latter. Memorizing and regurgitating complex concepts is not the same as truly grasping the principles behind them. (65)"
            - "**Remember less, not more:** [[Solomon Shereshevsky]] is one of the most famous people in the history of psychology. He had a remarkable ability to memorize and recall almost anything. He could, for instance, recite verbatim every single word of any meeting he had attended (without taking any notes). This may sound like a wonderful ability, but there was a serious drawback. Shereshevsky was almost incapable of grasping the gist of anything. He could not distinguish between key arguments, relevant facts, and inconsequential details. This illustrates how gaining wisdom is not a matter of merely retaining facts; it is about learning to focus on the essential. (98)"
            - "**The value of active inhibition:** We tend to think of forgetting as the loss of memory. In fact, it's more complicated than that. Psychologists use a term called [[active inhibition]] to describe the erection of a mental barrier between our conscious mind and our long-term memory. Without this filter, we would constantly be flooded with memories, making it all but impossible to focus on the task at hand. [[Solomon Shereshevsky]] struggled with this. For example, when trying to buy ice cream, some random work uttered by the vendor would trigger a cognitive flood of associations and memories so overwhelming he would have to leave the shop. (98)"
    - ## [[Literature notes]]
        - **Cultivate the right habits:** The overall quality of your writing and the ease with which it comes together depends more than anything else on the work you have done before you even selected the topic. To be an effective writer, one has to cultivate the right daily habitsâ€”namely, a disciplined and rigorous dedication to taking effective notes (2)
        - **You cannot plan for insight, but you can create the right conditions for it:** Top-down, rigid planning based on a desire to arrive at a pre-determined conclusion is not the way to do it. Neither is aimless fucking around. The key is to create a workflow which is highly organized yet flexible enough to allow for surprising connections to emerge. Then, use the insight to drive your work to wherever it wants to take you. (6)
        - **Follow your interests: **It is important to allow your insights and passions to guide your work. Luhmann famously talked about the fact that he never worked on things he didn't want to work on. One might be tempted to think that he was so prolific in spite of this fact. In actuality, it was __because of it.__ Luhmann was not constricted by preconceived notions of what he should be working on. Instead, he exposed himself to a wide variety of inputs, then created a system whereby he could allow surprising connections to emerge and guide his work. (14)
            - #[[F: Follow your interests]]
        - **Decorrelating effort and outcome:** We are so conditioned to believe that a great outcome always requires a great effort that we have a hard time believing a small change to our workflow could make a big difference. But just like Henry Ford's contemporariesâ€”who did understand why something as simple as the conveyor belt was such a big dealâ€”we should not underestimate the power of small changes. (16) #[[F: Leverage. Looking for low-effort, high impact]] 
        - **Writing is an essential part of the thinking process, not just a byproduct of it: **Famous thinkers from [[Benjamin Franklin]] to [[Richard Feynman]] emphasize the importance of externalizing your ideas through writing.

Formulating an argument and scrutinizing an argument are two different tasks. Getting the former on paper frees up mental resources to focus on the latter. (93)
        - **Exergonic vs endergonic reactions:** Exergonic reactions require that energy be constantly added to them in order for them to keep going. Conversely, endergonic reactions, once triggered, sustain themselves and even release excess energy. In some respects, work is no different; some tasks drain us, others ignite us. The key is to make our work align as much as possible with the things that ignite us. In this way, the work itself becomes the reward, instead of the thing we force ourselves to do to reach the reward. (51)
        - **The role of circular feedback in creating growth:** Carol Dweck argues that a "growth mindset" is the most reliable predictor of success. And one of the most important ways to grow is to actively seek feedback. Most of us, however, are conditioned to seek feedback linearlyâ€”at a quarterly performance review or when the first draft of our big paper is complete. Instead, we should follow a circular approach, seeking feedback on the quality of our work __as we work on it.__ (51)
        - **Dirty first drafts:** It is very difficult to translate ideas, especially complex ones, into linear text in our heads. If we worry about pleasing our inner critic, or the critical reader, with perfectly structured prose from the beginning, our creative process will grind to a standstill. Focus first on getting your thoughts on paper, where you can see them. Only then can they really be improved (61).
        - **Narrow focus vs floating focus:** We tend to associate success in fields like science with the ability to focus deeply and narrowly on a specific problem. While more "floating" types of focus are generally associated with success only in creative fields like art and music. According to [research](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-01867-013), however, the most eminent scientists were distinguished not necessarily for their ability to relentless focus, but rather for their flexibility. The ability, in other words, to switch between rigorous focus and playful exploration is a muscle we should all strive to develop.

        - **Short-term memory is limited; get ideas out of your head:** Psychologists tend to agree that we are capable of holding a maximum of about seven items in our short-term memory, plus/minus two. In other words, our short-term memory is a precious resource. We should not squander it. Instead, we should build external systems to which we can "delegate" the retention of information. (68)
        - **Focus on the essential only:** There is a story about NASA trying to figure out how to make a ballpoint pen that would work in space. According to the story, the agency invested all kinds of time and money developing an "anti-gravity" pen that would push ink to the tip using compressed nitrogen. The Russians, who faced the same challenge, used a pencil. It turns out this story is apocryphal, but the takeaway is powerful all the sameâ€”focus on the essential; avoid everything else.

        - **The Zeigarnik Effectâ€”write things down:** This phenomenon describes how open tasks will occupy our short-term memory until they are completed. This explains why thoughts of unfinished tasks are so distracting to us. But Zeigarnik's follow-up research found something interestingâ€”in order to get our brains to stop thinking about an incomplete task, we don't actually have to complete it. All we have to do is write it down in a place where we are convinced it will get taken care of later. Amazingly, the brain does not appear to distinguish between a completed task and one that has simply been captured and postponed to a later date. (68)
        - **The Zeigarnik Effectâ€”letting things linger:** We can use the Zeigarnik Effect to our advantage by deliberately leaving unanswered questions in our heads. By taking advantage of our brain's tendency to focus on unfinished tasks, we allow our brains an opportunity to ruminate on a problem in a different, and often highly productive way. 
            - >> I seem to recall Josh Waitzkin talking about "feeding his brain complexity" at night to let it work on the problem as he slept. See if I can find that. I believe it may have been on the Tim Ferris show. 
        - **Minimize your decisions:** Create a repeatable system. Always capture your fleeting notes in the same manner; always use the same approach to extract the main ideas from a text; always convert these into permanent notes in the same way; etc. Every decision you eliminate from your process frees up cognitive horsepower to focus on more value-added tasks such as creating original ideas or solving complex problems. #OneMinute
        - **How Charles Darwin dealt with confirmation bias:** To overcome [[F: Confirmation bias]], [[Charles Darwin]] forced himself to elaborate in writing on the arguments that were most critical to his theories. He did this because he found that these critical arguments were "far more apt to escape from the memory than favorable ones."

        - [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]
            - I'm currently reading [[Essays and Aphorisms]] by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. There's an essay titled "On Thinking for Yourself" where he says the following: 

__" As the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one, so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value to you than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself; because only through ordering what you know by comparing every truth with every other truth can you take complete possession of your knowledge."__ #Quotes

This was written in the 1850s. Schopenhauer was also German. Pure speculation, butÂ  I can't help but wonder if [[Niklas Luhmann]] was influenced by this.
