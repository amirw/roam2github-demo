            - By adding a small but immediate or instinctive step or behaviour, we can leverage our desire, and minimise the effort needed, to make the next necessary step. 
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A reminder of GTD inbox. The reassurance of knowing WITBD. Behaviours > habits √  
            - Reminds me a little of Getting Things Done, particularly the idea of the ‘inbox’ into which one offloads any task. 
            - I use the Things task manager to prompt me to do certain daily tasks so I no longer have to think about them. Likewise, I feel reassured that by putting every task into Things that there is nothing will forget or, rather, that I know exactly what I am __not__   doing! 
            - The idea that when behaviours can be turned into habits they are will be more easily taken advantage of.
