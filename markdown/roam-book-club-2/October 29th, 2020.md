- (copying these over from v1 database - a chat from [[Mike Kramer]] that I want to be visible over here in bookclub v2:)
    - #sub #Chat #bug-reports [[@Charlie M]] weird bug - I wrote the above, but I can see that you have been granted "ownership" ([[Matt Brockwell/MJB]])
- #Chat [[Mike Kramer]] Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method by the Archive guys 
#deepdive #Zettelkasten
    - https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/
        - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] __although this site is a wealth of information, there is room outside of what they deem "the way" for exploration, and especially in regards to__ [[Roam]]__'s technological advances to link at a block-level.__
        - __I actually much prefer__ [[Daniel Lüdecke]]__'s take on __[[Zettelkasten]]__ in a digital form__
        - "Luhmann himself stated that his productivity stems from working in a partnership with his Zettelkasten. This strikes a chord with people investigating the Zettelkasten Method.(2)"
            - NB they do NOT say that the Zettelkasten was what made Luhmann so accomplished, merely that Luhmann modestly affirmed that.
                - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] __"One of the most basic presuppositions of communication is that the partners can mutually surprise each other."__ [Source](https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes)
                - cf [[How to Take Smart Notes]] which does seem to say that if I do a slip-box I will become Luhmann-like
        - "The Zettelkasten Method streamlines our workflow by giving clear guidelines on what to do. This, in turn, decreases friction. It is quite common to enter a stage of flow which further increases productivity. "
            - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] __Just because the friction is decreased it doesn't mean the difficulty of effort over time is any less strenuous __
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club%2FBP_IARQyFm.jpg?alt=media&token=75fc878b-316b-42ba-83be-6d5127b8b331)
            - I question this. I think [[Robert A. Bjork]] concept of desirable difficulty has some merit, so decreasing friction is not necessarily a desideratum
        - The Principle of Atomicity
            - "each Zettel only contains one" thought 'and one only"
                - both [[Barbara Oakley]] and [[Steven Johnson]] emphasize that what is complex at one level of analysis is atomic at another level. See the concept of "[[chunking]]" in [[[[Barbara Oakley]] A Mind for Numbers]]
        - the "body" of the Zettel is the thought
            - we of the [[Roam Book Club]], and I would claim [[Andy Matuschak]]have been creating pithy titles which capture the thought.
                - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] __"The technical requirements of slip boxes involve wooden boxes, which have drawers that can be pulled open, and pieces of paper in octavo format (about half of a letter-size sheet). We should only write on one side of these papers so that in searching through them, we do not have to take out a paper in order to read it."__ [Source](https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes)
                - __I'm not against short titles that summarize succinctly, but also remember that this process is a derivative of an analog form__
            - if we choose to have a body, it is elaboration
            - we have an explicit "related claims" section
                - they argue that if you just list related claims without explanation "you will not create knowledg." 
                    - I think that statement might be too strong, but I agree with its spirit
        - Structure notes
            - [[@Beau Haan]]said during the zoom session that the Folgezettel obviates the need for Structure Notes
                - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] this split that happened between [[Daniel Lüdecke]] and the Zettelkasten.de guys was most apparent in the forum threads from 2015, but the way the word "Structure Notes" are used is different, since [[Sönke Ahrens]]'s speaks of the need to be able to create entry-points into the [[Zettelkasten]], compared to:
                    - __"With the Folgezettel technique you __have__ to give each note a place. With Structure Notes you __need__ to give each note a place."__ [Source](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/8302#Comment_8302)
                - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] __as for what exactly a __[[Folgezettel]]__ is, this __[article](https://medium.com/@ethomasv/the-folgezettel-conundrum-20b14dc986ec)__ explains it pretty well, without the beef between the two camps...__
                    - __And what I'm getting at, and probably the most important aspect of all of this, is how __[[Roam]]__'s capacity to handle data differently from other note-taking tools is what might be the difference that can effectively transmute the analog signal into a digital domain--without losing that analog hum __[Analog vs. Digitial](https://urm.academy/making-digital-sound-analog-the-best-of-both-worlds/)
                - Maybe I misunderstood him, since my reading of [[How to Take Smart Notes]] was that Luhmann had both

- #[[Chat]] [[Rahul Kurup]] #query #Chat
    - Hi! Does anyone know how to superscript text in Roam?
    - Also, is there a reason why the # # chat is coming up as an icon (waving hand) when typed by others, but not when I create the tag?
    - Danke!
    - [[Alex Shchedrin]]: [re # # chat](((TpUBDWaIH))), if you use a single # with a word 'chat', this will match the custom CSS, which adds a waving hand
    - And as for your [superscript text question](((-X3xq7iID))) you can use LaTeX formatting: `$$^{hello}$$` will produce $$^{hello}$$
    - Note that LaTeX will not work with links, so if you want to use superscript for footnotes, then you would need to go the custom CSS route
    - I feel block references is a more elegant way to add footnotes / elaborations on a paragraph.

    - Fleeting Notes::
        - "[[Introduction]]"
            - "Most writing advices is focused on large writing but most writing happens everyday in small bits. This is the writing that is most numerous and also what we should work to perfect. Writing is the medium of understanding."
            - "Note taking is the pre-work. The ground work that we do in the time before the blank page and the deadline."
        - "[[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]"
            - "[[1.1 Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected]]"
                - "Work to lessen your [[cognitive load]] / overhead. The more you need to keep in your head the less thinking you can do. This is what a #[[note taking]] 'system' is for, scaffolding for your thoughts."
                    - "How does this translate to #architecture? Does it lend itself to taking 'process' notes or maybe 'workflow' notes?"
                - "Taking Smart notes boils down into two concepts: The slip box and a consistent routine."
                - "GTD from [[Getting Things Done]] works very well for tasks were the goal is clearly defined not ones (like writing or design) where the path is meandering."
            - "[[1.2 The Slip-box]]"
                - "[[Niklas Luhmann]], creator of the #[[slip-box]], worked in a way that is opposite of most. __"Instead of trying to squeeze as many publications out of one idea as possible ... he [tried] to squeeze as much insight and as many ideas as possible into one publication."__ This was due to how much he read, how much he notated, and __how__ he notated; the #slip-box."
                - "Constant adjustment must be {{or: integrated into the system | allocated | planned for}}. Forcing a creative endeavor will not lead to productive output so we must always be ready to pivot and re-adjust to align with our sense of fun and keep motivation."
                - "Success is environmentally based"
