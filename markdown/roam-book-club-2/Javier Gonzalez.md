    - [[Introduction]]
        - The bulk of writing that most people that write things is not published, it is the work that happens beforehand that people end up spending the most time on. Being systematic about this approach will improve the process and it can be geared towards a specific outcome. This outcome can be tweaked and manipulated to your advantage.
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - Structure
            - Given that academia and writing in academia is about connecting different ideas and generating new ones, you cannot plan for that. Planning for new ideas is a paradox
            - Structure gives you the possibility to take away the mental overhead of the process and focus on the subject. If you trust the process and the structure, then you can simply go into the work of creating something new and useful. 
            - This is for those that are doing the useful work of thinking outside the box, in between the lines, as the tools that we use should allow us to create a system to draw connections between different fields.
            - Working through outcomes is useful when the goal is clearly defined, but a system for learning and writing in new academic fields is necessarily open ended. It needs a system that allows us to jump back and forth between ideas to formulate the implications of their connections.
            - Luhman
                - An idea is only as useful as its context, which is not necessarily the one which it was taken from.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FJavier-knowledge-graph%2Fg4m4C8EhNk.png?alt=media&token=117f6c8c-d0a8-4ce5-8ef6-ca0c24ba0531)
                - His method allowed for developing connections between ideas that usually would become unnoticed. His structure became a companion to him, and one that would work in terms of a positive feedback loop.
                - Making the work more fun, makes you more productive
                - Insight oriented writing is open ended, and requires the flexibility to pivot as new insights arise, not to be categorized and suppressed, siloed and restrained.
                - The trick was that Luman did not organize notes by topic, but by fixed numbers which have no meaning with the [zettlekasten](((hVunxyWKT))) method
                    - If the note had a connection that he could draw, he would link it based on its unique address
                        - Lastly, he would later let indexes and categories emerge. He would categorize only afterwards, from the bottom up.
    - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
        - A system that could take out part of the list of tasks that are required when writing something.
        - The tasks
            - Collect notes and references about a topic
            - Outline the flow in which the piece will be structured
            - Fill in the outline with the details that will lead to your conclusion 
            - edit the piece to ensure coherence, tie up the loose ends
        - The steps to write a paper
            - Take fleeting notes - anything that comes to your mind
            - Take literature notes - reference your fleeting notes to put it into your own words
            - Take permanent notes, find out how it relates to your project or idea 
                - Place these in your slip box and link and index them, these are fully formed ideas
            - Allow ideas to form by themselves from your interaction with the system
                - See the connections that naturally emerge from the content which is being produced
    - [[Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have]]
        - traditional systems create friction in every step of the process of making connections between ideas
            - underlining thoughts create pockets of knowledge but does nothing to put them together with other thoughts,
            - where do the underlines go, where do the motes go?
        - you need a place for your fleeting thoughts and notes to go, accessible to you at all times. The idea is to externalize everything that goes through your brain when you are processing some new information 
            - there is no judgement when capturing these, they are there to serve as fleeting externalities that are captured momentarily
        - The reference system serves the purpose of organizing your thoughts around a reference, and the reference itself
    - [[Chapter 4. A Few Things to Keep in Mind]]
    - [[The Four Underlying Principles]]
        - [[Chapter 5. Writing is the Only Thing That Matters]]
            - Writing in academia is seen as an exercise that you do in order to reach a goal,  to finish writing a paper for example.
            - It is a distinct activity in academia with a predetermined end time
            - It is a skill that you learn in order to do independent research in the future
            - Sonke argues that writing and note taking should be looked at AS independent research
            - the thinking that happens around it is something that you will put into the world and have it be scrutinized by your peers
            - Academia is the process of making your work public, not just in publishing but in all that you do around it, in reviewing, in asking for input
            - Writing is the work that we do to externalize our ideas and have them create an impact in the world
            - Thinking about how you will write something down allows you to think differently about how you consume content, how you read and how you process it, because you externalize it
        - [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
            - shipping containers
                - they completely revolutionized am industry
                - it was a product of taking a simple idea,  or a problem - how do we deliver goods to consumers? and crafting a solution 
                - Looking at the problem without being buried in the traditional way, the conventions that people have about it allowed the inventor to think PAST the original solution and release efficiencies that would otherwise go undiscovered. this technique isnt new, but it is difficult, reminds me of how [hey.com](((ouIPudj9V)))  rethought email by starting from the first principles, or how satoshi nakamoto invented bitcoin amd created a new reality that we have to now contend with #[[design thinking]]
            - the note system rephrased the problem of writing notes to one end, producing written works that will exist in the world
                - it is meant to take the friction out of the recording of information. you dont have to worry about how to categorize your thoughts, or having to find them
                    - it does not get more complicated as it grows, it actually becomes simpler and the topics dont have to be brainstormed, but they actually emerge from the system itself
            - mistakes 
                - to treat everything as permanent
                    - hard to tell what is good what is relevant, what is trash or wrong
                - to only write things attached to current projects
                    - hard to know what will be useful in the future
                - to keep everything in its temporary state
                    - can get unwieldy quickly
                - mistakes are there because they make the system more complicated as it grows in size
            - fleeting notes are to keep your head in whatever it is you are doing, reading, or thinking, not to distract you from it
                - they are there to take an idea and remind you that there is something there
            - permanent notes are synthesized to create a system that allows you to reference them whenever you need to write about them.
            - they are processed and exist much less dependent on a context
            - Luhman would just reference the material as it caught his attention and would store it, but would also think of how it related to his thinking, and make notes of that in the context of his interests
                - a permanent note is no longer a reminder of an idea but it exists as a self contained idea in itself
        - [[Chapter 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch]]
            - writing is not linear yet when looking at guides on writing research papers the process described is linear
                - choose a topic -> do research -> collect bibliography -> write outline -> do more research -> fill in the outline -> edit
                    - this lacks a context and assumes that you are starting as a blank state
                    - writing is not linear, writing has to happen in each of these steps, and prior to each step
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FJavier-knowledge-graph%2FPtosOeSIXo.jpg?alt=media&token=6aefe8db-f838-4f12-94bd-4059bdcb19ac)
                    - ideas emerge from what you've already read and find interesting and if you have a system, then all the ideas that emerge come with associations and references already formed
                    - starting
                    - 
            - starting from a blank page is never that, and is just a symptom of having all the work that you have previously done inaccessible at the moment of writing
        - [[Chapter 8. Let the Work Carry You Forward]]
    - [[The Six Steps to Successful Writing]]
        - [[Chapter 9. Separate the Interlocking Tasks]]
            - __Psychologists who interviewed the multitaskers did test them instead of just asking. They gave them different tasks to accomplish and compared their results with another group that was instructed to do only one thing at a time. The outcome is unambiguous: While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased–a lot (Wang and Tchernev 2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009). Not only the quantity but also the quality of their accomplishments lagged significantly behind that of the control group. __ quote
                - I have definitely read this before, and it is an indictment of my behavioral patterns as they stand. I completely suffer from the dilemma of trying to do too many things at once
            - Multitasking is the process of doing a series of things in sequence, not of doing things at the same time.
                - It actually impedes our ability for learning a thing as it fatigues us before we get to the meat of it
            - Because writing **requires** us to work on multiple things at a time, then it is problematic unless we narrow it down to the distinct thing we are doing currently
            - __The good news is that we can train ourselves to stay focused on one thing for longer if we avoid multitasking, remove possible distractions and separate different kinds of tasks as much as possible so they will not interfere with each other. This too is not just a question of having the right mindset, but, equally important, of how we organise our workflow. A lack of structure makes it much more challenging to stay focused for extended periods of time. The slip-box provides not only a clear structure to work in, but also forces us to shift our attention consciously as we can complete tasks in reasonable time before moving on to the next one. Together with the fact that every task is accompanied by writing, which in itself requires undistracted attention, the slip-box can become a haven for our restless minds.__ - quote
                - Here there is where meditation has absolutely changed how I approach this process and how I train the muscles for holding my attention for longer periods of time. After years, I cannot imagine not doing it, but at the same time, I wonder if I am beginning to see diminishing returns.
                - I also absolutely see the value in the fleeting notes concept here, as they are made to minimize the context switching, place the minimum amount of effort in the fleeting note process, and go back (and dedicate the proper time) to it later
            - Writing requires multiple distinct activities
                - Proofreading is not writing, and it requires a completely different approach to it. 
                - __While taking on the role of a critic is not the same as being an impartial reader, it is enough to spot most of what we missed before: the holes in the argument, the parts we did not explain as we did not need to explain them to ourselves. To be able to switch between the role of critic and the role of writer requires a clear separation between these two tasks, and that becomes easier with experience. If we proofread a manuscript and don’t manage to get enough distance from ourselves as authors, we will only see our thoughts, not the actual text. It is a common issue that comes up during discussions with students: When I point out problems within the argument, an ill-defined term or just an ambiguous passage, students usually refer to what they mean first and only shift their focus to what they have written when they fully understand that what they mean is completely irrelevant within the scientific community.__ - quote
                    - Separating yourself from the content, and attempting to see the situation from an objective perspective is an excellent way to evaluate the content you are putting out
                - Writing cannot be done if simultaniously proofreading, as putting thoughts down is its own process that will be stunted by constantly evaluating the perfection of what is being jotted down
                    - There must be distinct processes for both
                - Other distinct domains of academic writing
                    - Researching, Outlining, Writing, Reading, Skimming, Proofreading
                        - Then you can get into the work of publishing, marketing, etc
                - __Psychologists used to associate scientific work exclusively with focused attention, while other, more floating kinds of attention were exclusively associated with creative work like art. We know today that we need both kinds of attention for art and science. It is not surprising, therefore, that this flexibility can be found among most, if not all, exceptional scientists. Oshin Vartanian compared and analysed the daily workflows of Nobel Prize winners and other eminent scientists and concluded that it is not a relentless focus, but flexible focus that distinguishes them. “Specifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas. This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible strategy application in relation to task demands.” (Vartanian 2009, 57)__ - quote
                    - Work done in states of deep focus is valuable, but only when combined with wide exploration and drawing connections from distinct ideas that you get to the most valuable insights.
                - __What psychologists do not discuss, though, are the external conditions that allow us to be flexible in the first place. The mental flexibility to be extremely focused for one moment and playfully explore ideas in the next is just one side of the equation. To be flexible, we need an equally flexible work structure that doesn’t break down every time we depart from a preconceived plan. One can be the best driver with the quickest reactions, able to adjust flexibly to different street and weather conditions. None of that will help a bit if the driver is stuck on rails. And it does not help us to have great insight into the necessity of being flexible in our work if we are stuck in a rigid organisation.__ - quote
                    - I firmly believe that the type of problem solving that we need today is flexible and interdisciplinary, creative, and broken out of silohs created by the categories of academic disciplines. 
                        - Disciplines, of course, give us structure and are great at arriving to narrow insights about a very specific idea (think of a phd thesis title)
                            - PHDs tent to go for the study of an extremely narrow subset of the population they are studying, in an extremely narrow timeframe, in an extremely narrow geographical location, taking an extremely narrow methodology. I have my doubts this type of work will lead to the solutions to what is sometimes referred to as wicked problems
            - "The moment we stop making plans is the moment we start to learn. It is a matter of practice to become good at generating insight and write good texts by choosing and moving flexibly between the most important and promising tasks, judged by nothing else than the circumstances of the given situation. It is similar to the moment where we had the training wheels of our bikes taken off and started to learn cycling properly. We might have felt a bit insecure in the first moment, but at the same time, it became obvious that we would never have learned to bicycle if we left the training wheels on. The only thing we would have learned is to ride a bike with training wheels on."
                - This is right in line with John Dewey's theory of experience and effective education. Since we learn from experience, creating situations that are totally isolated from the context in which the material will be applied, then the continuity of experience will be broken. This makes it so when it is time to apply the knowledge, it will seem unfamiliar.
            - Academic writing is an open ended and and indeterminate process, so it is akin to an art
                - That is to say, it cannot be planned
                - It requires embodied experience relating to ideas and their context, so there is no way to determine the context where it might be useful
            - "Hubert and Stuart Dreyfus, researchers on expertise, have a simple explanation: Teachers tend to mistake the ability to follow (their) rules with the ability to make the right choices in real situations. Unlike the expert paramedics, they did not look at the unique circumstances and check if the paramedics in the videos did the best thing possible in each individual situation. Instead, they focused on the question of whether the people in the videos acted according to the rules they taught."
                - This is a warning about the technique that this very book is trying to teach. Following the steps does not necessarily make you an expert in outputting useful content, it can just become a robotic process without the synthesis
            - 9.5
                - Memory requires effort, it is not a simple process of retrieving information
                    - The people that are most skilled at it, are able to use mnemonic devices to expand some of the limitation of the brain, but it is still active recollection of items that has to process each time we want to remember something
                    - Understanding something makes it require much less effort to recollect
                        - The zettlekasten is a tool for understanding something - making a mental model of it and drawing connections to other things in your mental database
                        - It becomes difficult to forget something once we draw the connection between the thing and other areas of (neurons) in our mind.
                - Our short term memory gets filled with open ended tasks, but gets dismissed when either they are done, or we have confidence that the task will be taken care of
                    - We don't waste brain cycles worrying about whether or not we finished the thing
                    - The zettlekasten also allows us to put away things that would otherwise be spinning brain cycles while we do the heavy activity "Researching, Outlining, Writing, Reading, Skimming, Proofreading"
            - 9.6
                - So far, we looked at memory, attention, and now we look at willpower
                - Willpower is not a trait, but a tool that we use, that wears out and needs recharging
                    - ego depletion
                        - the process of loosing willpower after exhausting it for overusing it
                - Forcing ourselves to do something that takes willpower is much harder than making ourselves (tricking) into liking the thing
                - making routines help the process of lowering the amount of decisions
                    - Same notetaking process, same writing process, same notebook
        - [[Chapter 10: Read for Understanding]]
            - "If you understand what you read and translate it into the different context of your own thinking, materialised in the slip-box, you cannot help but transform the findings and thoughts of others into something that is new and your own. It works both ways: The series of notes in the slip-box develops into arguments, which are shaped by the theories, ideas and mental models you have in your head. And the theories, ideas and mental models in your head are also shaped by the things you read. They are constantly changing and challenged by the surprising connections with which the slip-box confronts you. The richer the slip-box becomes, the richer your own thinking becomes. The slip-box is an idea generator that develops in lockstep with your own intellectual development. Together, you can turn previously separated or even isolated facts into a critical mass of interconnected ideas."
                - The thought which Sonkhe has been hinting at is to frontload the task of writing as early as the idea arrives in your head 
            - Reading with a pen is about having a dialogue with the material always, a dialogue which continues beyond the consumption of the material and goes into the process of synthesizing the information through writing about it
            - Every piece of text that is written exists within a context that you have to recontextualize into the context that you bring to the idea whenever you write about it
                - This is why it is pretty useless to just highlight things as you are reading them in a book.
            - You should always read with an eye to how your context (which is your slipbox) will fit into the material which you are consuming
            - "While the purpose of taking literature notes is as clear as the procedure, you are free to use whatever technique helps the most with understanding what you are reading and getting to useful notes–even if you use ten different colours for underlining and a SQ8R reading technique. But all of this would be just an extra step before you do the only step that really counts, which is to take the permanent note that will add value to the actual slip-box. You need to take some form of literature note that captures your understanding of the text, so you have something in front of your eyes while you are making the slip-box note. But don’t turn it into a project in itself. Literature notes are short and meant to help with writing slip-box notes. Everything else either helps to get to this point or is a distraction."
                - The end goal in this case is to introduce.a permanent note into your zettlekasten system to produce written content later, everything that you are doing is leading up to that
                - 10.2 Keep an Open Mind::
                    - Confirmation bias is an issue as our brain just plainly seeks out things that will allow it to feel better.
                    - Fighting it can be a systematic process, but as it was discussed earlier, every decision and mental strain will fatigue us making the process counter productive
                        -  "Multitasking is the process of doing a series of things in sequence, not of doing things at the same time."
                            - "It actually impedes our ability for learning a thing as it fatigues us before we get to the meat of it"
                    - We need a system to not have to think about it
                    - "The linear process promoted by most study guides, which insanely starts with the decision on the hypothesis or the topic to write about, is a sure-fire way to let confirmation bias run rampant. First, you basically fix your present understanding, as the outcome instead of using it as the starting point, priming yourself for one-sided perception. Then you artificially create a conflict of interest between getting things done (finding support for your preconceived argument) and generating insight, turning any departure from your preconceived plan into a mutiny against the success of your own project. This is a good rule of thumb: If insight becomes a threat to your academic or writing success, you are doing it wrong."
                        - Sonkhe loves shredding on the conventional model of academic writing, but it is apt to say that you have misaligned incentives when starting with a premise (that you are often times unsure if it holds according to the evidence)
                    - Reverting the order and allowing the topic to emerge from the collection of thinking that you have already done and from the evidence that you have already collected.
            - 10.3 Get the Gist::
                - "I suggest taking this literally. The ability to use one’s own understanding is a challenge, not a given. Luhmann stresses the importance of permanent notes in this regard: “The problem with reading academic texts seems to be that we need not the short-term memory, but the long-term memory to develop reference points for distinguishing the important things from the less important, the new information from the mere repeated. But it is of course impossible to remember everything. That would be rote learning. To put it differently: One has to read extremely selectively and extract widespread and connected references. One has to be able to follow recurrences. But how to learn it if guidance is impossible? […] Probably the best method is to take notes–not excerpts, but condensed reformulated accounts of a text. Rewriting what was already written almost automatically trains one to shift the attention towards frames, patterns and categories in the observations, or the conditions/ assumptions, which enable certain, but not other descriptions. It makes sense to always ask the question: What is not meant, what is excluded if a certain claim is made? If someone speaks of ‘human rights:’ What distinction is made? A distinction towards ‘non-human rights?’ ‘Human duties?’ Is it a cultural comparison or one with some historic people who didn’t have the concept of human rights, but lived okay together anyway? Often, the text does not give an answer or a clear answer to this question. But then one has to resort to one’s own imagination.” (Luhmann 2000, 154f)"
                    - Learning all the details. of a piece of writing is neither useful nor desireable, we want to look at the essence and draw the connections to and from it. Ruminating on the granular details will not advance us in our task to synthesize the knowlege we are receiving
            - 10.4 Learn to Read::
                - Teaching something is the best way to learn it and writing smart notes is the process of teaching something to your future self
                - We can easily confuse exposure and familiarity of a thing with understanding of the thing
                    - The good news is that we can absolutely test our understanding of a thing
                        - rephrasing what was said in our own words reveals the gaps in understanding that we have
                - "While it is obvious that familiarity is not understanding, we have no chance of knowing whether we understand something or just believe we understand something until we test ourselves in some form. If we don’t try to verify our understanding during our studies, we will happily enjoy the feeling of getting smarter and more knowledgeable while in reality staying as dumb as we were. This warm feeling disappears quickly when we try to explain what we read in our own words in writing. Suddenly, we see the problem. The attempt to rephrase an argument in our own words confronts us without mercy with all the gaps in our understanding. It certainly feels less good, but this struggle is the only chance we have to improve our understanding, to learn and move forward (cf. below). This, again, is deliberate practice. Now we are faced with a clear choice: We have to choose between feeling smarter or becoming smarter. And while writing down an idea feels like a detour, extra time spent, not writing it down is the real waste of time, as it renders most of what we read as ineffectual."
                    - It absolutely slows you down to take time to digest a written work, but it will be a much more productive use of the time if we are actually making the material stick and become integrated into ourselves with a purpose 
                - "It is not surprising, therefore, that the best-researched and most successful learning method is elaboration. It is very similar to what we do when we take smart notes and combine them with others, which is the opposite of mere re-viewing (Stein et al. 1984) Elaboration means nothing other than really thinking about the meaning of what we read, how it could inform different questions and topics and how it could be combined with other knowledge. In fact, “Writing for Learning” is the name of an “elaboration method” (Gunel, Hand, and Prain 2007). But there is a caveat. Even though elaboration works verifiably well for deep understanding, it might not be the best choice if you just want to learn isolated encyclopaedic facts (Rivard 1994). But as long as you are not striving for a career as a quiz show candidate, why would you want that, anyway? The slip-box takes care of storing facts and information. Thinking and understanding is what it can’t take off your shoulders, which is why it makes sense to focus on this part of the work. That it facilitates learning as well is a nice side effect. Luhmann almost never read a text twice (Hagen 1997) and was still regarded as an impressive conversation partner who seemed to have all information ready to hand.[ 30]"
                    - It is not only that focusing on the facts does not become conducive to understanding the material, rather it mught even be at odds.
                        - Outsource the memorization to the computer, they can do recall exponentially better than the best human, use your capacity for synthesizing information instead by explaining what you learned.
                            - "There is a clear division of labour between the brain and the slip-box: The slip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memory resource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brain to focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, and frees it up to be creative. Both the brain and the slip-box can focus on what they are best at."
                                - Relieve yourself of the rote task which you are notably imperfect at doing. Give that away, there is no use for it if you can outsource it. Worry about that which is most beneficial, which is understanding and sharing with others.
        - [[Chapter 11. Take Smart Notes]]
            - Success in reading is related to the ability to think beyond a text. Lonka 2003, 155f
            - Do not accept the arguments of a text as a given, but question it and develop a critical understanding of the fundamental reasons that the author holds that position. Engage, criticize and uncover the assumptions.
            - "Jerome Bruner, a psychologist Lonka refers to, goes a step further and says that scientific thinking is plainly impossible if we can’t manage to think beyond a given context and we only focus on the information as it is given to us (Bruner, 1973, quoted after ibid.) It is not surprising, therefore, that Lonka recommends what Luhmann recommends: Writing brief accounts on the main ideas of a text instead of collecting quotes. And she also stresses that it is no less important to do something with these ideas–to think hard about how they connect with other ideas from different contexts and could inform questions that are not already the questions of the author of the respective text."
                - We might be completely unable to reach any kind of understanding if we don't rephrase what we are learning and develop models of thinking that interconnect the subject matter with other nodes of ideas in our brain (or second brain)
            - 11.1 Make a Career One Note at a Time::
                - "The technique of writing a certain amount every day was perfected by Anthony Trollope, one of the most popular and productive authors of the 19th century: He would start every morning at 5: 30 a.m. with a cup of coffee and a clock in front of him. Then he would write at least 250 words every 15 minutes. This, he writes in his autobiography: “allowed me to produce over ten pages of an ordinary novel volume a day, and if kept up through ten months, would have given as its results three novels of three volumes each in the year” (Trollope, 2008, 272). And that, mind you, was before breakfast."
                    - Developing the atomic habit of writing a page a day can lead to a 300 page book in less than a year. We can even average a page a day and set the goal post to be a sentence every day. As James Clear puts it, it is much more of an issue to develop the habit than to achieve the far out goalpost that we see into the future.
                - "It does make sense to break down the work into manageable and measurable steps, but pages per day don’t work that well as a unit when you also have to read, do research and think. But even though academic and nonfiction writing involve more of other types of work than fiction writing, Luhmann managed to beat Trollope in productivity if you count his articles as well as his books. Luhmann wrote 58 books and hundreds of articles, while Trollope wrote 47 novels plus 16 other books. Granted, it might have something to do with the fact that Luhmann did some work after breakfast as well. But the main reason is the slip-box, which compares to Trollope’s technique as investing with compounded interest compares to a piggy-bank. Trollope is like a diligent saver who puts a little sum to the side every day, which adds up over time toward something impressive. Three dollars put aside each day (say, one takeout coffee) add up over the year to a small vacation ($ 1,000) and over a working life to a deposit on a flat as a permanent holiday retreat.[ 31] Putting notes into the slip-box, however, is like investing and reaping the rewards of compounded interest (which would in this example almost pay for the whole flat).[ 32]"
                    - Thinking in terms of compounding interest in your thinking, the more that we can relate our thoughts to other thoughts and ideas that we already have, as well as formulate them in a manner takes care of the editorial work before going into "project" mode is making the process become smooth. It is about designing a process whose outcome it is to produce well formed ideas. 
                - Formulating your ideas in terms of completed notes about a subject, with its dependencies mapped out, and a system that emerges from it.
                    - You can just focus on creating a small number of notes (which in this context is a self contained idea) per day and create an entirely prolific body of work, which not only is effective for organizing your thoughts  but in creating output that will then be expanded upon by the people that interact with it.
            - 11.2 Think Outside the Brain::
                - "When we take permanent notes, it is much more a form of thinking within the medium of writing and in dialogue with the already existing notes within the slip-box than a protocol of preconceived ideas. Any thought of a certain complexity requires writing. Coherent arguments require the language to be fixed, and only if something is written down is it fixed enough to be discussed independently from the author. The brain alone is too eager to make us feel good–even if it is by politely ignoring inconsistencies in our thinking. Only in the written form can an argument be looked at with a certain distance–literally. We need this distance to think about an argument–otherwise the argument itself would occupy the very mental resources we need for scrutinizing it."
                    - Writing a thought that we have goes beyond transcribing something in our heads to paper [No written piece is ever a copy of a thought in our mind](((tjWCJM6Cr))), it is a process of externalizing what we are thinking into a coherent, structured way.
                        - We can think that a thought makes sense, but verbalizing it actually reveals holes in our thought process.
                        - Our brain is excellent at tricking ourselves to forego reason (we tend to behave and think in logical fallacies) But we can do the hard work of revealing the weakness of an argument by putting it on paper and reading it as an outsider
                - "“Well,” the historian said, “the work was done in your head, but the record of it is still here.” “No, it’s not a record, not really. It’s working. You have to work on paper, and this is the paper.”[ 33]"
                    - Writing out your thoughts IS the thinking, not a byproduct of it
                - So we get to, once again, the point of the slip box. We want to connect it with our own work, our own motivations and draw the connections which will be most useful to us. The slip box is for things that are useful to us, and the questions that derive from that.
            - 11.3 Learn by not Trying::
                - Forgetting the details of something can be a useful tool for distilling the useful content out of it.
                - Storing information in our brain is about putting details in. Retrieving inforation is about making the relevant portion of those details stick, and that is most easily done through association with other areas.
                - "If we instead focus on “retrieval strength,” we instantly start to think strategically about what kind of cues should trigger the retrieval of a memory. There are no natural cues: Every piece of information can become the trigger for another piece of information. These can be associations like the scent of a sweet, as the madeleine triggered childhood memories for Proust, but this kind of flashback is called “involuntary memory” for a reason: we can’t retrieve it on purpose. Then there are the accidental cues that become attached to information when we learn something in a particular environment. It is, for example, easier to remember something we have learned in school if we are tested for it in the same room with the same noise in the background (Bjork 2011, 14). Likewise, sometimes it is difficult to remember something from school when we are not sitting in the classroom where we learned it."
                    - John Dewey talks about this extensively in [[Experience and Education]]. Experience is the basis for Dewey to reach any kind of learning. Learning actually is a collection of experiences. The problem with traditional education is that we are creating experiences that are completely abstracted from the context in which the information would be useful.
                        - We try to cram information into students as though students were recipients and information was an object. This is called transferism and is laughed at in pedagogical circles (and has been for a century)
                            - Yet this is still the operating model for education in my experience. Learn the information in a setting which is completely arbitrary, and have an experience of memorizing facts, which will only be useful for passing tests 
                                - "What does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes. Making these connections deliberately means building up a self-supporting network of interconnected ideas and facts that work reciprocally as cues for each other."
                                    - Goes back to the idea that every experience that we have (which in Dewey's case is equivalent to saying every idea that we have) has the possibility of creating new experiences (ideas). The experiences that lead to the greatest potential for future experiences, are the most valuable (the ideas that draw the most connections ot other, and to new ideas are the most useful)
                - So we understand by drawing meaningful connections (as memory artists do when creating these palaces for recalling different bits of data) and that is the process that we are trying to optimize for. 
                - If we were to design a process for creating meaningful, and thoughtful "knowledge work" you would have to start by identifying the process of learning, recalling, synthesizing 
        - [[Chapter 12. Develop Ideas]]  
            - notes in the slip box dont have to worry about completeness
            - completeness comes when a final manuscript is being worked on
            - we can also create an index for our permanent notes, but we should be thinking of it sparsely. The overview of the slib box is impossible to maintain in working memory.
the goal of the index is to draw one or two topics maximum to the idea talked about in  the slip box
relations between notes are more favorable to relations from index to notes

            - every attempt at creating an overview is also treated as a note and is subject to change
                - there is no primacy when considering the ontology of an overview note, the overview is still seen as a distinct idea.
                - this is thinking in terms of fractals where the whole and the details have the same importance
            - [[12.2 Make Smart Connections]]
                - Adding links to your notes works best if done in two directions
                - Drawing links between things will draw you attention connections that were not obvious prior
                - "It is important to always keep in mind that making these links is not a chore, a kind of file-box maintenance. The search for meaningful connections is a crucial part of the thinking process towards the finished manuscript. But here, it is dealt with in a very concrete way. Instead of figuratively searching our internal memory, we literally go through the file-box and look for connections. By dealing with actual notes, we are also less prone to imagine connections where there aren’t any, as we can see in black and white if something makes sense or not."
                    - We think through linking, it is not an end to itself, but a process at arriving at something new.[[Buckminster Fuller]] always drew the distinction between special case phenomena and generalized principles. Special cases are those things that we experience and our brain has an easy time differentiating. A generalized principle draws connections between the special cases, it is about relationships. These cannot be experienced directly by brain but must be arrived at through our mind's ability to create connections.
                - "As we are making these connections, we build up an internal structure of the slip-box, which is shaped by our thinking. While this structure builds up externally and independently of our limited memory, it will, in return, shape our thinking as well and help us to think in a more structured way. Our ideas will be rooted in a network of facts, thought-through ideas and verifiable references. The slip-box is like a well-informed but down-to-earth communication partner who keeps us grounded. If we try to feed it some lofty ideas, it will force us to check first: What is the reference? How does that connect to the facts and the ideas you already have?"
                    - Literature notes end up being sources of facts that live in our network of thoughts and ideas. We are not good at remembering the details of a fact, so the zettlekasten's role as a second brain really shines through here.
            - [[12.3 Compare, Correct and Differentiate]]
                - Thinking through a slip box is a way to arrive at how your thinking about something evolves. You end up finding that you have already written about something or that someone else thought it before you.
                    - The slip box can therefore point to the essence and the contradictions between a thing
                - "Comparing notes also helps us to detect contradictions, paradoxes or oppositions–important facilitators for insight. When we realise that we used to accept two contradicting ideas as equally true, we know that we have a problem–and problems are good because we now have something to solve. A paradox can be a sign that we haven’t thought thoroughly enough about a problem or, conversely, that we exhausted the possibilities of a certain paradigm. Finally, oppositions help to shape ideas by providing contrast. Albert Rothenberg suggests that the construction of oppositions is the most reliable way of generating new ideas (Rothenberg 1971; 1996; 2015)."
                    - This is the process of dialectics that Socrates and Plato, later Hegel and Marx based their process of arriving at truth, through opposition, you can arrive at something. Thesis Antithesis Synthesis
                - Because our brains are inneficient machines with a system of biases hardwired into their functioning, the slipbox is designed to facilitate us to do what we do best and watch our back when we are doing something stupid
            - [[12.4 Assemble a Toolbox for Thinking]]
                - "Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s partner and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, stresses the importance of having a broad theoretical toolbox–not to be a good academic, but to have a good, pragmatic grip on reality. He regularly explains to students which mental models have proven most useful to help him understand markets and human behaviour. He advocates looking out for the most powerful concepts in every discipline and to try to understand them so thoroughly that they become part of our thinking. The moment one starts to combine these mental models and attach one’s experiences to them, one cannot help but gain what he calls “worldly wisdom.” The importance is to have not just a few, but a broad range of mental models in your head. Otherwise, you risk becoming too attached to one or two and see only what fits them. You would become the man with a hammer who sees nails everywhere (cf. Maslow, 1966, 15)."
                    - Finding out about the most important concepts in different fields and trying to integrate that into your thinking as a strategy for broadening your horizons.
                    - Facts are useful, but they require models for them to be meaningful.
                        - Every model is necessarily a simplification of reality [[all models are false but some are useful]]
                - "A truly wise person is not someone who knows everything, but someone who is able to make sense of things by drawing from an extended resource of interpretation schemes. This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience. It is much better to learn from the experiences of others–especially when this experience is reflected on and turned into versatile “mental models” that can be used in different situations."
                    - [[John Dewey]] talks bout experience being the only way that learning actually happens in [[Experience and Education]]. This is a contradiction.
                        - Experience cannot be transferred from a person to another, but a model of the world can be communicated and applied towards new experiences. These models come from experience, and you can skip the mistakes by applying the derived model. 
                            - You can actually take a model and apply it to your interactions with the world, and verify through your own experience whether it proves to be useful or not. Take the [[bootstraping]] startup model, it is well defined. Do things that don't scale, get feedback early, launch before you are ready. These are all processes that have been borne out of the experiences of the people that have done this in the past. If you want to launch a self funded startup, it makes sense to follow this model, but the model remains an intellectual exercise until you go about actually doing the thing.
                - The process is made to think through the implications of new material in alignment with the way that we think, and the way that experts recommend us going about learning something.
            - [[12.5 Use the Slip - Box as a Creativity Machine]]
                - Creativity is the observing of how things are connected.
                - Ideas come from observation, and our embodied knowledge becomes intuition. This embodied knowledge comes from incremental revealing of patterns in our understanding over time
            - [[12.6 Think Inside the Box]]
                - To find new context for the ideas that we put into the box, we would have to find the abstract principle which an idea is outside of its context.
                - "Being able to abstract and re-specify ideas is, again, only one side of the equation. It is not good for anything if we don’t have a system in place that allows us to put this into practice. Here, it is the concrete standardization of notes in just one format that enables us to literally shuffle them around, to add one idea to multiple contexts and to compare and combine them in a creative way without losing sight of what they truly contain."
                    - By putting ideas exclusively into their distinct form, give them a distinct ontological status, they can then be remixed into different contexts
                - "One of the most famous figures to illustrate this skill is the mathematician Abraham Wald (Mangel and Samaniego 1984). During World War II, he was asked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that were most often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour. But instead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommended armouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits. The RAF forgot to take into account what was not there to see: All the planes that didn’t make it back."
                    - The obvious or apparent result is often the exact opposite of the correct thing.
            - [[12.7 Facilitate Creativity through Restrictions]]
                - relationship between creativity and limitations
                    - Having an empty canvas is sometimes seen as a good thing, but the sheer amount of possibilities is paralizing.
                        - Restricting the possibilities to a technique or a style actually makes the task manageable, and can create more creative solutions.
        - [[Chapter 13. Share Your Insight]]
            - On the process of writing, once the connections have been laid out and the work is in front of you, writing is organizing and threading the needle of the items in your slip box.

                - On the natural limitations of our brains. We have a program to prioritize a seemingly arbitrary set of habits rather than what might be important to remember in the future.
            - When starting to write, we should start from the ideas that we have already written about, not from generating a new idea. If we make a systematic effort to do so in the moment that they arise and not wait until we want to write about them, then we frontload our process of documenting ideas and make the process of writing much more seamless.
            - Ideas might die from lack of interest, or lack of relationships with other ideas.
                - [[graph theory]] nodes are defined by their relationships to the other nodes and their influence in the larger system

                    - Wandering is a step that can be taken to achieve creative output. Wading into the unknown makes sense as a strategy for new ideas, given that new ideas will by necessity be unknown.

                    - Read with a critical eye gauging, what is relevant about this to be worth the write up.
                        - It's about giving yourself the bandwidth to question if engaging with this is worth my time. [[Naval Ravikant]] often talks about starting far more books than he finishes, as life is too damn short to do things that are not inspiring or nurturing.
                - [[13.4 Finishing and Review]]
                    - Likewise, you should not write if it does not inspire you. You can start and work through multiple manuscripts, changing as your mind goes on to different ideas.
                        - Keeping a record of your thoughts allows you to only work on what is interesting to you at the time.
                - [[13.5 Becoming an Expert by Giving up Planning]]
                    - We tend to plan things out and vastly underestimate the time it will take us to complete something.(Buehler, Griffin, and Ross 1995) Overconfidence bias
                    - According to the famous law of Parkinson, every kind of work tends to fill the time we set aside for it, like air fills every corner of a room (Parkinson 1957).

        - [[Chapter 14. Make it a Habit]]
            - We tend to only align our intentions wiyh our behavior if we already have the habit of behaving in that way previous to setting the intentions.
    - [[Afterword]]
- Fleeting Notes:: 
    - "You can type a literature note directly into Zotero, where it will be stored with the bibliographic details. You might want to write them by hand, though. Different independent studies indicate that writing by hand facilitates understanding. In a small but fascinating study, two psychologists tried to find out if it made a difference if students in a lecture took notes by hand or by typing them into their laptops (Mueller and Oppenheimer 2014). They were not able to find any difference in terms of the number of facts the students were able to remember. But in terms of understanding the content of the lecture, the students who took their notes by hand came out much, much better. After a week, this difference in understanding was still clearly measurable."
        - I have heard about this study often, and I always wonder, just how much of it has to do with the tools. It seems like a few reasons could be culprit. The fact that the screen is distracting. The fact that typing is faster and takes less cognitive capacity to just transcribe rather than synthesize. In the end,however, writing by pencil is just as arbitrary as writing in a computer from an evolutionary perspective. A computer, however, provides many more affordances that  a pen and paper could never provide you. Roam is an excellent example of this. 
            - My thought is basically that the reason why it is innefective has more to do with not taking advantage of the tools that we use for notetaking rather than the fact that it is a screen or whatever
    - [[Goals for Book Club]] [[Goals for Book Club]]

- Literature Notes::
    - Luhman managed to externalize and systematize part of his processing beyond himself, to extend his capability beyond its natural limitations, and encourage the type of conclusion drawing that is necessary for domain insights 
    - The system allows for the way which we naturally write content about a specific topic to be baked into the process of creating notes for it. It is frontloading the effort to the point where it has the  least friction.
        - The next step is really interesting, as the suggestion is for an order to emerge naturally rather than synthetically. Topics, areas and ideas for written work should not be forced, but will reveal themselves as the network becomes larger. 
    - At the core of the argument is an idea about why we read and write, and how we can use that to produce something valuable from it. Reading is not just acquiring information [( 1 )](((bTl37ljSz))) but the goal of reading, researching, writing, and publishing is to garner something valuable from that process.
