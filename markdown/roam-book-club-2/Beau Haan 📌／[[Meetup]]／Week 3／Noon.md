- # Example
    - ### Source
        - A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.
        - "Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."
        - The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.
        - Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.
        - "You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse. "Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion."

                - There's a danger involved with all of life, and if we can find the allies through differences then there remains the hope of surviving another day
                - Having consideration for others provides not only humility but also the opportunity for authentic kindness
                - The more than I understand the text or source the more I can write, but then because they are ALL underneath as a child block, they will show when searching for Literature Notes
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] There is strength in numbers only if there is a realization of consideration to appreciate the differences
                - This reminds me of stereotypes and how being judgmental of someone or something can be a huge loss especially when you need it the most
                - I'm also thinking about how everyone has a purpose and everyone has a strength, if only we are open-minded enough to appreciate our differences
                - I also think about community, and how when we can understand that not one of us will have all of the answers, but it is when we come together, weakness and strength, do we flee the arms of the sum of all our fears

            - thinking about growth vs. fixed mindset - how impatient I get with process-focused people, but how critical their approach is to certain tasks

            - [[Lion and Mouse]] Story of a small weak person shown mercy by a greater person and then in a surprising twist, returning the favor.
                - Written no doubt by a guy who perceived himself to be the lion.
                    - It strikes me that the more logical solution for the mouse might have been not to intervene, since it was only the lion's amusement that had saved her life. 
                - But yeah, the small can help the great. 
                    - If you believe in a world with small and great people.
                - What happens in absence of Deus ex machina (the hunter's trap)?

    5. [[Wade Dominic]]
        - #[[Literature Notes]] Regardless of current strength of a position the default mode of kindness is always the better decision to take. As there may come a time when the position of strength is reversed and the kindness is returned to you.
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This reminds me of playing to each others strengths
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Paying forward with kindness returns in unexpected ways

                    - Question your judgments.
                    - The principle of reciprocity: if I give you something of value, you give me something of value in return. If I fail to do this continually, then I won't receive things of value from you anymore.
                        - Reciprocity is seen in nature as well as most human interactions.
                        - #Question   Is it cynical to look at all human interactions in terms of reciprocity?

                            - Whether or not you survive an encounter with a lion may depend on how hungry the lion is.
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]]The lion shares the same intestinal flora as humans. 
                - As we co-evolved with lions, we were often on the menu. 
                    - A predator eats the intestines first because that is the most nutritious part of the animal.
