    - [[Introduction]]
        - Guidance written is targeted toward the end of the writing process and generally ignores the note-taking that is foundational. 
        - Writing good notes and organizing them well makes a big difference in the quality of your finished piece.
        - Note-taking doesn't get much attention, in part because we don't get feedback about it.
        - "The right question is: What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily?" [[How to Take Smart Notes--quotes]]
        - Good writing is based on good note-taking (bulk of preparatory work--the thinking--is already done).
        - Most important indicator of academic success is in their habits--how they approach doing work with discipline. 
        - Self-discipline and self-control have more to do with our environment, which can be changed. 
            - "Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway." [[How to Take Smart Notes--quotes]]
        - Avoid having to use willpower instead of focusing on how to muster it up.
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - Having a strong system removes the distraction and mental burden of keeping track of logistics, frees energy to focus on ideas.
            - "A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas." [[How to Take Smart Notes--quotes]]
        - Writer's block may be more because our thoughts are not organized or easily retrievable to make connections.
        - When you make a plan you impose a structure upon yourself that makes you inflexible. Sticking to a plan is not suitable for open-ended processes like research where it's helpful to keep open to new insights and discoveries. 
            - "The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward."
        - Dunning-Kruger effect: poor students feel more successful because they experience less self-doubt. They don't know how much they don't know, e.g. Donald Trump.
        - High achievers tend to experience imposter syndrome because they know there's a lot they don't know. 
        - The problem posed by gathering more notes is that it's more complex to organize and make findable later. Sorting into categories can prevent one from making connections with other fields or subjects. 
        - No need to play catch up with previous notes.
            - "It is not about redoing what you have done before, but about changing the way of working from now on. There is really no need to reorganise anything you already have. Just deal with things differently the moment you have to deal with them anyway."
        - Two ideas: 1) slip-box technique; 2) change daily routines
            - "Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly (cf. Mata, Todd, and Lippke, 2010). Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place [...]". #habits
        - Reference to __Getting Things Done__ by David Allen and the principle of collecting everything in one place and processing systematically.
    - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
        - Make fleeting notes--just rough capture of things that pop out of the text. 
        - Make literature notes--about content, what you want to remember for later. Be selective with quotes and don't copy instead of translating into your own words. Note bibliographic details.
        - Make permanent notes. Go through fleeting notes and literature notes as soon as possible and make connections to what is relevant for your own thinking. Idea is to develop ideas not just collect them. How does new information relate to existing slip box content?
        - Write complete sentences, make references, be as clear and concise as possible.
            - Is reference system separate from slip box?
        - File new permanent notes behind related notes, or else just behind the last one. Link to index?
        - Develop research questions and topics from content in slip box. What is there, what is missing, what questions does it prompt? Follow your interest.
