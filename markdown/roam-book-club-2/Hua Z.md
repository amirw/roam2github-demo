    - I'm a Ph.D. student working on paper reading and relative studies. I'm looking forward to learning and applying ZettelKasten methods to my study. And find the best practice for implementing ZettelKasten methods with Roam 
- How to Take Smart Notes::
    - [[Introduction]]
        - what you do before the writing - preparing for the writing is more important in practice
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - principle idea of GTD：if we know all other things will be taken good care of, then we could concentrate ourselves on the current undergoing things.
        - what we need is a small, flexible note-taking system while captures our insights
        - the Slop-box Niklas Luhmann 
            - Two boxes
                - “Strictly speaking, Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read. The notes were written on index cards and stored in wooden boxes.”
                - 
            - Achieve references
                - “Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box.”
    - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
        - Step 1. **Make fleeting notes**. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. Don’t worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on. These are fleeting notes, mere reminders of what is in your head. They should not cause any distraction. Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later.”
            - one box for ideas random ideas, one # for indicator all the ideas and the remark notes during the paper reading notes 
        - Step 2. **Make literature notes**. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don’t want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing. Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words. Be extra selective with quotes – don’t copy them to skip the step of really understanding what they mean. Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place – your reference system”
        - Step 3. **Make Permanent Notes**. Revisit the fleetings and literature notes (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) & create connections and new ideas, finish the writing with your own words. 
    - [[Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have]]
        - write your notes here 
    - [[Chapter 4. A Few Things to Keep in Mind]]
        - you don’t want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing. ^^Keep it very short, be extremely selective,^^ and use your own words. Be extra selective with quotes – don’t copy them to skip the step of really understanding what they mean. Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place – your reference system.

        - Relative Roam realizations
            - "Two boxes" - two workloads: one for references and other one is for writing and thinking 
            - "Achieve references" - **bullet notes** like ^^reading notes^^ taking system with references
                - How for paper reading notes or course learning notes?
    - Recording notes under topics vs metierals
        - (Working like this will leave you with a lot of different notes in many different places. Writing, then, means to rely heavily on your brain to remember where and when these notes were written down. A text must then be conceptualised independently from these notes, which explains why so many resort to brainstorming to arrange the resources afterwards according to this preconceived idea)
