    - [[Introduction]]
        - "Luckily, this is not the whole story. We know today that self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed. Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long-and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play."
            - To often we punish ourselves for not having the willpower to maintain self-control.  I'm not strong enough.  I'm not good enough.  These thoughts self-doubt can paralyze you - and yet we forget that the environment plays a significant factor. By learning how to modify your environment, so that it removes obstacles that might demand willpower, you are setting yourself up to success.  In the end, the trick to success is based on how well you preserve your limited amount of willpower.
                - If you want to kick a shopping addiction, move to a town outside the capital of Laos.  With language barriers, different viewpoints of customer services, limited postal services and challenging transportation and shipping hurdles, every purchase is like a scavenger hunt.  While this can be exciting for the first month or so, shopping quickly looses its appeal.  Shopping behavior shifts from searching for things - and being disappointed, to taking on a "Bo pen yeung" attitude which essentially means "don't mind".  
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - ""A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas. By breaking down the amorphous task of “writing a paper” into small and clearly separated tasks, you can focus on one thing at a time, complete each in one go and move on to the next one (Chapter 3.1). A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). Something like that does not happen by chance.""
            - I know and trust that the sun will rise and set every day.  With that structure, I have routines that I follow - routines that do not require thought, which means I can focus on more important tasks.
            - While our minds are powerful, they have limitations.  Help your mind focus on important tasks by sticking to a structure that is trustworthy.  
                - By doing so, you can welcome flow into your work routines - effortlessly
        - "With that in mind, it is not surprising that the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people’s heads, but in the way they do their everyday work. In fact, there is no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success–at least not north of 120. Yes, a certain intellectual capacity helps to get into academia, and if you struggle severely with an IQ test, it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems, too. But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure. What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004)."
            - In this digital age, teaching students of all ages how build a  supportive structure that supports self-discipline to learn is critical.  The addictive features of social media and unlimited access to an overwhelming amount of information - of varying levels of quality - can quickly create a spiral of distraction.  
                - What are tricks to avoid the spiral of distraction?  Is a workflow and trusted structure all that is needed?  
        - "Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven’t learned and mastered yet. This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are (Clance and Imes 1978; Brems et al. 1994). This book is for you, the good students, ambitious academics and curious nonfiction writers who understand that insight doesn’t come easy and that writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing."
            - The reality that a high achiever can suffer from imposter syndrome, doubting their own capabilities, can have disabling effects on someone's career if they remain unaware of imposter syndrome.  
                - Aside from knowing imposter syndrome exists, what strategies can one take to overcome or live in harmony with it?
            - So you think you are not good enough for that next assignment?  Good news.  Should you be suffering from a case of imposter syndrome, you might be more prepared then you think! Try.
            - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez once sympathized with her many followers, expressing that she too would sometimes experience imposter syndrome.

        - "The importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of [[David Allen]]’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001). There are few serious knowledge workers left who haven’t heard of “GTD” and that is for a good reason: It works. The principle of [[GTD]] is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended to do, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture. Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water”-the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. The principle is simple but holistic. It is not a quick fix or a fancy tool. It doesn’t do the work for you. But it does provide a structure for our everyday work that deals with the fact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds."
            - Keep in mind that the GTD approach is successful because it helps moving thoughts out of our working memory and captures them in a standardized, simple, system.  While breaking work down into smaller bite-size pieces, and seeing everything in one location, you can then make decisions on what is important and worth prioritizing. 
            - GTD creates a structure that helps remove distractions that come from our minds.
            - The point about distractions coming from our own mind reminds me of my vipassana meditation.  There seems to be similarities here - importance of sticking to a routine, following a structure (ayapana, sensations) - but what I like most of meditation is how we try to teach ourselves to simply smile if we notice a wondering mind.  
        - "What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent. Even the best tools won’t make much of a difference if they are used in isolation. Only if they are embedded in a well-conceived working process can the tools play out their strengths. There is no point in having great tools if they don’t fit together."
            - The holistic perspective brings me back to the primary health care program in Laos and the community work done to curb the stunting rates.  Something like nutrition cannot be solved in isolation - instead it requires commitments from multiple stakeholders from agriculture, to health, to water and sanitation, to governance, to livelihoods.  
                - While I appreciate a holistic perspective, I recognize that we can become overwhelmed with the thought of changing so many challenges to overcome.  This is the importance of partnership.  
                    - So in the case of notetaking, if I cannot control all of the factors that influence my success in setting up a routine and system, I may need to find partners - such as this book club - to help provide advice, guidance, and most importantly - support and motivation. 
        - "The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. It is in the nature of writing, especially insight-oriented writing, that questions change, the material we work with turns out to be very different from the one imagined or that new ideas emerge, which might change our whole perspective on what we do. Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned–which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work."
            - Do not stop at the first idea!  This warning was also expressed in my Fostering Creative Thinking course - warning leaders to come up several options to consider.
                - Go back to course content to extract ideas linked to decision making, the power of options.

- [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
    - [[Goals for Book Club]] In 4 weeks I will be comfortable navigating Roam, taking steps to introduce a routine of note-taking into my weekly schedule, and to apply concepts such as fleeting notes, permanent notes.
    - Question: Q:  In what scenarios would we ever choose to connect items from our hosted graph, with the roam-book-club-2 graph (or connect different graphs together ever)
        - Per Matt Brockwell, "for now direct link-to-link contact between graphs doesn’t really exist (though it might) but I often write in group graph for export to individual, or vice versa" and "esc-key to select a HUGE portion of graph and copy it? Very useful for porting large segments of graph"
            - Yes, if you hit “esc” it selects a block and ALL of its children to the nth generation - you can then copy and paste a HUGE chunk of notes, as long as they are all under that one node
        - Nico Macdonald had a similar question and need.
            - That may be a question for Matt or someone from the Roam support team to answer, but from my understanding the ability to connect graphs is being actively considered. For now, you can just use a URL, though quite limited.
            - Do message me via @Nico_Macdonald if you want more advice.
        - Hypothes.is
            - used by Ronaldo da Silva Alves Batista, Jeremie Rykner says it can sync with readwise to roam now", Matthew Vogel highly recommends it,

- [[Writing Prompts]]
    - "How would you describe a [[Zettelkasten]] to a 5-year old?"
    - "It's the end of November. What's different to today about your reading and writing?"
"What does it mean to elaborate on something you've read? What sort of elaboration techniques work best while reading?"
- [[Book Club Live Session 3]]
    - "How do you take literature notes? Discuss your method."
        - Currently I use Zotero to capture both bibliography details of articles read and literature notes. 
    - "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?"
        - While I use Zotero to capture majority of my literature notes (I am new to Roam), I found Zotero platform to be less practical for items such as interviews.  
        - In addition, I notice myself getting excited while taking literature notes - and including insight and connections to other ideas.  This means the literature notes are a combination of literature notes + questions + insight.  
        - I am also frustrated that so much of my content still sits in Zotero - outside of Roam.  I need to think of ways to begin migrating content over in a systematic way.
    - "Describe any enlightening moments you had while taking literature notes."
        - My first literature notes were filled with highlights - as if everything in an article was important.  However as I am more mindful of taking literature notes, what I extract is becomes more selective.  
    - [*Don't fool yourself.  Behavior change takes time. ](((x5hx3y9ay)))
        - Don't fool yourself.  Behavior change takes time.   
- [[Book Club Live Session 5]]
    - [[Writing practice]]
        - "Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month. "
            - Since reading the book, and learning how to use Roam, I have discovered a new approach to learning, reading, and writing - one that energizes me, and encourages me to capture and record what resonates most with me.  In addition, I am trying to be more conscious of my outputs - to stop just consuming and storing of information but going to the next phase of analyzing, converting, and sharing new insight.  
        - "Reflect on your Zettel process"
            - Thanks to Beau's patient support and coaching session, as of yesterday I feel my Zettle awareness process has exploded - propelling me know in a better, more focused direction.  What I will likely do next is go back to previously read articles to see how I can apply what I learned with Beau, and update what I thought were fleeting an literature notes before. 
        - ""Reflect on your Zettel process""
            - I want a trusted dialogue buddy - one that helps me navigate my many past experiences and readings so that I can make sense of this world and the people within it.  Oh what a tricky world it is... 
    - Breakout session, I met [[Carolina Brum]]
    - [[spaced repetition]], from Matt Brockwell.  He shares resources
        Anki-style recongizes that you once knew something, and may simply need a refresher - instead of resetting the process review cycle from start.
