    - [[Goals for Book Club]]
        - I want notetaking to become sort of a second nature. But I want to do this in a way I feel comfortable with. I've read the book but I find it difficult to implement it.
        - A secondary goal is for me to become more familiar with Roam. This is an outstanding opportunity to kill 2 birds with one stone.
        - Can I let go of thinking in structures? I can't help myself but I'm always thinking about ways to do the things better or even perfect. This stops me from even taking notes because I'm thinking I'm not saving it at the right place or something
        - Furthermore it will help me with my English because this is not my first language.
        - It was good to hear from [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] that sometimes it's ok to just read. Notes might come in a later stage. Keep this in mind. It might help to keep reading!
        - I want to consistently add personal insights to my notes and not just adding highlights. What will this bring me?
        - I've read a lot already but I've forgotten a lot to. Will this way help me remember and or implement the knowledge better?
        - I want to learn from others. See and hear their insights and workflow.
