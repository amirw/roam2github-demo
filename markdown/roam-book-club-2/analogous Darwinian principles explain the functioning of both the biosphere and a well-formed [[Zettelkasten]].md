        - If we, on the other hand, let questions arise from the slip-box, we know that they are tried and tested among dozens or even hundreds of other possible questions. The vast majority of questions might have been answered quickly or disappeared as no notes were drawn to them, either because of a lack of interest or a lack of material. This is how evolution works: by trial and error, not planning

- notes::
    - instantiations of this general principle include:
        - [[the more entities that exist in a space (e.g., the biosphere, a [[Zettelkasten]]) the more opportunities there are for novel combinations upon which selection can act]]
        - [[an evolutionary explanation requires variation, inheritance, and selection]]
            - [[the evolutionary requirement of variation is satisfied in a [[Zettelkasten]] when simple ideas connect to form a novel combination]]
            - [[the evolutionary requirement of selection is satisfied in a [[Zettelkasten]] when the writer selects one lower-level simpler idea to form a complex idea and rejects other lower-level simpler ideas]]
            - [[the evolutionary requirement of heritability is satisfied in a [[Zettelkasten]] when a complex idea is formed by inheriting lower-level simpler ideas]]
    - But, the analogy breaks down when it comes to intellectual property:
        - [[Ogle. Smart World. the difference between the biosphere and a [[Zettelkasten]] network of ideas is that the use of an idea by one person leaves as much and as good for everyone else]]
