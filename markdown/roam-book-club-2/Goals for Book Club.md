- Learn how to use Roam for myself 
- Explore the idea of the slipbox as a way of creating permanent notes 
- Develop a better system for writing longer content (that I plan to publish)
- Develop a better system for note-taking from various content (books, youtube, podcasts, etc.)
    - A written process with clear steps
- To learn the Smart Notes / Zettelkasten system at the same time as I'm  learning Roam. The end point is to be good enough at using Roam that I can efficiently and effectively apply it to Smart Notes and to be good enough at Smart Notes to be able to efficiently and effectively apply it to Roam.
- "Find tools for refining my own system of learning and writing"
- "Have a better system for my writing, which currently include talks/speeches and blog posts"
- "Consider how note taking on "knowledge" fits in with note taking on "life" (eg, recipes, random bookmarks, important details of lease, etc.)"
- "Refine the connection between my existing "life" systems - my to-do lists, personal project management, and tracking the information I need to exist in society, and my "knowledge" system, which is still being actively developed and is starting initially strongly informed by Luhmenn's and Ahren's writings."

- The collective writing may be interesting to get something started with my students.
- Engage with a great community of notetakers.
