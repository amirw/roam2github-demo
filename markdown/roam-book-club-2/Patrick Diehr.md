- [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
    - [[[[Goals of Book Club]]]]
        - Meet some new people
        - Read and understand how others are interpreting the book
        - See how others are using roam and see if I find inspiration in any of their methods
        - Improve my writing abilities
        - Think about the pros/cons of collective thought - what are the other applications for Roam in multiplayer?
            - what things are technological issues that are holding parts of the group back?
            - what are inherent limitations to the group's work?
                - I think this may be better in small groups? 
                    - Jim talked about how he started a multiplayer experience with his investment club
        - See the types of internal questions that people have while they read
            - This is something that I hope to develop and improve over time
    - [[After Action Report]]
        - I thought the first session was interesting and was good getting to meet a few new people even if it was brief.
        - It was interesting to hear Sonke talk about how the book came to be and how he thinks about roam and aspects of collective thought.
        - I think a lot of people are struggling as Roam is something new to them so we will see how many people will come to future sessions. I hope that they can bridge the gap and we can support those people who are just starting.

- [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] Notes
    - There is not a perfect daily system
        - Thing are flexible so do not expect everything to be a hard and fast rule
    - There is a good element to the personal thought process vs a collective thought process
