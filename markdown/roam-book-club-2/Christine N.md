            - [[In seeking truth, writing should be both the means and the end]] 
            - #[[Literature Notes]] 
                - Writing is both the means (note-taking) AND the end (final output e.g. manuscript, book etc)
                - [the slip-box inverts the top down approach where writing is considered separate from other tasks like thinking or reading & given much more importance as the final keystone or "main event” when in fact writing should be present at all stages, even before we come up with a good question](((U0_AKhDHt)))
                - [Constantly writing also improves your other intellectual skills for the better as a by-effect](((9LdD6VzxA)))  
                    - increased efficiency when listening to information
                        - how would i be more efficient? because i'm listening with a goal in mind, i'm taking lit notes as i'm listening?
                    - ability to identify good arguments
                    - more focus and engagement when reading which means you will elaborate on the meaning, understanding leads to remembering -> turning knowledge into something else
                    - maybe would need to flesh out how for each of these
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] 
            - To think further about the Zettel process in Roam 
                - a little time consuming to copy and paste all other books the way it's been done for Sonke Ahrens directly into Roam - faster way? Text format available to just dump into Roam?
                - how to indicate a comment directly on a single sentence within a block? it feels a bit limiting to just ref huge blocks rn
                - prog summing the original 
        - [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
            - #[[Literature Notes]] 
                - History shows that there is great, underestimated power in simplicity. One change in routine/organisation has transformative/revolutionary potential.
                    - Henry Ford (car to the worker instead of workers to the car)
                    - NASA vs Russia on writing in space - NASA overcomplicated the solution i.e. a pressurised pen - the solution seemed to expand to fit their budget
                    - [McLean & the shipping container](((cfebc0ULz))) - actually still don't get what happened here lol
                - In the case of the slip-box, quality individual notes mingling with & relating to each other over time builds **critical mass**
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                - perhaps - your success is dependent on the simplicity of your system
                - keep it simple, stupid
                - Don't fight your tools
                - [Put more emphasis into strategies for retrieval than storage](((qjApgS0oM)))
        - [[Chapter 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch]]
            - [[a daunting and monumental task can become manageable if we routinely chip at it]]
            - #[[Literature Notes]]
                - the slip-box can become a deep well from which we can draw ideas if we routinely contribute to it every day 
                - success is due less to genius than to a system of small habits which, executed every day, leads to compounded returns
                    - this is repeated again next chapter
                    - "It is not so important who you are , but what you do." (p4)
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                - We can underestimate the power of the banal & the routine in our everyday to build up to great work.
                - ~~Great things are built from tiny; great comes from ~~~~small;  ~~~~great things come from small~~
                - Even the greatest of creations starts from the single, humble building block
                - A monument started with a brick, a story with a letter, a powerful speech from a word. (more than the sum of parts type thing). Similarly, if notes are the building blocks of writing, shouldn’t we make sure the way we design and organise them is strong to be assured the entire resulting structure (article, thesis, dissertation) is sound? ... "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"
                    - "Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note. "
        - [[Chapter 8. Let the Work Carry You Forward]]
            - [[The key factor to motivation is finding inherent reward in your work]]
            - [[Work becomes play as concentrated expertise is freely expressed.]] - really like this
            - #[[Literature Notes]] 
                - Successful people do not rely on willpower to practice rather rely on a holistic system and process, and have a growth mindset
                    - wise use of **powerful tools linked/embedded in a seamless, holistic, overarching, interlocked workflow/process** - to become daily routines, working habits, structure RATHER THAN an exertion of will to overcome resistance or use of those same, powerful tools in isolation (p9) (app://obsidian.md/productivity)
                        - interlocked workflow **=** routine OR workflow **enables** routine??
                        - are they **automatic** because they are embedded in an overarching workflow? isn't the very definition of habits are automatic tasks
                    - growth mindset, i.e. getting progressively better at something is inherently rewarding. the most reliable long - term **growth strategy** is seeking as many opportunities to learn as possible (p53)
                    - a **learning system** which embeds** **[feedback loops](app://obsidian.md/feedback%20loops) (in this case it’s note-taking i.e. paraphrasing, translating, elaborating to test our understanding of a text) (p53)
                        - the very process of attempting and failing encourages the building of long-term memory (section 10.5, p88)
                        - what’s the difference between this the interlocked process mentioned first point?
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                - Other summaries: 
                    - the slip-box creates the internal **momentum** towards long-term learning and success i.e. the work itself (putting notes into the slip-box) is the source of our motivation and not dependent on short-term external rewards to complete
                    - the slip box promotes a self-sustaining/self-regulating cycle of motivation by creating a "virtuous circle" of learning. this is critical to long-term learning & personal success …
                    - the slip-box taps into the dynamics of motivation i.e **the work itself **(putting notes into the slip-box) - **is the source of our motivation** and not dependent on short-term external rewards to complete.
                    - so writing using the slip-box helps creates its own momentum
                - the slip box contains **inner connectedness** (lines of developed thought) & **complexity** thoughts can relate to each other in unexpected ways - helping you become worldly-wise
                    - i like this description but i feel like it doesn’t belong here - where does it belong instead?
    - [[The Six Steps to Successful Writing]]
        - [[Chapter 9. Separate the Interlocking Tasks]]
            - #[[Literature Notes]] Step 1) the slip-box is an organisational structure that accommodates for different steps of the writing process as required - allows us to focus attention, check understanding by engaging in embedded feedback loops, giving room for our brains to think rather than remember
                - the slip-box's clear working structure helps train our **attention** by preventing multi-tasking - this frees us to be **chaotic** with the learning process i.e. free to follow your interests & whims, greater flexibility with different - sometimes opposing - types of attention required for different creative tasks
                    - 9.1 "give each task your undivided attention"
                    - 9.2 "multi-tasking is not a good idea"
                    - 9.3 - "give each task the right kind of attention”
                - later, when you've built up a significant idea cluster accumulates, you can gather it all together and switch to **ordered** and analytical working process
                - the slip-box embeds **feedback loops** & promotes deliberate practice through **interconnected writing tasks.** this is essential to acquiring expertise (defined as deep inernalised knowledge & embodied experience that manifests as intuitive decision-making)
                    - section 9.4 - "become an expert instead of a planner”
                -  the slip-box is a reliable space to combat the Zeigarnik effect by externalising any open loops (unresolved tasks or questions) through the act of writing them down and trusting that we’ll be able to retrieve them later. alleviating the burden of remembering from the brain and leaves it free to fulfil its purpose - to roam, be creative, solve problems (NOTE: we can also use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage by deliberately choosing to keep certain problems in our minds to solve them unconsciously while doing casual or unrelated tasks)
                    - section 9.5 "get closure”
                - the slip-box uses **standardised** features which helps maintain your **ego reserves** by decreasing the need to make unnecessary decisions and allows for crucial breaks
                    - from section 9.6 - "reduce the number of decisions”
                    - [be aware of ego depletion](((IsHsEHJwf)))
                    - [be consistent with your organisational system & tools](((gdS3acyLy)))
                        - use the same notebook for making quick notes
                        - extracting the main ideas from a text in the same way
                        - turning them into the same kind of permanent notes , which are always dealt with in the same manner
                    - [by using reliable tools, we can take breaks from work - these are crucial to recovering your ego reserves and the learning process by giving brain space to process and move new information into long term memory](((LhfTAVsR5)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                - feel like a lot of this section is quoting rather than translating in my own words cos, damn, some of these are choice words and phrases 
                - still don't get what the point of this chapter is and how the points below fit together under this one chapter lol
                - don't think Ahrens explains what interlocking and separate means - or at least makes it explicit
                - Elisa said July 11th, 2020 about the relationship "as an expression of duality: **chaos** (brain) - **order** (zettlekasten)"
                - section 9.4
                    - i’m not sure i’m seeing the connection between feedback loops and expertise - think i need to make this more explicit
                    - find out more about the study where they classified mastery into different levels (level 5 = expert, level 4 = master, level 3 = performer - lvl 3, correctly applies teachable rules)
                        - wonder how that study defined mastery?
                        - is this similar to "muscle memory"?
                    - is ahrens using "interconnection" interchangeably with 'interlocked’? - shit so many “inter"s
                    - how are the writing tasks interlocked?? which writing tasks are interlocked? is he referring to the note taking, so writing a note every time you encounter something interesting, and dissolving it into the slip box?
                - section 9.5 - reminds me of GTD system - boy was it helpful
                - section 9.6 
                    - Cal Newport, deep work and boring breaks

                - possible zettel: you must write to read smart

            - #[[Literature Notes]]
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                - possible zettel: you must write to learn smart
        - [[Chapter 12. Develop Ideas]]  
            - #[[Literature Notes]] Step 4) develop insight by consistently taking precise, succinct, linked notes using the slip-box & also consciously disrupting your own thought & observational patterns
                - nsight is not found but developed **organically**, consistently and over time ... compounding effects
                - to develop insight you need a system for learning & thinking - in this case, the slip-box for note-taking
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
        - [[Chapter 13. Share Your Insight]]
            - #[[Literature Notes]] Step 5) Use of the slip-box over time will evolve and indicate our best ideas and questions over time to ultimately share with others
                - When you start writing to publish, your approach __should__ be linear to develop the arguments present in your slip-box, filling the gaps, cutting out what's irrelevant.
                - with the slip box we can experiment with ideas, facilitate a process of natural selection where the **the fittest ideas are the ones that evolve & survive** i.e. note clusters that organically accumulate content and information signals personally interesting & relevant questions
                - brainstorming is a technique that is generally believed to promote creativity but actually parallels the dated view of education & learning as rote - where all the answers are assumed to be already in our heads. the strategy does not account for the natural biases & tendencies of the brain that work __against__ generating innovation & insight
                    - [the most readily available ideas are probably not the most original - the brain latches onto recent encounters, emotionally coloured, concrete & specific ideas rather than abstract and vague one](((TNZTnyXIC)))
                    - [we tend to like our first ideas, even if irrelevant ](((hPc8a-oN6)))
                - because good questions naturally arise from the slip-box, this means they are already "embedded" in content-rich context, already present with the material needed to turn it into something share-able
                - engaging with the slip-box system forces us to go from **THINKING to DOING **(taking smart notes about those ideas) the slip-box is a practical way to **engage with ideas** 
                    - [dem feedback loops](((nijGB1zC-)))
                - elaboration when writing notes for the slip-box leads to more open-mindedness - increased familiarity with a problem heightens awareness of current limitations, leads to experimentation, then finally insight (our end goal) - recognition of the truly novel. the system is a way to deliberately practice rather than assuming the virtue of open-mindedness
                    - 
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                - Step 5 - share generated ideas & insight to the public
                - the process of idea evolution brings to mind Naval's interview with Matt Ridley ... i see a little more why and how evolution & natural selection is so fundamental to him. natural selection also applies to ideas
                - using our slip-box is already based on the presumption that ideas come from outside of us, external to us
                    - the process of experimentation/trial & error, **evolving ideas** and **bubbling up good questions to the surface**, using the power of sheer numbers (trying more ideas means we're likely to find something of actual value)
                    - the process is self-reinforcing - actually don't know what he means by this
        - [[Chapter 14. Make it a Habit]]
            - [[slowly ease into replacing bad habits with good ones by taking the first smallest actionable step ]]
                - #[[Literature Notes]] 
                    - the very familiarity of a habit skews our perception of future self-control 
                        - "familiarity breeds contempt"
                        - other attempts to summarise this point
                            - ~~we underestimate how much the familiarity of a habit influences our control over our intentions~~
                            - because of its familiarity, we underestimate how much a force of habit actually influences our own control over our intentions
                            - because of familiarity, we underestimate how much a habit influences our future self-control
                            - the very familiarity of a habit colours (feel like this isn't enough of a negative word) our perception of self-control over future actions
                            - similar to the [mere exposure effect](app://obsidian.md/mere%20exposure%20effect), we have less control than we think over our habits, including the bad ones,
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    -  start slow - first just make the effort to record the most important or personally interesting parts of source material while reading - then soon enough you'll progress to making literature notes
                    - other summaries of the chapter
                        - consciously make the effort & time to establish note-writing as a good habit
                        - consciously & consistently practice note-writing - i.e. keep taking notes
                    - **habits** (operations we repeatedly perform without thinking) —largely influences —> **intention** (what we do in the immediate future)
                        - **familiarity** of an action affects our judgement/perception/“intuitive expectations” of our control over that action **mere exposure effect** i.e. we have less control than we think over an action we repeatedly perform
                        - is intention like the ego he talked about? 
                    - don’t muscle out the bad habits, slowly replace them with new habits, take the time to establish good routines. 
                        - in terms of the slip-box, this is writing ideas with pen and paper, translating them into permanent notes to enforce that **virtuous circle of learning**
                        - acknowledgement and awareness of the dark sides of our natural tendencies is the first step to overcoming them
