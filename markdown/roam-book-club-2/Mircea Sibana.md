    - "To sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic. But if that is true (and I wholeheartedly believe it is), and the key to successful writing lies in the preparation, it also means that the vast majority of self-help books and study guides can only help you to close the barn door correctly and according to official rulesâ€“not just a moment, but many months after the horse has already escaped.")
        - I resonate that "the key to successful writing lies in the preparation". But how does the preparation works for me?
    - If I want to be a better [[Writer]], I have to pass the better reader stage and evolve to a better note-taking stage, better evergreen collector. 
The writing success lies in the success of self-discipline and self-control and all these are developed on [[values]], [[purpose]] and deliberate [[habbit]]s [*](((KqvBsDubC)))
    - "It is not so important who you are, but what you do. Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, to success. At first glance, this is both good and bad news. The good news is that we wouldn't be able to do much about our IQ anyway, while it seems to be within our control to have more self-discipline with a little bit of willpower. The bad news is that we do not have this kind of control over ourselves. Self-discipline or self-control is no that easy to achieve with willpower alone. Willpower is, as far as we know today, a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term (Baumester, Bratslavsky, 1998; Schmeichel, Vohs, and Boumeister, 2003; Moller, 2006). And who would want to flog oneself to work, anyway?"
        - So the not only the [[self-discipline]] and [[self-control]] are a limited resource when based on [[willpower]], but it is also advisable to not trust this process for long term improvement. Here the values and purpose are coming in place.
        - A I see it, the [[willpower]] is like someone throws you to get better at something, but you feel that you were chased by the lion instead. So no feeling better from dopamine release after the processs.
