- #[[Question]]  [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]] What system do YOU use to review and process your [[fleeting notes]]? Thanks for sharing üôè
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] Partly because I'm an auditory learner, I intake new information best when I am listening to something, rather than actually visually reading
        1. When I am ready to capture a new `Fleeting Note` I quickly open up my iPhone and run a "Hey Siri!" command using iOS Shortcuts, which copies the link, timestamped, of whatever I am listening to and then opens [[Otter.ai]], populating the title with the link to the exact time of the source material.
            - #Reply-from [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]] Ah, this is your way of highlighting an audio source.
            - #[[Question]]   Are you also dictating fleeting notes at this stage? Is Otter able to listen to the podcast and your voice at the same time?
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] Exactly, and sometimes the recording will go on for several minutes, and I've learned to capture more than less, especially all of the tangential ideas that are coming up to the surface in the moment
                    - I don't want to be tied down to the orthodoxy of just capturing a word or a phrase, when technology has been improved so much that I can rattle on for a couple of minutes until I've sufficiently exhausted my thoughts on the `Fleeting` idea
                    - The main point is to not break the flow-state of reading, or listening, but my ability to jump back in is perfectly fine, since the actual vocalization of my ideas and thoughts, makes me want to jump back in--hungry to learn more!
        2. This way, I have both the context of what I'm thinking about and the reference of where it came from quickly saved in amber
            - I look at it this way, since I am able to capture the actual thoughts, and musings on exactly why this source resonated with me, when moving it through the next phases
        3. I have all of these recordings set inside of a template inside of Roam, where I have a team that organizes them, so I can jump in and get to work when I am ready
            - This is leveraging the fact that there is no API, and hiring a inexpensive Virtual Assistant is hugely beneficial. 
            - It's a matter of copy and pasting the source into the pre-defined template
        4. When I am ready to get to work, usually during the brief moments of time I have available, I move the entire block (containing the `Fleeting Notes`, the `References` and then I listen back to the original source in order to distill and write out the `Literature Notes` in my own words)
        5. Once I have both a summary of the voice memo (Fleeting), and I have written blocks of (Literature) notes, then I `Shift+Click` my (Permanent Notes) page in order to see where it fits inside of my [[Zettelkasten]]
        6. I then stumble upon the places where it would best fit, and then decide on the best location to continue the conversation
        7. Once I create a child-block underneath where this new note fits best, I look back at BOTH the summary from the `Fleeting Notes` and the multiple blocks of `Literature Notes` and then write the `Permanent Note` buttressed against the parent-block that is this note is nested under
            - #Question  [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]] So you wouldn't make a permanent note from your literature notes until you've reviewed your existing permanent notes to see where the new lit note concepts might fit?
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] The literature notes are brought down to a permanent note, only because I have found a place in the nested sequence of notes, for it to live.
                    - The purpose of this is to have this continued dialogue, by only adding a new permanent note buttressed against what I've already written
                    - The literature note that I'm working on is solidified, by crystalizing it's place in the nested sequence
                    - If a place can't be found with complete assurance, then a decision is made to create a new parent block, with hopes that that new permanent note will eventually grow in branches over time, which often it does--in surprising ways~
        8. I have a certain workflow after that, but that's basically how I process each day
    - This sounds incredibly complex, but so is attempting to show someone who doesn't know how to ride a bicycle, with merely words... It's altogether really simple, once you jump on the two-wheeled machine and start pedaling~
        - [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]] Thanks much
    - #Reply[[Kristen Pavle]] üëãüèº [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]], here's my process
        - I take fleeting notes in a notebook, and I also highlight a few select passages in whatever I'm reading in a fleeting style, so I go back to these two sources to move from `fleeting `‚û°Ô∏è `literature` and `permanent` notes
        - I try to focus my first "pass" of reviewing `fleeting` notes on `literature`notes, but sometimes my brain is already cooking up some `permanent`notes, so I don't restrict those from emerging.
        - I use a very iterative process of re-writing what I think my `fleeting` notes are saying to turn them into `literature`notes, and regardless of if I'm using Roam or not, I like to use a nested bullet approach
        - So let's say for How to Take Smart Notes, I have `fleeting` notes about writing notes to self, note taking as a way to identify personal blindspots, creating an ecosystem within which to notetaker/research/write, exergonic vs endergonic reactions, limited resources of short-term/memory/attention/motivation.... this might end up looking like the following `literature` notes:
            - "The easiest and most fun way to write is to set yourself up for success by taking smart notes. Write notes to your [[future self]]."
                - #notetaking about insights generated, about what you've learned (as a reader or researcher), and how we understand things. This will leave you better prepared in any written endeavor.
                - Not to mention, if you plan for insight as a writer, new ideas are what sustains our energy, attention, and motivation - in a way that is more #endergonic than #exergonic.
                - Writing helps us confront ourselves - understand ourselves.
                    - writing yourself free.¬†[[Johannes Niederhauser]]
                    - Even if you "fail", this helps with increasing your understanding of self
            - "#notetaking can be a kind of personal blindspot, if our #notetaking system is not designed with a built-in feedback mechanism, we won't know if we're taking horrible notes or fantastic notes. We'll be working in alignment with our confirmation biases."
                - Part of this is due to the way the brain works - perceiving and interpreting information simultaneously. Taking a step back to formulate notes in our own thinking gives us space to look closely at our thinking and where we may be encountering blindspots.
                - "...to see what we see instead of what we expect to see..." (p.126) requires a kind of trickster approach of viewing our blindspots.
                - We can only break patterns of thinking when we become aware of them.
            - "Our goal, as writers, is to create a kind of #ecosystem within which we can be flexible, creative, associative, playful. Indeed, we are not attempting to bootstrap our writing on the backs of #self-discipline and #self-control "
                - The¬†**structure**¬†of the ecosystem must take into account our limited resources in [[short-term memory]], #attention, and #motivation (#willpower).
                    - One way of doing this is to reduce the number of decisions we have to make, every step along the way. For example - always taking fleeting notes in the same notebook, using the same process for moving from fleeting to permanent notes, and regularly taking breaks (potential to tie in [[pomodoro technique]])
                    - Another way, outside the scope of this book, is writing down all of the little things we have to do in our lives, so our brains, our [[working memory]] are not thinking about what we need to do or worrying about what's not yet done. [[David Allen]] [[getting things done]] or #GTD is one such workflow to manage these types of tasks. The goal being to have a "mind like water" - flowing through the day.
        - And then I continue adding to this structure, updating as I go. I might even end up collapsing some of these bullets, too, if it makes sense. 
        - IDK if this is useful to you - but this is my process as of now! 
        - Also worth mentioning:
            - "Preface note: I don't like restricting myself to the chapter `literature` notes system, it doesn't make intuitive sense to me... it's also too burdensome for me to link notes to blocks of text from the book, too many extra steps, too linear. My brain doesn't work this way (at least it's not efficient nor effective for me). If there is a specific quote or section, I'll note the specific location. "
            - FWIW, I may be breaking too many "rules" and this is too idiosyncratic, but it seems to work for me
- #Post [[Beau Haan üìå]] I just started a new Project Zettelkasten, completely firewalled from my main Zettelkasten, and even with 11 `Permanent Notes` in the last 3 days, there is no real sinking feeling of, "Yeah, this is powerful"
    - I say this to give you hope that even as you start, the process takes time, and the building only begins compounding when it is consistent and deliberate...
    - This also explains why it's much easier to just have the dialogue at the `Fleeting` and/or the `Literature` phases, which confuses people on this journey
    - Neither one of those phases contain the solidified points that a `Permanent` note has, so the muddled discussion becomes even more muddled, until adopting this way of working becomes... "not worth it"
    - Keep trudging along folks~
    - #Reply [[Kristen Pavle]] Hey [[Beau Haan]]! Curious how you're approaching `permanent` note organization in Zettel land. Are you numbering your notes? Are simply taking advantage of the Roam nested bullets and filing new `permanent` notes as appropriate with related notes already in the slipbox?
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] Take a quick look at [[RBC/Admin]] to see how I've organized `Permanent Notes` in [[Roam]]
            - The question ought to be, why [[Niklas Luhmann]] utilized a numbering system in the first place. What use did demarcating a note with a number help with his [[Zettelkasten]]?
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2Fn49RQwtjUu.png?alt=media&token=f80d44fe-7d20-4b71-b555-837a5199b0bd)
                - If the fundamental idea of being able to reference that note through retrieval is correct, then this is where [[Roam]] shines, but with the inherent structureless form that this tool has, the idea is to keep it as simple as possible, allowing for complexity only when necessary
                - I think the most important thing about a [[Zettelkasten]] is to be able to see AND understand the connections of totally disparate notes can have on a person's knowledge database
                - If everything is written in our own words, and when `Relevant Notes` from the furthest points of our graph can be linked, then the power isn't just how to retrieve them, but how much further can we push this...
