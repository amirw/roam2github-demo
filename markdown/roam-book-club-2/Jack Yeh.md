    - "Have anyone here engaged with [[Awakening from the Meaning Crisis]]? I think it's a really fascinating piece of work, full of deeply networked references - I'd love to collaborate with others on a book club, or even trying to build some interesting networked artefacts based on it. How about [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]], would love your thoughts as a psychiatrist. Here are my notes on the most recent episode I listened to - [[Notes on Awakening from the Meaning Crisis 11]] (I decided to paste it in here, since who knows, maybe I can find some connections to this book club). All the yellow highlights are my own thoughts and questions."

        - "Define a fleeting note in your own words. "
            - Fleeting notes are notes noted as a placeholder for an idea in your knowledge management system to be elaborated on later (within a day or two). 
        - "Discuss the fleeting note phase"
            - "How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method."
                - In a specific Roam page for the book, under the chapter heading. I note down the idea in my own words, and include a "Quote" section to capture the quote from the book whenever I feel the quote adds to the note itself.
                    - I type in the quote itself to increase the friction, such that I don't use quotes as a crutch for writing in my own words to encode in my own memory and understanding of the concept.
                - Disadvantages of my method is that it is high friction, and I do need to be in front of my computer. Would like to find a quicker, lower friction method that doesn't interrupt the flow of my reading.
