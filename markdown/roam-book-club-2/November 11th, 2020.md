- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"Can a [zettel]([[permanent notes]]) ever be wrong? If yes or no, what does that mean?"
    1. [[Wade Dominic]] [*](((q2Z3mJyYe)))
        - **Can it be wrong?**
            - This one is a tough one. I would say yes. For the following reasons
                - It is an assumption which is later proven to be incorrect
                    - it is a field in which you are learning about and were unaware of other literature
                    - it is a field in which you are in front of and you are exploring new territory
                - It is found that there is a much better zettel than that one which exhibits much more clarity and addresses all the same content
        - **What does this mean?**
            - Although I am still yet to implement a Zettelkasten in my Roam. I have been giving a lot of thought as to how I would manage it. There is a lot of algorithms from programming that can be brought across to the Zettelkasten process.
            - One example of this is [[Garbage Collection]]
                - https://twitter.com/tartanllama/status/1296413612907663361?s=21
            - What I have in mind is unlike the old Zettelkasten where it was impossible to get a whole overview of it. In this medium I think you can get pretty close. One could trace through their permanent notes marking them as reviewed with a datestamp. Then you could pick this up at any point in time in the future and filter out the ones you have already reviewed, their review stage or review date ranges. Although I am yet to thoroughly think this through. Some possible markers could be something like `checked`, `open to more links`, `archive` or `up for deletion`. This tracing process would provide the opportunity to review the quality of your zettels and their connections in a systematic way. Sometimes you may not know how a zettel connects to another and only upon seeing it after reviewing a bunch of others you have made would that connection become clear. I would treat the `archive` tag with care or `up for deletion` tag with extreme caution. But having these here would allow you to ensure the quality of your zettelkasten over time with the ability to filter them out. 
                - Just as much you don't want to "**clog up the pipes**" ~ [[Beau Haan üìå]] by entering junk. You don't want to keep things that are **rotting**. eg [software rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_rot)
                - #quote The¬†second law of thermodynamics, in principle, states that a¬†closed system's¬†disorder¬†cannot be reduced, it can only remain unchanged or increase. A measure of this disorder is¬†entropy. This law also seems plausible for¬†software systems; as a system is modified, its disorder, or entropy, tends to increase. This is known as¬†**software entropy**.
                    - Source:: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_entropy
                - I would view any new entry of a zettel and linking it as a modification.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] In the digital information age. A Zettelkasten requires a systematic process to avoid entropy and decay of the dialogue that one has with their Zettelkasten.
                    - #Reply-from [[Kate Foy üå±]] ÔøΩ
                - #Reply-from [[Jason Griffing]] I have not put anything nearly as sophisticated in place as what is described above. But I have started experimenting with a sort of spaced repetition method to keep the "rot" down. Every time I write a permanent note, and also for some literature notes I find more compelling, I simply drop a future date onto the end of the block. That way it pops up in my daily notes later for a refresher. I mark it sequentially with a 1,2,3 etc when it pops up so that I can tell how many times I've reviewed it. Sometimes in this process I come across notes that seemed so compelling when I wrote them but after a week or two, seem kind of worthless. I always struggle with knowing what to do with such notes. 
                    - #Reply-from  [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]]  Thanks for the spaced repetition idea. It's a simple way to review things that matter. I'm just added a "Reviewed:" bullet point to my [[permanent note]] template. I'll use this to keep track of the days I've reviewed the note.
                    - #Reply-from [[Wade Dominic]] As I described above in my bottom [fleeting note](((GG-KRktoA))) we just need some kind of process in place I think. The process I described is quite sequential but I also like this idea and was also thinking of something similar when I was writing the above. Though I did not put it in writing tsk tsk haha. I was reflecting on what [[Shana Pote]] described with the random resurfacing of the fleeting notes. By applying that process to the one you described with marking them sequentially based on when they have been seen you could randomly resurface ones that have been seen the least. Maybe even a short range range so it's not purely the ones that have been seen the least. 
                        - [[@[[Jason Griffing]]]] As for what you said with the struggling with what to do with them. I would just mark them with a tag to distinguish between the ones you are uncertain on. `keep?`, `archive`, etc. Keep them around for a while. Filtering when you only want the ones you think have the highest value. With the option to review the "kind of worthless" notes in the future.

            - #Reply-from[[Jason Griffing]] Thanks for sharing this. Helpful to see a high-level overview. My workflow is similar conceptually. Where I tend to wrestle with the zettelkasten "mechanics" most is higher up in the flow. I'm still grappling with how to organize my workflow and graph for things like permanent notes and project pages. 
            - #Reply [[Brandon Toner]] That's next for me ‚Äî [[@[[Jason Griffing]]]]

[[project ideas]] ‚Äî nested under the section on [[My Zettelkasten]] 

[[permanent notes]] ‚Äî¬†will have a separate page, and indexed under that section. [*](((MDjwP5YuL)))

- #Chat [[Kate Foy üå±]] I am fascinated by the responses here to definitions/thoughts about the various kinds of notes in the system under review, and about the way individuals see the relationships that play out amongst such notes. It's clear to me that flexibility is possible, probably necessary given the journey from "fleeting" to "permanent" as descriptors, with much "pivoting" (the word of the moment) happening as we go. The big challenge, whatever way one chooses to define and use the system developed by [[S√∂nke Ahrens]], will be determined by the understanding, needs, and inclinations of the individual.   
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] üôåüèº 
        - Individual > everything else
        - Jeez~ that sounds so selfish, but it reminds me of what they say when you first sit on an airplane and they announce that you put the oxygen mask on your face, before assisting the person next to you
            - #Reply-from [[Kate Foy üå±]] üòÄ
    - #Reply [[Brandon Toner]] Great words & insights. I'm also fascinated by the thoughts around definitions. For me, once I understand the terms and have a model ‚Äî I can operate with ease and clarity. Which is ultimately my goal. 

To be able to forget the system and engage with the content and my ideas.
        - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] The [[meta]] fades when the system is clear."
            - #Reply-from [[Kate Foy üå±]] - in a nutshell! Love it.
            - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] yes! me too. Great.
- #Chat [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] do you all think this might be useful as a class of notes? (see [[Mike Kramer]]'s question here)

Something like a "gateway note" or "index note"? 

Wondering if we should add this to the CSS ... "#Question[[Mike Kramer]]Is [**this**](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/%C2%A7Corporate_research_lab_practices) note from [[Andy Matuschak]] an example of a {{alias:((UuMRDEmqT))type 1 connection}}?"
    - #Reply [[Brandon Toner]] What if you simply tagged one of your permanent notes with #[[entry point]]? [[~[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]]
- #Chat[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] wondering what you all might make of this short #video from [[Michael Curzi]] on #reading : 
    - he ([[Michael Curzi]]) proposes four ways to read #texts:
        -  1. the text itself as artifact 
        - 2. the text as description of the world
        - 3. the text as a place that summons reflections (emotional? experiential?) for you
        - 4. the text as a place that actually shapes (?) you? (teaches you? "improves" you?)

    - Had a sizeable breakthrough thanks to [this article](((R_mI78x1y))) in [[RoamBrain]]. Feeling thankful for [[Roam Book Club]] for giving me the push I needed to sort out my understanding of a [[Zettelkasten in Roam]]. I can feel tangible progress! Some of my current thoughts:
        - [[reference notes]]: 
- [[Readwise]] (from [[Memex]], [[Kindle]], [[Airr]], [[Twitter]])
- automated metadata for the [[bibliographical notes]]
*This is beautiful, Readwise does so much of the heavy lifting. Truly effortless.

[[literature notes]]:
- formed from the reference notes (basic [[summary]] of key points highlighted by the author)

[[permanent notes]]:
- synthesis across several permanent notes
        - A lasting struggle I have is how differently do I treat ‚Äúoriginal‚Äù or inspired thought. 

Ideas and writing **that is *not* derived from literature** or other consumed content. __Ideas that arise from within. __

#Chat [[Brandon Toner]] How could these evolve in parallel with [this](((mZcPiCpnK))) system?
            - [[Jason Caro]] hey Brandon, I'm having similar conversations with myself. 
            - I‚Äôm thinking...

[[fleeting notes]]: (not set on term)
- [[idea]] and the meaningful setting or [[context]] (e.g. [[conversation]] with X)

Then those arise to [[permanent notes]] as would [[literature notes]] ‚Äî they just wouldn‚Äôt be as well-referenced and supported. 

The support would be the context.
                - example:: [here](((5HTD5O7OT))) and [here](((QuZWAKAb5))), I expressed an [[atomic idea]]. Is this a [fleeting note]([[fleeting notes]])? Or something else? #Question [[Brandon Toner]] #Highlight
                    - #Chat [[~[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]], I'm curious your thoughts here.
                        - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] hi Brandon! I have come around to the interpretation of "permanent note" as meaning "the note is substantially __my own idea__", i.e. "it's now permanently part of my own slipbox". In the end it's the distinction of authorship, that feels like the most important boundary to define for me.
                            - So for me, both of the notes, though short, seem to have the flavor of permanent notes
                            - They both feel like personal conclusions which might have been inspired by the text but which you arrived at as fully your own formulation.
                            - Therefore I'd think of these as permanent notes if they were in my own graph.
                        - I think I just came up with the "catchphrase" that captures the entire book for me, btw ...
                        - I would summarize the book's core concept as **"atomic authorship"**
                        - My sense is that is what it is really about at its core
                    - #Reply [[Brandon Toner]] YES YES YES!! 

This captures my feeling precisely. I'm averse to [[permanent]] as the type of note because "#[[Fleeting Notes]] few ideas are truly [[permanent]] #[[permanent notes]]" and I want to physiologically leave room for upgrading my ideas. All of my thoughts are perpetually "under construction" ‚Äî with varying degrees of [[attachment]].
                        - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] few ideas are truly [[permanent]] #[[permanent notes]]"
            - **Also, what should I do with the *random* ideas I have while consuming content on a different topic?** 

Like, while listening to a podcast on philosophy, I have a breakthrough with a pharmacy idea. 

How should I capture that content and those relations?
                - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] my own inclination is that, to me, I feel like that's almost the very definition of a fleeting note. It's the surface-level, spontaneous stuff that just passes quickly through your mind, often while you are concentrating on something else' 
                    - I have a section in my daily notes called "Odds and Ends (sparkly things drawer)" where I jot down all the random little "orphan" ideas that occur to me during the day. Some of them turn into fully-fledged ideas later, some of them don't.
                - #Reply [[Brandon Toner]] ‚Äî yup, this captures my feelings as well. Thanks so much for your contributions here üôèüéâ #HIGH-FIVE
    - #observation - I write differently in a [[shared graph]]. 
        - There are differences in the conventions and in the style that I typically write in my Roam. 
        - example:: [here](((mZcPiCpnK))), I used line breaks where I might typically use more blocks. Something feels better about larger blocks in here.

    - #Question [[Brandon Toner]] What is the best way to mark a [[notification]] as read?
        - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] if you switch the "@" out for a "~" then it will mark it as "seen"  [[~[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]]
            - `This is a notification:` `[[@[[Brandon Toner]]]]`
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I know that [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] came up with:

[[~[[Beau Haan üìå]]]] that's using `~` as the trigger to invoke that CSS
                - #Reply [[Brandon Toner]] There was also an "attention center" system outlined in the recent [[RoamFM]] episode with [[Mat McGann]]. 

This was the episode where he describes running his ENTIRE startup business on a [[Roam]] [[shared graph]]!! (4 employees, all trained on Roam). 

He described a system for notifications I could find. Might look into that sometime soon. I like this system above though!
                    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] We discussed it at length, but the implementation would be much harder with so many people, so we decided to go with the much easier, yet not as aesthetic, route
                        - However, [[Mat McGann]] was super helpful in sharing his CSS code with us and answering questions on his technique~
