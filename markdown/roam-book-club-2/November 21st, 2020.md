- #CHAT [[Denise Todd]] It's been suggested that fleeting notes lead to literature notes, which lead to Permanent notes.  That linear construct has been uncomfortable for me so I decided to challenge that construct. This is not to say that this construct doesn't work well for others, just for me, I think the construct could be developed to even better leverage both the power of ROAM and the power of Zettlekasten even more. This is my draft attempt at that and I'd love feedback on what you think works, and what doesn't. 
    - My theory is that the relationship between fleeting notes, literature and permanent notes is not linear, nor hierarchical but dimensional.  
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] [[@Denise Todd]] I love the dimensional idea, but I still prefer something akin to the 3 phases of all matter; solid, liquid, and gas
            - As for the linearity of the process, the separations are meant to be mile-markers, if anything to remind you of the different steps with the end goal of creating thoroughly thought-through `Permanent` notes
                - Which is why I disagree with the `Seedling` metaphor, since the relationship we have with seeds is one of time, compared to phases of matter--which can be flash-frozen, quickly taking an idea through `Fleeing`‚Üí `Literature (contained by Reference Notes)`‚Üí into a solid `Permanent` note
                - The goal is to have that dialogue with the **final phase** of these notes, to argue, complement, and expand upon the notes that have been solidified in the process
            - It's something like a recipe for a cake, you can skip the eggs, and the final product won't be what you're expecting.
            - The structure that is supposed to be trusted in, is there so the process can be forgotten about. It's allowing for that flow-state that everyone talks about, and that usually happens when there are no "decisions" that have to be made--which makes for more thinking and writing about the topic, instead of thinking about the process
                - #Reply-from [[Denise Todd]] to [[Beau Haan]] I believe that you can get into a "flow" state and make decisions -- think of driving as an example.  We are able to drive without making conscious decisions about checking our mirrors, pressing the break, etc like we had to the first time in the car.  I do very much trust the process, but I think the Process that works for one, might not be the best for another.   
                    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I totally agree, and why I'm a huge proponent of the "personalization" of the first 2 phases, in regards to how to capture things. But I think of it more like the actual processes that have already been forgotten; the checking of the mirror, the starting of the engine, the muscle-memory of the steering wheel and brakes. Those really can't be taught, they have to be done by rote until it eases into the back of our minds
                    - And once we've "forgotten" where everything is, then the higher level of abstractions can be discovered, because now we're on the road with the music blaring, in our thoughts, wrestling with ideas
        - #Reply  [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]]  Perhaps one way to look at this problem is that note-taking is [[unstuck in time]] (thanks [[Kurt Vonnegut]]).
            - In our "normal" way of looking at time, things happen in a linear fashion. The creation of a __particular__ permanent note is built on already-written literature notes and fleeting notes. You would not start with a permanent note and then go look for sources to prove it and then write literature notes.
            - But if you look at this from the point of view of the whole process (instead of a particular note), then it seems to be temporally non-linear.
                - For example, I write out a few fleeting notes from a chapter on How to Take Smart Notes. These ideas are on things like productivity, decision-making, non-duality, the carnivore diet, etc.
                - A little later, I make literature notes on things that are relevant to me. But wait! I just had another idea that is made into a fleeting note. I jot it down and return to taking literature notes.
                - Before I've finished taking literature notes on the chapter, an insight arises and I feel like I've been hit by a ton of bricks! ü§Ø I just know that this insight fits into a particular spot within my permanent notes. I search my Zettlekasten, write the new permanent note, place it, and move back to taking literature notes on the book I'm currently reading.
                - In this way, each permanent note is solidly built on literature, fleeting and reference notes, yet the whole process seems non-linear when looking at it from our normal way of viewing time.
                    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] üôåüèºüôåüèºüôåüèº How you just explained that was superb!
                - Hey, I haven't taken a single permanent note yet, so feel free to correct my thinking. üôè
                    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] "Start yesterday" -- Every investor ever
        - Per [[Sonke] -
            - [*](((BL5wHnXDF))) Fleeting notes are only reminders of information 
            -  [*](((pZ1dkTn5N))) Should not cause distraction
            - Should enable you to focus on the reading
            - [*](((pZ1dkTn5N))) You can skip fleeting notes and go write to Permanent Notes if the thought is already fully formed. 
        - Upon review of your fleeting notes, you can do five things (in good GTD fashion) as I see it --
            - 1.  ^^Trash them ^^
                - They had not real value to begin with, or
                - You wrote it so poorly that it has no meaning when you review it 
                    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] That is one of looking at it, but you can also leverage the time you've put into creating these `Fleeting` notes by allowing those notes to help inform you of what the more crystallized `Permanent` notes will say
                        - The power of [[Roam]] is that if you nest this at the bottom of each `Permanent` note, you don't have to throw these thoughts out, since there is not limit to space and area, since this is stored in a digital format
                        - [[Niklas Luhmann]] had to worry about cluttering up his physical slip-box and working area around his desk, and I can only imagine what a bunch of scribbled ideas on napkins would end up as if not thrown away~

            - Turn it into a ^^Literature note ^^
                - For notes that were a reminder of something specific to this book (or other media), turn the fleeting not into a literature  note.  
                - For notes that were a trigger for thoughts related to another book - also turn into a Literature Note but reference both this book (as it triggered the thought for a reason) and the original book it referred to.  This likely might me more of a permanent note depending on the thought development and importance 
                    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] From my understanding of what you're saying: Notes that remind me of something specific to this book or other media would still be classified as part of the `Fleeting` notes phase
                        - #reply-to [[Beau Haan]] from [[Denise Todd]] You are in the section "Turn into Literature Note" so, here the fleeting note would be turned into a Literature note -- just like your standard process, as I understand it. 
                        - And for notes that were a trigger for thoughts related to another book would also fall in as `Fleeting` notes
                        - So then to truly define the difference between the `Fleeting` and `Literature` note phases, I turn to the analogy of the 3 phases of all matter again...
                            - If the `Fleeting` ideas are in a gaseous form, and as they begin to converge, (all of the ways it relates to other things like you mentioned earlier), then the slow convergence into a `Literature` note happens when that precipitation of those thoughts liquify into the container held up by the `Reference` notes
                            - The `Literature` notes are to test how well we have understood what the author is talking about
                            - It's almost like a fail-proof way to know whether the reader has understood what the author has written about, by integrating what is INSIDE of the text, output by your own words
                            - There are notes on the `Literature` but written in your words, to exemplify not just understanding but synthesis through flexing your ability to string together the sentence in your own way
                                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FDZUlP-ajLV.png?alt=media&token=e0e5e74d-e0e3-4406-be2c-490642033349)
            - Turn it into a ^^Permanent Note^^ - for more fully developed thoughts of importance.  Will have multiple sources linked not just the one fleeting or literature note. 
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] This part is the trickiest since the complexity depends on how far along in the building of a [[Zettelkasten]] you are at:
                    - The $$1$$st `Permanent` note will feel awkward, just like a 7 year old struggles with the concept of a bicycle
                    - You have no idea how the thought fits into anything, or how the conversation is going to start
                    - The subsequent `Permanent` notes will either expand on a previous note, or add a new starting point for other notes to expand upon
                        - {{[[embed]]: ((((0mrJMhDVh))))}}
                    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] But there's still the most important, literally the most important step for the entire [[Zettelkasten]] which is actually linking the `Relevant` notes to the `Permanent` note
                        - This is where the power of [[Zettelkasten]] really comes to life, once you hit your stride and start seeing **clusters** (where you see child blocks getting deeper and deeper into indents)
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FA2wc93xTmx.png?alt=media&token=6bcf94eb-337b-4bdb-bc25-0672ad8f4398)
                        - This is the main difference between a relational database, compared to the brain-like graph database, that can stretch far between nodes, creating connections, that lead to insight...
                        - But all of that happens when the solid, crystallized, thoughts, that have been written in your own words as `Permanent` notes have multiple `Relevant` notes and the clustering shows the topics that have been resonating with you over time
                        - And this is why emphasis on the final phase‚Üí `Permanent` notes is crucial since equating this process to "seeds" and "trees" presupposes that the first 2 phases take a while to produce fruit, but when thinking of the phases like the state phases of matter, can make us think of this process as a quick process in order to accumulate more and more actual solid blocks to work with
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FUz3JC7OYfS.jpeg?alt=media&token=24ef67bc-363b-4709-b996-69df8e7424c3)
                        - And with each nested block underneath, it creates the dialogue that will show what you've been thinking, and how you've been thinking about it, buttressed by references to the literature, and below all of that the resonating ideas that spawned this solid state of thought
                        - And maybe that's exactly it: ü§Ø
                            - Slowing things down inside of matter, slowing down the thoughts with focus and synthesis, solidifies the `Fleeting` ideas that connect to so many things, backed by the `Literature` held up by the container of `References` that have been crystallized into a solid thought, written in your own words, nested with `Relevant` ideas placed in a certain point in the conversation with yourself
                                - By the way, if we had to think of the the hardest person to convince of anything‚Üí it would most likely be ourselves~
                                - And with this way of working, we'd actually be able to see how we think, with the evidence to support it, and the thoughts over time, to show the progression üò≤
                        - Thanks, [[Beau Haan]] Great insights, as usual. 
            - ^^Turn it into a Todo^^ - likely something that relates to an AREA of responsibility (if I'm using Forte's turn correctly).  It might be a todo, or other type note you want to track for an Area.  These are the random thoughts that pop up during the reading, or anytime during the day of things you need to do or track.  
            - ^^Combine it ^^with other fleeting notes, and then process it as above into a Literature or Permanent or Todo. 
        - Here is a visual - but I warn you, I'm no artist (where is [[Maggie Appleton]] when you need her?? üòâ
