- Reading this book prior to this [[bookclub]] I have created literature notes although the format wont be per chapter.
- Literature Notes::
    - Sonke Ahrens takes us through the process of note-taking, used by Dr [[Niklas Luhmann]] coined the term [[Zettelkasten]].
    - Writing helps us expand and organize our thoughts when we want to share ideas with others. Writing is the best for reading, thinking, generating ideas. It is the most important. In order to further develop our ideas, we need to have a pen in hand to keep contributing to the pool of thoughts.
    - Students and alike struggle to write because they are taught to write on a blank page rather than starting with ideas taken overtime. 
    - Just because you read a lot more books or sources of information does not mean you know and understand more. If you are not taking notes in your own words, you will most likely forget all you've read. 
    - In order to think of ideas you need to get them out of your head by writting them down.
    - The process of taking notes is first to [[fleeting notes]], which is to capture ideas that come to mind by writing them down. Fleeting notes are just thoughts you may have and the idea is to jot them down, doesn't matter on what surface, a napkin, paper, etc.
    - Write a [[literature note]], where you jot down source information including, making notes about the content, ideas, or areas that bring up questions. When you come across quotes, think about what they mean rather than copying verbatim. 
    - Permanent notes are the process of going through literature notes and thinking about, how does this relate to my research, thinking, or interests? The idea is to not collect more, but instead to develop ideas, arguments, and discussions. Once the permanent note is developed you add it to the [[slip box]]. Nowadays we have digital programs like roam (which I'm using currently).
    - Overtime try and develop various topics or projects. Read your [[permanent notes]] and think to yourself what is missing or what if any questions arise. Now the power of the [[slip box]] or digital system begins to shine the more it's used. The ideas multiple and more connections are made which make it easier to start a project about a certain topic, rather than the blank screen.
    - If you are working on a project, take the rough notes and turn them into a rough draft. Translate the notes into something you understand, and makes sense. Detect what your argument is and seek ways to fill any holes or maybe change your stance completely. 
    - When putting notes away you should always ask your self this question under which context would I like to stumble on this note again. This will ensure it is placed or tagged appropriately for easy reference in the future. That may also lead to further questions about the content of the note.
    - Initially, when writing down an idea it should be as brief as possible, but you should revisit the idea in a day or two to remember what you meant and to also further expand on the idea.
    - There is another type of note specifically for projects, which can be, outlines, reminders, todos, comments in manuscripts and collections of project-related literature. 
    - [[Carol Dweck]], research shows us in the most convincing factor for long-term success is having a "growth mindset". By actively seeking our feedback positive or negative. 
    - An interesting piece of information from a study conducted by (Miller 1956) is that the human mind can only hold 7 things maximum in our head at the same time. 
    - [[Zeigarnik effect]] revealed that open tasks occupy our short terms memory until we declare them done. One way to trick our brain to think the task is complete is to write it down. The first step is to write down tasks into smaller pieces then write down possible connections to further ideas and questions. 
    - [[Barack Obama]] and [[Bill Gates]] only wore two suit colours, so that they eliminate the need for choices thus saving brainpower to focus on the things that truly mattered. 
    - Any project that we are engaged in taking breaks is super important. Breaks are more than just recovering they are crucial for learning.
    - Reading books is great, but highlighting sentences, or writing in the margins is not enough to truly grasp the ideas and content of the book. In the Zettle method you really need to write these section in your own words, and on a separate note-taking system (whatever that maybe)
    - During lectures, we can take notes by hand but in most cases are done using technology such as laptops. In one study they found that students taking notes by hand faired better in understanding and recalling the material in the future. That is not to say using technology is bad, by all means, use what's easier for you. Just remember to go through your notes and create permanent notes a day or two later.
    - When connecting thoughts and idea together we force ourselves to truly understand the content and distinguish ideas from each other
    - Transferring ideas from our mind to paper (short-term memory) will make our minds forget about that particular idea. This may say contradicting but by doing this we actively make room for long-term learning. 
    - Choosing keywords or tags is important, and the way a writer should approach this by asking under which circumstance do I want to stumble on this note again, even if I forget about it? This will allow us to properly tag the note for future reference. Keywords should be given by the topic we are working on or interested in. Don't assign a keyword-based solely on this article alone.
    - Coming across old notes the idea seems to be the same but in reality, the idea is slightly but crucially different. Maybe our thoughts or feelings on a particular subject changed slightly. That's why is important to periodically look at the older notes. Digitally there is a randomizer that can show you a random note with the purpose of presenting you with an older idea that can spark a new topic or feeling/emotion.  
    - Using this system daily we verify what we understand from text, by understanding what we wrote down prior. The idea is to focus on the gist. Make it a habit to think about what is possibly missing when we jot down our own ideas. **Practice writing good questions**
    - By organizing work we bring our projects in the right direction and it becomes fun in the process.
    - Questions:: 
        - [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] called the [[hermeneutic circle]]. What is this and how can this be applied to taking smart notes? 
        - Follow up on [[Miller, George A. 1956]]. "The magical number seven, plus or minus two: some limits on our capacity for processing information."
        - Think about this quote more "Have the courage to use your own understanding, is, therefore, the motto of enlightenment". 
- Fleeting Notes::
