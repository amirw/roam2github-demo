        - #[[Literature Notes]] Our work can feel like an exergonic reaction which requires you to continuously add energy to sustain the process. Or in some cases we can be in flow and our work can feel like an endergonic reaction which continues by themselves and even energize us.
            - Exergonic reactions require adding energy to sustain the process. 
            - Endergonic reactions continue by themselves and can release energy once started.
            - Our work can sometimes feel like we need to add more energy to sustain the process.
            - But in some cases, our work can continue by themselves and even give us more energy because we are in flow.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] understanding that we naturally create new associations through our curiosity connects us to our inner abundance and our ability to create value for others.
            - the relationships between nature, money, energy, work. understanding how to move past the resistance of creating something new by connecting to our inner abundance. abundance of ideas, stored value, being pulled along by the ideas that we have.
            - Energy
                - Connected to nature
                    - Cause and effect
                        - Tree gets energy from sun, sugar, nutrients, water from roots, creates apples
                            - Natural process
                                - Also creates abundance
                                    - Humans get stuck by forgetting about the abundance that they have
                                        - We sometimes, 1-to-1 things, energy goes into 1 bucket
                                            - Instead of something that creates a lot of itself
                                                - Eg: Note-taking, could be re-used
                                                    - Branching of ideas
                                                        - Creating books as output
                - Also, I've been thinking about money
                    - Stored energy
                        - Store of value in our notes
                    - With money there's perceived scarcity
                        - Evident in my own upbringing
                            - It's passed down
                                - Because we don't understand energy = money, like nature
                                    - Money is limited, never have enough
                                        - That is artificial scarcity
                                            - Not actual
            - Potential energy
                - Create something new
                    - Infinite possibilites
                        - Associations
                            - Potential energy into output
                                - Books
                                    - Potential insights
                                        - One of the outputs is wisdom
                                            - How things work in the world, and how we relate to the world
            - Energy in motion
                - Stagnation
                    - Not progressing forward
                - Moving, less resistence
                    - When we're stuck, we can feel less energy
                        - Energy not being expressed
            - Resistence
                - How that relates energy
                - When we're stuck in that
                    - Prevents us to move to where we want to go
                        - We can add to that, by running in a loop
                        - Self contained energy suck
                            - You never get to what you want to do
            - Work flows like draining our energy
                - Distracted
                    - What if I did this in the past...
                        - I don't have to worry about this now
                            - It's linked to "oh, I could have been using Roam..." a year ago
            - Where I disagree
                - We can only move forward...
                    - That isn't necessarily true
                        - It's comparison sometime what we feel like
                            - Our work already started, we are pulled along
                                - Instead of resisting it
                                    - Shutting down intuition, and creativity
                                        - I misunderstood this at first
                                            - I get it now
            - Rhythym
                - What is our personal rhythm
                    - Are we connected to that
                        - How do we feel about something
                            - Ties into our level of energy
                                - "Out of rhythm"
                                    - If we're always following social media
                                        - Speed of technology
                                            - Disconnected from inner rhythm
                                                - OUR HEARTBEAT
                                                    - Body rhythm
                                                        - Leads to poor health and stress
                                                            - Prevents us from actually being happy

- energy
- exergonic - add energy
    - procrastination as a state of inertia and low energy. we need to constantly add energy to move past the state of resistance.
    - often times the easiest way to move past this resistance is to just start and then let momentum pull us forward.
- endergonic - triggered reaction continues by itself and may release energy
    - bring pulled along by the ideas - we are chosen by our ideas, we don't chose the ideas
    - resonance - following our curiosity and interest
- Difference between adding energy to our work (exergonic) and being pulled forward by our work once it has started (endergonic). #[[Literature Note]]
