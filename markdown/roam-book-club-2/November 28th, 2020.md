Watching the lightbulb click for [[Kristina Wolter]] as she trekked up the mountain to her `Zettel` was worth every second!

        - "#[[Literature Notes]] [Chapter 8. Let the work carry you forward (paragraph 1)](((RK0T2uHBh)))"
            - "Lessons we learned from school about energy can help us understand workflow.  Sometimes workflow demands energy from us, other times workflow has the potential to generate and excite us.  Select a workflow that leverages your limited energy. "
        - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] School theory about energy and workflow - what triggers, excites, and drains"
            - "School"
                - "I think the criticism is that school didn't teach us well"
                    - "We never learned how to apply that concept"
                        - "It brings you back to learning and theories"
                            - "We're taught something but we forget it"
                                - "To apply it to something"
                                    - "Resurface what we learned"
                                        - "To take away an important message"
                - "We learn something and seem to forget it"
            - "Energy stands out"
                - "It's mentioned a lot, but energy is special"
                    - "Limited"
                    - "So don't waste it!!!"
                    - "I knew people in Uganda that would count the meter"
                        - "They knew energy was limited"
                    - "We think we live in unlimited resources"
            - "Triggered"
                - "It reminds me that sometimes"
                    - "Tripwire"
                    - "Sometimes we have to be smacked if we get too close to the fire"
                        - "It has to trigger something"
                            - "Otherwise we're blinded"
                - "Burst of reality"
            - "Reaction"
                - "It makes me think of consequence"
                    - "Not in the negative way"
                        - "A reaction"
                            - "Only hope it's a good one"
            - "Draining of energy"
                - "If we don't want to do something, it takes energy"
                    - "It feels wasted"
                        - "It could be better used"
            - "Workflow"
                - "Something I'm trying to master"
                    - "That I can feel I made the most out of the time that I have"
                        - "If I don't, why were you given that time anyway"
            - "Energizing"
                - "It feels like goosebumps"
                    - "Oooh!"
        - "The author helps us recall key points linked to exergonic and endergonic reactions and how energy is either added to the process or generates energy.  "
            - "An example of this is work - either it drains us or we get into the grove and can't stop. "
        - "This paragraph sounds like inertia - let's find a system that pulls us, while reserving our precious energy. "

    - https://nesslabs.com/inductive-deductive-reasoning could be linked to image memory, because one is based on experience. the concept of reaching the truth is intriguing, but seems unobtainable in completeness. also, links to decision making and problem solving... which I am still trying to unpack.  
    - https://nesslabs.com/interview-marie-poulin great content on digital cultivation? notion. permaculture. useful questions.
