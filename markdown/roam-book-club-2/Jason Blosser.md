        - [[Goals for Book Club]]
            - Growing my ability to take better notes
                - Address to my future self
                - Enough info in fleeting notes to get me to literature or permanent note, but not verbatem
                - How to combat confirmation bias and the way the mind makes assumptions and leaps that may not really be there
                - Reading a book from many perspective
                    - Look for the big ideas
                    - Delve deeply
            - Ability to explain zettlekasten and teach it to others
            - Ability to integrate zettlekasten into good pedagogy and show continuity
            - My personal zettlekasten in Roam Research
                - Developing a system that provides the ability to connect ideas serendipitously
                - Developing a system that helps me to filter for relevance and importance and not worry about an idea falling away
                - Do fleeting notes stay around because Roam allows that easier than the upkeep of a manual system or is it better to see them pruned away?
                - Relationship of fleeting notes to permanent notes
                - How do keywords relate to a zettlekasten index?
                - How do permanent notes relate to literature notes or are they the same?
                - How are clusters of permanent notes developed so I don't forget about them and how can they be grown, merged, even chopped away?
                    - Is there a zettlekasten index of permanent notes and another of keywords?
                - Intrigued with the idea that the more you add to a zettlekasten the more powerful it becomes.  Love the notion, but don't see how that can be
                - Structure ideas
                    - Fleeting note
                        - Very quick
                        - Perhaps highlight
                    - Literature note
                        - Take the time to write idea in my own words
                    - Permanent note
                    - Cluster of permanent notes
                    - Projects
                    - Other elements
                        - Indexes
                        - Keywords
                        - Opposing keywords?
            - Collective zettlekasten used by my staff and faculty to create a living body fo knowledge using Roam Research
                - Believe in the idea that working together can produce something of relevance and quality that one individual couldn't do alone
                    - Is the on-ramping of enough of a collective understanding of Roam, nomenclature, etc. worth what you get?  Will others not invest as much into that portion and therefore the outcome is very difficult to achieve?
                - To on-ramp individuals into the community as a very intentional experience that takes considerable time and effort
                - Create a community where part of the inclusion is to intentionally give back by on-ramping new individuals
                - Takes ~5 hours of use before start to feel comfortable with Roam
