- #Chat [[Beau Haan üìå]] [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] What do you think?
    - I'm toying with CSS to have the `chat`'s stand out more
        - Just added one to reply to!
    - How about this implementation? `#Chat [[My Name]]` and `#Reply [[My Name]]`
    - #Chat [[Beau Haan üìå]]
        - #Reply [[Kate Foy üå±]]
            - V. smart, sir. So the chat hashtag is now upper-case? 
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I was just using upper-case since I didn't want to mess with [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]'s code üò¨
                    - And [[Kate Foy üå±]] if you put your name **after** `#Chat` or `#Reply` the colors will show up... which incidentally shows you whether you did the __convention__ correctly or not
                        - #Reply [[Kate Foy üå±]] very cool! üòé
        - #Reply [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] Looks amazing!
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] Watching you type that in **real-time**, is what's really amazing! ÔøΩ
                - #Reply [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] Haha, it is weird isn't it
                    - #Reply [[Sahil]]
                        - It'd be pretty cool to have a "don't render for anyone else until I'm done" option.
        - #Reply [[Sahil]]
            - ~~Wait, does this apply globally? I'd be wary of anyone being able to set global CSS~~
                - I see that I can filter out themes I don't want, never mind!
            - It's pretty good!
        - #Reply [[Charles Farr]] 10/10 would recommend! Look's awesome [[@Beau Haan]]
    - It forces a convention because the __2nd color__ won't show unless the `[[name]]` is after the `#chat`
    - Blue bubbles for Mac fans~
    - Green bubbles for Android fans~
    - #Chat [[Thomas B.]] #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]]
        - We still need some [[Conventions]] for your nice CSS to work. I think you proposed using the #Chat following with your own name, and then #Reply followed by the name of the person you're replying to. However, I think I'm also seeing a lot of people using #Reply followed by their own name.
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] My hopes were that people would omit the secondary level of repetition, and rather utilize nesting as an indicator of who they are talking to, if that makes sense
                - #Reply [[Your Name]] Being nested below would indicate that this is a reply to the block above
                - This alleviates the clutter of having both `#Chat` and `#Reply` on the same line, or even having to `[[@Name]]` although it's not a perfect way to follow-up with a __"notification"__ it does make it so other's can read the threads easier, IMO
- #Help [[Beau Haan üìå]] We are currently brainstorming ways to have some way of being notified of [[@[[name]]]] mentions, if you have any relevant ideas--please post them below! #roamcult
    - How about adding #Read [[@[[name]]]]?
    - {{[[DONE]]}} [[@[[name]]]] I really like how TODO/DONE looks tho~
    - #Reply [[Tony Tong]] We also need to think about how to pull them in a query  when thinking about this design
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] What if the `/query` was able to filter:

`#@` $$+$$ `[[Name]]` $$+$$ `TODO` $$=$$ That way there's a secondary quantifier?

Not sure if that even works, but was the idea I was toying with
    - #Reply [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] - alas, [[Beau Haan]], even adding the other (3rd) quantifier, you still have the "breadcrumbs problem": 
        - all three are present in one block - so you'll see that block, yes
        - BUT all three are also present in the breadcrumbs of many other blocks, too - you'll get a cumulative list of all breadcrumb-trails that include all three - anywhere in their repective "trail"s - if you try to find them with `{{and:}}`, in a query
    - #Reply [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] just to be clear, the "current system" is that you change the @ that precedes your name in the "alert", swapping it for "~" - like this
        - 
        - [[@[[Matt]]]] means "hey Matt, check this out!"
        - so then, e.g., Matt reads it ...
        - He then swaps it for [[~[[Matt]]]]
            - #Reply[[Tony Tong]] [[@[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]] What if people reply messages nested under a ~ seen block then a query filtering out seen block will not be able to pick up those
                - I guess then "Please do not write in a nested a seen block" should be specified as a guideline 
        - That indicates "seen"
        - The current color-changing CSS is entirely provisional, I think there are better looking solutions, starting with something more like this:
        - "![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2F3oedYuQ0VR.gif?alt=media&token=94b65214-6afb-4a2f-bf52-0818d17d5f17)"
        - there are definitely JavaScript solutions within reach that will ultimately make this easier and not involve keystrokes, but for now this is one "working model"
        - obv not the only model but ...
        - its main advantage is that ALL "active" notifications can be quickly surfaced and reviewed.
        - this is the problem that splitting into multiple hashtags runs into - it's great "in theory" but doesn't "play nicely" with the current functioning of the `/query`, which is made in such a way that it will "search" the entire breadcrumbs-path to a block, in order to search for its arguments
-  #Chat [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] this is just to say that if anybody is not familiar with the use of the side-window, ask someone for help, because it is SO helpful for the process of annotating the text in your own page while reading the original text in side window (or vice versa)
- ‚Üí #Chat [[Beau Haan üìå]] (Used to start a new chat by YOU)

‚Üí #Reply [[My Name]] (Nested underneath, someone's `#Chat`)

‚Üí #Question [[Their Name]] (This is for directing a question AT someone)

‚Üí #Help [[My Name]] (If YOU need help)

‚Üí #Announcement (this one might be important)

‚Üí #@ [[Their Name]] (Used in conjunction with `#Chat` and `#Reply`?)

I'm sure there's more, but at least that would make the [[Daily Notes]] page a little more beautiful?
    - #Reply [[Sue Borchardt]] this looks really useful. I've tried chatting with [[Joel Chan]] in his graph and it's been challenging. Related, there was no way to know when there was a reply. 
        - #@ [[Sue Borchardt]] what if you posed it as:

‚§µÔ∏è

#Question [[Joel Chan]]?
        - #Reply [[Joel Chan]] Yeah, agreed it was really challenging, really wish there was a good way to get notifications. Queries could help for direct notifications (e.g., [[@[[Joel Chan]]]]), but I'd also like things like being notified when something is added to a thread I'm a part of.
            - Perhaps this could be done with some `roam/js`?
            - #Reply [[Chinarut]] good to see you here [[@[[Joel Chan]]]]! We have a need to manage state so I‚Äôm playing around with #open until something else shows up.

- #Chat [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] üéâ BOOM! I love it - looks like some new chat #Conventions underway.  üéâ
    - Thanks [[Beau Haan üìå]] for your work on this! I'm fine with adopting this.
        - Thanks [[Beau Haan üìå]] for your work on this! I'm fine with adopting this, it is a great idea
            - another thought about something cool here:
                - it lets a person "claim" a bullet quickly which is nice
                - #Reply [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]
                    - now I don't have to worry about someone else trying to type into this block at the same time as me which is still a problem in current-implementation multiplayer roam
        - I also really love this: (nested below)
            - {{embed:((cqWSTZM2v)) }}
        - hey [[@Beau Haan]] is it OK with you if I merge the instructions etc from old #Chat into new #Chat? 
I love the new CSS,  I'd also like to continue to promote the guidelines of chronological ordering and subject-hashtagging
        - Random question does it compound the arrows if we do a couple in a row?
            - #Reply #Chat [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]
            - hmm interesting
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I figured the `#Reply` would function as a direct response to the location of where it's used, which would keep the conversation understandable, but there is some know-how to see how it lines-up within the nesting
                - The implementation of #Question [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] would help with in-line questions or something akin to a `DM` and the `#Question` would be directed TO the person
                    - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] [[@Beau Haan]] are you envisioning that the question tag means "a question **for** ... person X"? or "a question __from__ ... person X"?
                - haha got it ... real time, seeing you type your answer right now. thanks.
                    - the other question in my mind is whether this would obviate the need for a [[@hey NAME]] convention.
                - There's still some clunkiness with how people are using the `#Reply` tag, but I suppose that's the "messiness" of all of this
                - I'm thinking about the solution to the `@` conundrum...
                    - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] yeah I came up with a CSS I like better - don't really like the current "make it pink" solution which I find somewhat obtrusive
                    - but there is a deeper functional issue that may be more important
                    - do we want to adhere to the "Roam Research" / Mat McGann protocol at all? (meaning: use "@" and "~" prefixes to name-links to "page" people and for them to then mark something as "seen") 
                        - Or replace it with hashtags?
                            - I need to ruminate on [[@[[Charles Farr]]]]'s idea of `[[nested[[brackets]]]]`
                            - I like the implementation, but might be a little too tricky for newer users
                    - the thing I like about prefixing the name links, is that right away you have an instant "notifications" page
                    - if we just used the #Question [[Person]] convention
                        - then we could instruct people on how to create a simple query that would "pull" any and all questions for them from anywhere in the database
                        - but I almost feel like there is a default very simple use for notifications, where the simplest case is literally, 'hey, Person A, have you seen this?' - i.e. you don't really even have a fully formulated question for them, you just want to "tag them in" to a discussion. 
                        - that was kind of what I was envisioning for [[@hey person]] convention.
                            - What about the `[[@[[Name]]]]` idea? is that a viable solution?
                            - I like the current `[[@Name]]` workflow, because it's simple and intuitive to how we use other apps already
                        - I bet there are javascript solutions to this that might help - meanwhile, wondering if we should just pick one of the two, and run with it. I like Charles' idea too. 
                        - [[@[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]]
                        - interestingly, the CSS doesn't care which one you use
                        - hmmm ... not sure yet which i prefer. OK then. 
                            - Confirming that it IS filterable... only draw-back is the learning of this "convention" for newer users
                            - Let me think... hmm...
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2Fg5B7SAOHiZ.png?alt=media&token=c7574dba-138a-427a-9a07-19a84ea26df5)
                            - #@ [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] What do you think? This could work?
                            - {{[[DONE]]}} #@ [[Beau Haan üìå]] Testing maybe the toggling function of TODO's might hold the answer?
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I think the idea is to continue the threading with `#Reply` and keeping the `#Chat` at the parent block level
        - As for "merge the instructions etc AND continue to promote the guidelines of chronological ordering and subject-hashtagging"[*](((xb654Eutm))) - I'm on-board!
        - I just hope the convention helps people see how threading works within [[Roam]]
    - #Reply[[Tony Tong]] [[@[[Beau Haan]]]] [[@[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]] Can we have some example queries pulling pulling your messages once the new [[Chat guidelines]] is established? 
        - Maybe example query with various level?
            - a query that pulls all DM @
            - a query that pulls all threads that you are involved in 
                - "#Reply [[Joel Chan]] Yeah, agreed it was really challenging, really wish there was a good way to get notifications. Queries could help for direct notifications (e.g., [[@[[Joel Chan]]]]), but I'd also like things like being notified when something is added to a thread I'm a part of."
            - the above 2 plus the ability to filter out read messages
- #Chat [[Kate Foy üå±]]
    - One of the first things I learned as an undergrad was that defining my terms at the outset when writing essays was not a bad thing for writer and reader; it's a lesson which has stood me in good stead since. I'm finding the terminology associated with "smart-note" taking to be increasingly confusing the more popular it becomes (check out the "digital gardeners" out there üå±). Whilst I believe there should be space to create one's own - perhaps eccentric - methodology of note-taking (stepping in Luhmann's shoes) there are good reasons (consistency/understanding etc.) as we examine the book to come to an appreciation of how [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] uses the terminology. Terms that I'd like to pin down for clarity of thought: "fleeting" cf. "highlights'; "literature notes" cf. "seedlings"; "permanent notes"/"Evergreens" cf. "zettels" etc. There are others too, but these are the ones I'm bumping on. Sidebar: the parallel with the natural world (a la [[Steven Johnson]]) continues. Cheers! 
        - [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] #Chat What academic area did you study in? Im a history undergrad, and i similarly find defining terms at the start of essays helpful, but reading the book so far has somewhat challenged my previous thoughts on doing this. Maybe i should try and define the terms after i have written the final essay, rather than at the start of the essay writing process, so that the definitions i use fit the insights i have gained along the way? I don't really know haha
            - My Majors were English Lit and History. Lots of reading and writing! I find not doing so - i.e., defining terms or at least being clear what you mean by a term at the outset of the writing phase - is problematical. There are very clear directives in Ahren's book (among lots) about the power of writing in order to clarify your thinking. What about starting there? 
                - Ah good to hear, and yes it is lots of reading and writing. I have similar problems if i don't define things as i then often spiral off into waffling, rather than focussed writing. 
- [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] 
    - Has anyone else got the problem that they don't write fleeting notes? What ive written in the past as "fleeting notes", are actually way too detailed and developed, meaning that I try and jump straight to the final product, rather than going through the stages of the process that Ahrens lays out. #Chat
        - #Chat[[Siva Arunagiri]] here, #Reply [[@Joshua Gerald Butler]] I tend to do that as well more often. But after reading [[How to Take Smart Notes]] what I realise is that when you take fleeting notes and let it digest for a while, we get more insight into what we have captured. So a structured writing is generally much better I guess. 
            - [[Michael Nieman]]one thing i"m confused about is whether "fleeting notes" can or are not supposed to contain quoted excerpts from the actual material (book in this case). I tend to excerpt, but is that lazy, or will it be helpful if I add my own gloss?
            - #Chat [[Joshua Gerald Butler]]  #Reply[[Siva Arunagiri]], I think i probably need to try and take the pressure off myself to write "perfect" notes, and instead just try getting all the ideas out of my head, and then later separate the wheat from the chaff.
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I really think the first two steps are very idiosyncratic to each individual
                    - For instance, I prefer to just voice-memo my thoughts and ideas into [[Otter.ai]] and then make sure the `Title` contains the relevant source and then I'm still able to listen back to the initial insight within context of when and what I was thinking 
                    - I haven't lost any contextual idea/insight, but if anything I've added the time to let the idea/insight ruminate, but YMMV
                    - #Chat[[Joshua Gerald Butler]] Yeah, perhaps i need to try and focus on the spirit of the book, rather than trying to focus on copying the exact workflow he proposes
                        - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I think it's important to remember that we're all here to help too, so I wouldn't get frustrated at all, but if you have any questions, just pose it to us on the [[Daily Notes]] like you just did--as you move forward!
        - #Reply [[Dan Allosso]] I'm having a similar conversation with myself, about what types of notes I'm going to put in Roam. My thought at this point is that I'll take what I think people would call "fleeting notes" in the app I'm using to process the content I'm working on (Walling for video, MarginNote3 for pdf or ebook text, Airr for podcasts, and the margins of books for old-fashioned paper -- or Drafts if I don't own the book!). Then I'll begin the process in Roam with "literature notes" and continue toward permanent. But, I'm new to these apps (though not this process) and still developing a workflow, so I may change my mind.
        - #Reply [[Sebastian Pech]] I mostly take literature notes only, though it depends on what I'm reading. If it's a scientific paper, I take fleeting notes eg. in form of annotations in the margin or highlights which help me think about the content. But I never keep those, I rather process instantly and file the resulting literature notes.
    - #Chat [[Thomas B.]] -> #Reply [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] I don't think it's a problem that you write these great and detailed notes, if they're popping in your head, don't suppress those because 'the process says so'! However, if you're now ignoring those less well-formed ideas, it might be helpful to try and capture those too.
        - As S√∂nke says:  __If your thoughts are already sorted and you have the time, you can skip this step and write your idea directly down as a proper, permanent note for your slip-box. __[*]()
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] Hey [[Thomas B.]] I completely agree, and [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] you could even add a secondary step called an #[[Intermediary Notes]] where you can have a running list of ideas that haven't found a proper place between [[Literature Notes]] and [[Permanent Notes]]
                - ps. [[Thomas B.]] I also love that you used `Replace with‚Üí text and alias` ÔøΩ
                    - ÔøΩ#Chat[[Joshua Gerald Butler]] - #Reply[[Thomas B.]] and #Reply [[@Beau Haan]]
                        - Thank you both for your thinking and encouragement! Definitely thinking about using the idea of #[[Intermediary Notes]] for the running list of homeless thoughts.
                            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] [[@Joshua Gerald Butler]] I was told to think of them as building blocks, which is very apropos, and they can be used as a place for the [[Zettelkasten]] to be continuously fed new ideas that you'd want to explore. It also leaves the possibility of thoughts that just haven't found the perfect placement, yet.
                            - The only thing I would add, would be that IF they are #[[Intermediary Notes]] than you would have a solid #Firewall between those ideas and your [[Zettelkasten]]'s `((Block References))` -- this is to prevent the "dialogue" that you have created from becoming dissonant.
        - #Chat [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] #Reply[[Jason Kleinberg üéª]]
            - Just this morning I followed a train of thought I had while reading chapter twelve. __A simple way to look at creativity: the discovery of connections between unrelated thoughts.__ I went on to write a few permanent notes about this in my own graph.
But wait! Am I getting ahead of where I'm supposed to be? Shouldn't I first finish the book? 
I don't know. It certainly is slowing down my reading (and I'm already slow). But wandering down this path, dipping my toe (gross expression) in zetteling, I feel the book and the smart note process are slowly starting to sink in.
                - #Reply [[Dan Allosso]] LOL! I've been rather unsuccessful trying to "get all the s##t in one sock" while "drinking from a firehose" -- not sure what you get when you mix those metaphors. But I've started trying to make notes when I have ideas with the idea that it's easier to edit something I got 60% right then it is to remember something so I can get it 100% on the first go.   
- [[Thomas B.]]
    - Is there a recording of the Zoom call for [[Book Club Live Session 1]]?
        - #Question [[Matt McKinlay]]
- #Question [[Mike Kramer]]  What are people's thoughts about sect. 12.2 Making Smart Connections (making links between permanent notes) in either single- or [[multiplayer]] mode?
    - I thought that this was a weakness in [[Roam Book Club]] ver. 1.
        - I am currently speculating that it's a question of how much work do I want to do up-front, vs how much do I want to do later when I have a specific project in mind
            - The lowest up-front cost seems to be tagging. And, already, we have tons of tags in this database. 
                - The question is: How much utility does tagging provide when I want to retrieve notes? 
            - My experience was that I, and most others, were primarily linking notes via the block labeled "Related Claims." 
                - This creates some additional work up-front, but the cost is relatively low.
                    - The question is: One year later--or maybe even one day later--will I remember why, and in what way, all those claims were related?
            - A costlier practice would be to state explicitly __how__ claims are related. 
                - are they both assumptions (evidence) in an argument that leads to a conclusion?
                    - silly example: (where I have used plus signs "+" instead of brackets "[")
                        - premise: ++Luhmann used a Zettelkasten and he was both prolific and successful++
                        - premise: ++Luhmann said that his use of a Zettelkasten was the reason that he was both prolific and successful++
                        - premise: ++Ahrens said that Luhmann's use of a Zettelkasten was the reason that he was both prolific and successful++
                        - conclusion: ++if anyone uses a Zettelkasten they will become both prolific and successful++
                        - conclusion: ++if I use a Zettelkasten I will become both prolific and successful++
                - does one imply the other?
                - this is obviously a lot more work and, as [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] states, some texts will require a lot more intensive processing than others. 
                    - but in the context of the [[Roam Book Club]] I am assuming we want to have a least moderate levels of processing intensity in order to test the system's limits
                - I thought that [[@Matthew McKinlay]] was moving in this direction in [[Roam Book Club]] ver. 1 with his book map.
                    - But I do not believe that he ever integrated [[Permanent Notes]] into the map. 
                        - I think that it would have been supremely difficult to do that, and very likely not worth the effort.
            - This list is, clearly, by no means exhaustive. Feel free to post other methods here.
    - #Reply [[Charles Farr]] [[@Mike Kramer]]
        - I would agree that linking is very difficult but also very important. I am trying to think of a good way to do this, but each method requires some significant manual work.
            - A few approaches I can think of...
                - To link very similar notes, e.g., zettels that are very closely related in either their claim of question, linking via reference materials could be very useful.
                    - Because we have an entire copy of __How to Take Smart Notes__ in the graph, we can tie ideas directly to the text and see what others have taken from similar passages. This is a good starting point for looking at related zettels
                - To link notes that are related but not necessarily similar, a process could be helpful to identify zettels with some degree of overlap... Once we align on  standardized [[Conventions]] for use of the #zettel phrase and for the format of individual zettel pages, a set of queries and an accompanying process could be a useful to help users search
                    - For instance a query structure such as this: `{{[[query]]: {and: [[zettel]] {or: [[Zettelkasten]] [[Folgezettel]] [[conventions]] [[Conventions]] }  }}}` would in theory surface all zettels related to Zettelkasten & other related terms
                    - For any zettel that a user grabs, a simple convention to designed to cite it would be very useful. We could a set of tags, such as #building-on, #in-reference-to, #in-response-to, #counterpoint, etc. 
                        - Very similar to what you proposed here! "premise: ++Luhmann used a Zettelkasten and he was both prolific and successful++"
            - To your earlier point though, all of this requires some level of effort...
- #Chat [[Dan Allosso]] 09:02 CST
    - Reading Group people seem to be putting up a lot of block quotes of long passages of Ahrens‚Äô text. I‚Äôm seeing not only the text reproduced for readers who don‚Äôt have digital versions of the book, but people copying big chunks into their own pages, highlighting those passages, and then commenting on them. I‚Äôm not sure I see the point of this, in two ways.
        - First, the way Ahrens describes Luhmann‚Äôs zettelkasten workflow, it doesn‚Äôt sound like this was the way Luhmann used his slipboxes. I haven‚Äôt read the source texts yet, (I should find Luhmann‚Äôs 1987 text Ahrens mentions), but the sense I get is that he had a box for bibliographic references with short descriptions of the text, and then he had his ‚Äúpermanent notes‚Äù box where he was working with his own interpretations of the ideas he was picking up in these sources.
        - I think it‚Äôs fair to say that any source is going to have more in it than I as a reader am going to take out of it. This is because even if I try to be a ‚Äúblank slate‚Äù (and in most cases I‚Äôm not even convinced that that‚Äôs the reading state I should be going for) I am reading with a question or a thought in my mind. So I‚Äôm finding information or I‚Äôm drawn to ideas and arguments that relate to my interest. That‚Äôs why all the people who highlight and comment on the text in the social graph are going to have slightly different things to say, and why it‚Äôs going to be interesting. It‚Äôs also why I sometimes get something different out of a source when I return to it ‚Äî especially if my understanding of a topic has changed in the intervening time. I‚Äôve had this experience recently when I‚Äôve reviewed the notes I made very early in my History grad school career or even earlier. 
        - I should mention that I‚Äôm not that interested in what Luhmann said about the slipbox because I care deeply about ‚Äúgetting it right‚Äù or emulating the master. I want to see the workflow he was effective with, and then consider whether it would work for me. I‚Äôm not going to get involved in any arguments about what Luhmann meant or whether people are following his teachings correctly. 
        - But my second reason for questioning the efficacy of big block quotes is I‚Äôm not convinced that Roam Research is the ideal place to be storing the media I‚Äôm processing. So far (and I have to keep repeating, this is less than a month for me), it seems Roam is brilliant at manipulating hypertext. I haven‚Äôt reached a critical mass in my graph yet, and I haven‚Äôt settled on a routine for integrating notes and reviewing and connecting ideas. But it seems like the bidirectional links will be very helpful. And I suspect the ‚Äúblock quotes‚Äù that are built into Roam will be very valuable in this linking process, although I‚Äôm not that familiar with them yet. 
        - But I don‚Äôt think the internal block-quoting process is analogous to grabbing huge hunks of outside texts and bringing them into Roam. As I understand Roam‚Äôs block quotes, they‚Äôre a way of referring to other sections of the graph without the need to cut and paste. Sort of a Ted Nelsonesque idea where there‚Äôs only one instance of anything, and then links elsewhere rather than copies. I value having permanent access to the sources I quote, which is why I was downloading PDFs of articles and appending them too my Endnote or Zotero bibliographies, even before I started using Evernote or MarginNote 3. But I don‚Äôt want to have many copies. I want one.
        - Which brings me back to the question of where to store that one. And at this moment, it doesn‚Äôt seem to me like Roam is the ideal place. Especially since an increasing percentage of the content I‚Äôm processing is multimedia rather than just print. In this new environment, a very text-focused tool like Roam is better for writing than curating the content I want to process. Why not use a variety of tools that are each tuned to be best at these different tasks?
    - #Reply [[[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]] yeah I noticed this as a friction-point, too!
        - my thought on this is that yes, if we keep an annotation free-"copy", as our group "source" (for this graph at least) which means that if we block reference it in its current form, it will mean that:
            - many of those blocks will be long, probably unwieldy passages ---
            - because the source text is not fully broken down
            - my working hypothesis is that "blocks" themselves should be the "atomic units of thought"
            - but the book in its shared form in this database is not in that form
        - I had an idea on this though
            -  what if we adopted a practice of block-referencing with asterisk in our own notes
                - #Reply[[Tony Tong]]
                    - I was trying exactly this! "I found that using text and alias when [[block reference]] works better for me as it allow me to highlight on sentences of a block, providing more accurate context for my notes. "
            - then individuals could pull out shorter "pieces" of the original work as inline references
            - that might sound a little confusing, I'll come back with an example, later
        - I agree with you about the broad scope of this as one of the problems we face though - the book itself is not written in Zettels, it's written in paragraphs and pages - and those don't map into what we are trying to do.
            - #Reply [[Mike Kramer]] I agree. And, furthermore, even if a book were written in Zettels, I think that there is a strong case to be made, going even beyond the case that [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] makes, that we would still want to translate into our own words only those Zettels that we wanted.
    - #Chat [[Thomas B.]] #Reply [[Dan Allosso]]
        - I'm not sure I understand your argument. Feel like you're saying [here](((0osfvWtGu))) that using the block quotes actually is beneficial, since the source text contains so much more and it allows us to compare everyone's interpretation. 
        - Also, I agree with you, that normally I wouldn't import whole articles into my private graph and then use these block quotes to references whole arguments. Rather I would just link to the original article and jot down my own thoughts on it. Maybe specifically quote some passages if I feel like it. 
        - However, since we have the whole text of the book in this graph anyway and it is a separate graph from my personal one, I'm enjoying the low barrier of reading the text and just ctrl-dragging any passage that stirs up any thought and write down my thoughts indented beneath it. I think this is a valid workflow for the [[Fleeting Notes]] stage. 
        - However, to make the [[literature notes]] or [[Permanent Notes]], as you and [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] say, it makes sense to be much more restrictive with how much you're quoting, and focus more on reformulating what's written in your own words and maybe just adding a link to the source material. 
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] How about just `Alt-Dragging` the block, but then hovering over the `((block reference))` and `Replace with‚Üí text and alias` -- shortening the quoted block to just the highlight that's relevant to one's own personal #[[Fleeting Notes]]? 
                - #Reply [[Dan Allosso]] Yes! This is cool and it's __super helpful__ to have power users here who can demonstrate and model these techniques!
            - #Reply [[Matt McKinlay]] You can also highlight any sentence in a block, and then type double parentheses and it will give option of 'create as block below' which will extract that sentence and make it it's own block nested under the paragraph. "For example I will record a gif below." And I will only extract one sentence from this block.
                - For example I will record a gif below.

        - I feel like there's a sense of clutter with how people are currently `nesting` their thoughts, but I don't think that's necessarily something bad, since it's part of the learning process--but also a absolute reason why [[Roam]] is a powerful tool since it can solve problems __"on-the-fly"__ even at a massive scale!
- #Reply [[Charles Farr]] [[@[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]] + [[@Mike Kramer]] + [[@[[Dan Allosso]]]]
    - #Reply [[Charles Farr]] #@ [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] 
    - I just wanted to share an example of how I was handling this yesterday as I was reading and taking notes.
        - My personal approach is to highlight text and react to it. Sometimes I will add a note on my kindle, other times I will just pull it in using [[ReadWise]] and the process it through into some higher level note.
            - But in this graph, because we have the source text, I just copied the quote over and linked it using an [[alias]] to the source text. See here: ""as no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument." [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))"
            - I see that [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] already proposed doing just this!
                - " what if we adopted a practice of block-referencing with asterisk in our own notes"
                - #Reply [[Tony Tong]] yeah I also tried this technique "I found that using text and alias when [[block reference]] works better for me as it allow me to highlight on sentences of a block, providing more accurate context for my notes. "
                - #sub #Reply [[Michael Nieman]] new to Roam and still don't understand what is meant by "block referencing." Also where can I find the conventions for "daily notes" so I don't step on toes? Are we supposed to place notes here about the book itself or just our process? Thx
                    - #Reply [[Charles Farr]] [[@[[Michael Nieman]]]]
                        - Hi Michael! Typing while dialing potential voters, so bear with me if I step away for a second
                        - Each block (or bullet or set of bullets) has a unique hashcode associated with it. This block's is `((TYQObqxiU))`.
                            - You can make a block reference by dragging a block while holding the `ctrl` key, or you can right click on the bullet and select "Copy Block Reference" and then past that wherever you what to reference said block. I'm going to reference this block directly below as an example...
                                - "You can make a block reference by dragging a block while holding the `ctrl` key, or you can right click on the bullet and select "Copy Block Reference" and then past that wherever you what to reference said block. I'm going to reference this block directly below as an example..."
                        - So the power of [[block references]] is the ability to cite any block anywhere else in the graph!
                            - Additionally, when you click on a block reference, you can go to the original place of the block, or you have a few other cool features the manipulate the block.
                                - What we're discussing here is using the "Replace With" > "Alias" or "Text With Alias" commands, which allows you to cite / manipulate the text easily while maintaining a reference to the original block
                                - ok thank you sadly that is all pretty much Greek to me at this point. I will go back to reading the book
                                    - #Reply [[Charles Farr]] [[@[[Michael Nieman]]]] happy to do a live Roam Tour if it would be helpful!
            - I believe there is real value here as it allows us to tie together similar thoughts based on the underlying reference material.
                - While it depends on how we orient ourselves, if one of the goals is to build a generalized understanding of some concepts across all the book club in a [[Multiplayer Roam]] fashion, being able to tie similar thoughts together is critical to building towards higher-level concepts
                    - [[Andy Matuschak]] believes that building toward high level concepts should be one of the goals. I believe that doing so in [[Multiplayer Roam]] requires prioritizing discoverability and density. Using [[block references]] is so helpful in this regard!
            - One of the main questions I struggle with is to what extent to constantly interrupt my reading by taking notes, etc. Is it a good idea to plan to read a book twice, perhaps one time through resisting the temptation to take notes and highlight. Sometimes I feel like I may be missing something that  might come with deeper absorption 
- [[Charlie Mead]] - 05:43
    - Rereading [[Andy Matuschak]]'s [[Why books don't work]], and trying to consider the patterns within Roam that create the default actions and patterns of thought that are the same thing as doing what's necessary to understand.
    - For example, a book implicitly suggests: "read all the words on the first page, then repeat with the next, and so on." That, according to Matuschak, assumes a flawed cognitive model. Reading needs to be interleaved with metacognitive actions that help readers steer their own feedback loop.
    - Some [[[[Metacognition]] [[questions]]]]:
        - This idea reminds me of...
        - This point conflicts with...
        - I don't really understand how...
        - What questions should I be asking?
        - How should I summarize this?
        - What does it feel like to understand something?
        - Where are my blind spots?
        - What is my emotional connection to this content?
    - Is there a pattern to put those to use within Roam? Something like,
        - Set a 5-min {{[[POMO]]: 5}}
        - Read text + fleeting notes
        - On elapsed reading timer, set another {{[[POMO]]: 5}} to consider "Some [[[[Metacognition]] [[questions]]]]:"

        - Thanks for your work on a better chatting convention. My 2 cents:
            - The tag followed by **name** convention is a bit confusing since sometimes the name is your name and sometimes it is the person you would like to send to
                - I propose `#keyword[[My Name]]` or   `#keyword[[My Name]] @[[Their Name]]` all the time, including question
            - I am using a query to pull all my relevant chat as #@[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] described "then we could instruct people on how to create a simple query that would "pull" any and all questions for them from anywhere in the database"
                -  like so:
                    - "My chat::"
                - The challenge here, assuming everyone is strictly following the [[Chat guidelines]] is to differentiate new messages from read ones
                    - I know and tried "do we want to adhere to the "Roam Research" / Mat McGann protocol at all? (meaning: use "@" and "~" prefixes to name-links to "page" people and for them to then mark something as "seen") " but it has been difficult and has side effects
                        - if anyone type nested in ~ block, a query filtering out seen ~ messages will ignore those
                    - using [[David Vargas]] query tool could help
                    - #@ [[Joel Chan]] I feel the same "#Reply [[Joel Chan]] Yeah, agreed it was really challenging, really wish there was a good way to get notifications. Queries could help for direct notifications (e.g., [[@[[Joel Chan]]]]), but I'd also like things like being notified when something is added to a thread I'm a part of."
                        - Just to make it more accurate: the thread one is a part of = the nested blocks? Should we also consider sibling and even parent blocks? 
            - Regarding the use of @, I vote for `#@ [[Their Name]]` since it seems the simplest and will not create unnessary pages like the other methods
                - #Chat [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] in theory this idea is great, but there is a problem, which is that if they are two independent tags, e.g. `#@` and `[[name]]`, then the "query" function cannot be used to "find" only instances of the two of them together IN THE SAME BLOCK;
                    - the query function "searches" an entire breadcrumb trail
                    - so there's no way to "surface" only when they happen to be next to each other
                        - #Chat [[Tony Tong]] indeed! Then my vote would go to `[[@[[Their Name]]]]` since it could make a query shorter (by not searching for `[[@Their Name]]` + `[[Their Name]]`)
                    - in that sense, even though `# @` `# name` is simpler and more elegant, it runs into functional problems
                - #Question[[Tony Tong]] #@[[Beau Haan üìå]] Should we also have css for #[[~]] to mark as read? 
                    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I'm chatting with [[Cato Minor]] now about maybe somehow toggling {{[[TODO]]}} and {{[[DONE]]}} to make it happen, but it would mean a small `javascript` code, which is less than ideal, especially for newer members
                        - It seems that the limitation of having {{[[DONE]]}} and {{[[TODO]]}} accessible with pure `CSS` is something that [[Roam]] is capable of, but needs an ask from the team...

        - It would be really cool if with [[NLP]] after creating a block, there is a button that could suggest for similar/related blocks to link together

    - How do you handle [[Permanent Notes]] in Roam? Right now I kind of capture [[Fleeting Notes]] in my Daily Pages, while using specific pages for Permanent notes. 
        - However, when I later want to integrate new ideas, I don't know whether to just edit that page, and discard my old ideas. Or use the versioning options of Roam to make multiple versions of a block. Or to make a separate section at the bottom of the page with an 'Archive', where I copy older versions. Or make a note on my Daily pages with the #Page and #Archive and copy the old version of that page. I've experimented with all of those, but am not particularly happy with any of them so far. 
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I have $$1$$ Permanent Notes page, where the actual __dialogue__ happens with my [[Zettelkasten]]
        - I also tend to use [[Keyboard Maestro]] to automate changing #[[Fleeting Notes]] into #[[Intermediary Notes]] with a keystroke
        - And if the #[[Fleeting Notes]] has served it's purpose, reminded me, and I can let it go, I just tend to either delete the `#` or add a `#Reviewed` tag
        - #Reply [[Thomas B.]] Can you elaborate on your system? Do you make those in your Daily Notes, and do you add #[[Permanent Notes]]? Do you use a query to collect all of your #[[Permanent Notes]], or do you manually curate your collection?
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] [[~Thomas B.]] Exactly! Making use of the [[Daily Notes]] page creates a chronological aspect of [[Zettelkasten]] that is really maximized within [[Roam]]'s core technology. Basically, it's solved the problem of creating a UID (Unique ID) when creating a __nested sequence of notes__, also known as a [[Folgezettel]]
            - The query of `#Permanent Notes` is unnecessary because the `#Permanent Notes` page itself contains the __conversation__ as [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] talks about‚Üí 

__Just amassing notes in one place would not lead to anything other than a mass of notes. But he collected his notes in his slip-box in such a way that the collection became much more than the sum of its parts. His slip-box became his dialogue partner, main idea generator and productivity engine. It helped him to structure and develop his thoughts. And it was fun to work with‚Äìbecause it worked.__[*](((BjFRHwXXy)))
            - #Reply [[Thomas B.]] [[@[[Beau Haan üìå]]]] Yes, I can see the analogy of using the [[Daily Notes]] as the pieces of paper for the [[slip-box]]. However, as your amount of `#Permanent Notes` increases, wouldn't you need some kind of structure or index to prevent that page from becoming a way to start __'amassing notes in one place'__? Or is the option to filter with tags in the references of Roam in your experience sufficient for this?

It is the only program I know that really implements the principles behind Luhmann‚Äôs system and is at the same time simple and easy to use. It is free and available for different operating systems. You can download it from zettelkasten.danielluedecke.de (please consider sending a donation to the developer if you like it)."
    - #Question[[Joshua Gerald Butler]]
        - How is everyone creating their [[slip-box]] within Roam? Are you having one page within your roam graph that stores all your notes in one big storage, with each note defined by the tags on them?
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] You can also utilize the `[[Name/Space]]` capabilities within [[Roam]], so it doesn't clutter the [[Daily Notes]] page or [[Your Name]] page‚Üí 

ie. `[[Your Name/Permanent Notes]]`
