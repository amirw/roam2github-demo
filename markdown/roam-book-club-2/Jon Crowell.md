        - "Imagine now you are not the one who has to edit the rough draft and turn it into the final paper, but the one who has to prepare it. What would be helpful to achieve that quickly? It would certainly make things a lot easier if you already had everything you need right in front of you: The ideas, the arguments, the quotes, long developed passages, complete with bibliography and references. And not just readily available, but already in order, sorted by chapters that have descriptive headlines. Now that’s also a clear assignment. No worries about perfect sentences (someone else will take care of that), no worries about finding things and coming up with ideas (someone else already took care of that), you just focus on turning a string of ideas into a continuous text. Again, that is still serious work and you have to put some effort into it, if you want to make it great. You might spot a missing step in an argument and have to fill it, or you might want to rearrange some notes or leave something out that you regard as less relevant. But, again, this is not an overwhelming task and luckily, it doesn’t need to be perfect. No problem so far."

        - Goals
            - To slowly read through **How to Take Smart Notes**
            - To absorb the material, to flesh out key ideas with my own experiences and thoughts, and to adopt what works into my personal information gathering practice
            - To arm myself with a powerful method for creating interesting, useful, beautiful works
            - To tap into the collective thoughts of a community of people who are going through the same process, enriching my own understanding and helping me see things I would have completely missed on my own
            - To be more of a creator and less of a consumer
            - To get a sense of the hivemind potential of Roam
            - To learn new Roam tricks
