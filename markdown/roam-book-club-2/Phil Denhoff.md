    - [[Goals for Book Club]]
        - Interested to see what the #Roam community is like
        - Especially looking towards #talking in groups of 5-10? I want to learn how others take #Notes
            - It's the same reason I joined the #Roam #Slack!
        - Somewhat interested in #Zettelkasten. I think it's an __interesting__ method but doubtfully a __godsend__.
            - The best note taking method is one that you use. The second best one helps you remember stuff __right now__.
    - [[Questions]]
        - What's is [[Sönke Ahrens]] background? I know he's touted as a knowledgable person in the #roamcult and he's an academic; does he have a history of studying human note taking and information retention?
        - What are other sources of knowledge that might have more productive methods for taking notes?
            - what does productive look like?
        - In [[Book Club Live Session 1]], [[Sönke Ahrens]] said that he's "not sure" about handwriting versus typing since he's not an expert
            - Some research suggests handwriting is better for retention.
            - Personally, throughout my entire degree I hand wrote almost all my notes for exactly that reason; writing had less affordances for distraction and there is (some) research that suggests it is better for retention
            - For those that use an [[iPad]] and [hand write]([[handwriting]]) notes __into__ Roam, are they finding a super power? Is that a best-of-both-worlds situation, or is it limited to the same effectiveness as #typing into #Roam?
            - I'm on a real train of thought here that's diverged significantly from [[How to Take Smart Notes]]... but I think every step of it matters.
        - [[Matt McKinlay]] asks "Can I consistently establish a reading habit? "
            - He may address this in his thinking, but I think the question isn't just about [[reading]] but about [[understanding]] and, better yet, [[connection]].
                - I read somewhere recently (maybe [[Hacker News]]?) that "smarts are intelligence + facts"
                    - source:: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24957748
                - Just because you read doesn't mean you understand something. Your reading should have a goal.
                    - Yes, that includes "reading for pleasure". The goal is Pleasure.
                    - In reading for knowledge, you should be __reading quickly to satisfy a goal__.
                        - Maybe I should start asking, before I read an article or book, "what is my goal for this source?" Examples follow
                            - I want to get a sense of the history of the Roman Empire
                            - I want to get better tips for how to sleep better
                                - I want to understand the process of sleep
                                -
