- #Question   [[Jason Kleinberg ðŸŽ»]] How would you take and organize notes on your Zettlekasten __process__ and __workflow__?
    - While reading [Implementing Zettlekasten in Roam](https://www.roambrain.com/implementing-zettelkasten-in-roam/) I took a literature describing (in my own words) the author's personal process of zettling. Tips and technique.
    - Because I'm taking a note about an article on note-taking, in this case, it seems to qualify as a literature note. 
    - But if I was reading an article about something unrelated to Zettlekasten, like nutrition, and I happened to have an insight on how I could tweak my note-taking system, how would this note be organized?
        - #Reply-from [[Denise Todd]] to [[Jason Kleinberg ðŸŽ»]] My working method is to put the unrelated thought in its own block with the tag #Question with the intention of reviewing the #Question page every week to think more about those thoughts and process them appropriately. If you determine an alternative method, I'd be interested in hearing it. Thanks.  
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] This is interesting, because I think there's so much confusion about how to do this whole thing--correctly. But from my experience, it's about solving the problems as they arise, and having [[Roam]]'s capacity to do just that as the saving grace
            1. Especially in the first several permanent notes, the [top-level branches](((sqgGzPGYL))) of my [[Zettelkasten]] are typically the broader topics (not always), but they always relate to what I'm thinking about and what I want to know more about

            2. There's almost a required awareness of being conscious of what I'm reading, because what I'm reading is meant to be related to what I've already written. This interview with [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] illuminates that pretty clearly in this clip (timestamped)

        1. [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] (about nine months) and honestly this is the biggest thing for me: 


            - fully accepting the difference between artificial intelligence and augmented intelligence, and fully realizing that zetteling is __assistive__ - it is __not__ a recreation, replacement, or a simulation of the thinking process itself ...

this has lots of downstream consequences, in my practice, for how the Zettel works for me

it's become a continuous re-iteration of "is this useful/meaningful for me" - both in terms of what I am reading and taking notes on at any given time, and also in the constantly-evolving note-taking process that I am developing. continually asking myself that question ... and modifying my process, bit-by-bit.

in a sense it's also realizing there is no final "target" here. There is no perfection of a Zettel system - only more and more useful refinements, built on the top of a few key elements.

when did this really "click"? honestly, I think it was in this book club, during the second (for me) read-through of Soenke's book - second time the charm I guess.
                - Re: "assistive" tech -- reminded of this essay [[~[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]]  https://www.wired.com/2014/10/all-technology-is-assistive/
                    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] super interesting! thank you. I had no idea that the "Eames chair" designers also made a field splint - cool background story
                        - also, reminds me of something I think [[Conor White-Sullivan]] said at one point - that Roam may exist partly because of his own [[ADHD]] tendencies, but that principles that apply to assisting people with ADHD also end up giving leverage to people anywhere on an attentional spectrum.
        2. [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] I signed up for [[Roam]]'s #Believer plan on [[July 8th, 2020]] and began reading [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] book around that same time too.
            - After reading through the book twice, I felt like I was missing the human connection of understanding what the hell [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] meant, because of the broadness of the system, especially with how to implement a [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam]]
            - So I signed up for a 1-on-1 coaching session with him on [[August 19th, 2020]] -- primarily because I'm a recovering drug addict, and we always know that when you want the good shit... you go to the source #PureShit #NothingCut
            - And after months of conceptually attempting to figure out what the hell this system was, I finally committed to just fucking doing it, on [[September 2nd, 2020]], but only after I found an accountability partner since I would be going down a path of pretty much absolute uncertainty... (I understood that I couldn't rely on other's way of doing it, because of the personal nature of a [[Zettelkasten]])
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FHfYGLyivaJ.png?alt=media&token=7553b58b-d1a8-4d6c-a3c2-927493a5f103)
            - As I began, I started seeing the difficulty immediately, because I came to understand that some things just worked better within [[Roam]] and the technology that this tool has embedded in it's core
            - But because ALL of the videos were attempting to mimic and duplicate the analog system in [[Roam]], I ventured in integrating the core concepts of [[Zettelkasten]] with the fundamentals of [[Roam]]
            - It became evident rather quickly, that certain things like the `#` the `[[]]` and the `(())` would become incredibly powerful in translating the system inside of [[Roam]]
            - I began everything inside of the `Daily Notes` page because I also wanted to incorporate the UID or timestamp that others have attempted to use as a way to demarcate the [[Zettelkasten]]'s original `1`, `1a`, `1a1` branching system
            - Then I realized that: 1) I didn't need the traditional numbering system because of the dual functions of the `#` and how it would link to the `[[]]` page but also how it semantically looks and feels like a containing element typically used in other apps (it's a way to box something, categorizing things)
            - As I went along, I continued to listen to all of the [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] interviews available, also ruminating on the 1-on-1 coaching session, and I would literally go to sleep listening of [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s system coming to life in my dreams~ #Obsession
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FLOrvpZyD3G.png?alt=media&token=37a069d6-b3db-488f-a811-7c8ffe6f669e)
            - Once I started hitting my stride, I started having faith that doing this inside of [[Roam]] might have just been a stroke of genius, because there was something about how I would nest things, that would make things just work--at the block level, nested, on the Daily Notes page
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2F5ydHBciy7c.png?alt=media&token=d9d8e490-a95d-4648-ad39-efdd198b6894)
            - I began getting incredibly excited, because I had also been listening to a shit-ton of World Science Festival lectures online, and how when they first discovered the [[Higgs Boson]] at [[CERN]]. They were all convinced that they fucked up somewhere along the line, so spent months attempting to disprove, or break what they saw.
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2F9qMy6uNde-.png?alt=media&token=7befd01d-204d-4c46-ad38-43104473565e)
            - It was at this point that I scheduled a follow-up coaching session with [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] to illuminate what I had discovered on [[October 26th, 2020]] and I was blown away by his response. Particularly, because I think we both saw over the course of that hour-long meeting that that hunch that I had about implementing the [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam]] was truly something special... the tool finally caught up with the system.
                - {{[[youtube]]: https://youtu.be/iBzIoh4VIz4}}
            - And where I am currently, the biggest breakthroughs have been from actually hosting these [[Meetup]]s and giving encouragement to others to trust in the process. It's messy, it's uncharted territory, but the community within this #roamcult provides the backbone to walk through the misty fog~
            - There's something powerful about teaching something, albeit the little bit that I have been able to ascertain, over this brief time, that has provided me huge leaps in how I think about [[Zettelkasten]] and for that I am eternally grateful! âœ¨
- #[[chat]][[Mike Kramer]] I took notes on the [[Sonke Ahrens Interview]], paying particular attention to how to create relationships among ideas in Roam. That discussion begins around time 27:00 [here](https://us02web.zoom.us/rec/play/zYfGrF-AHTDstjL-KcNgFdoYNFNJjedhpNEiRO6vE0Bsqfsn8RhhfmW1hwxRWbvdPcoZ7CodDAvKmXCI.kqj_pJiskYQhSKCY?continueMode=true). I have attempted to summarize what I interpreted him to be saying, using the idea that a network consists of a collection of nodes, and connections, or relations, among those nodes. 
    - "{{table:}}"
        - "**Link description**"
            - "**Node type**"

        - "single-concept [[tag]]"
            - "page"
                - "all nodes are similar to each other along the dimension defined by the single-concept tag"

    - "Comments:"
        - "The intra-page link seems to violate the standardization principle that the containerization story illustrated. I want to automate the structure of my system so that each thought that can stand on its own is represented by a permanent note. I do not want to have to decide, before writing a note, if I should make it one note with multiple sub-ideas as blocks, or multiple notes. "
        - "The distinction between the [[tag]] and the cluster strikes me more as a difference of degree rather than of kind."
        - "If I were to modify my system according to the previous two comments, I would end up with two kinds of links:"
            - "a combination of tag and cluster"
                - "[this example](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/%C2%A7Corporate_research_lab_practices) from [[Andy Matuschak]]"
            - "inter-page"
                - "in [this example](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zVFGpprS64TzmKGNzGxq9FiCDnAnCPwRU5T) from [[Andy Matuschak]], the relations among the nodes are temporal, not logical."
        - "[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] has been nudging us to create some kind of uniform nomenclature to distinguish the types of links. The names that I have used here are not particularly helpful. First, I think we need to test whether this taxonomy makes sense. Second, if it does, I am sure we could come up with more mellifluous names."
