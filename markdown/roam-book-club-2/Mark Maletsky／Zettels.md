        - #[[Literature Notes]]  Zettelkasting will initially require effort and work on my my part, however once this method becomes natural when reading, the benefits will be rewarding and refreshing, and much more beneficial.
            - Zettelkasting should become a method for reading that minimizes perceived effort and be comes rewarding.
            - This process may initially take some effort and introspection in order to change lifelong habits and this may be painful or seem tedious at first.
            - The rewards of learning this new system should make it something that will seem natural and effortless and ultimately, more meaningful and useful.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]]  The world is a state of disorder and increased randomness. Living involves work which takes energy. However, exercise and reading, though taking a conscious effort, can be energizing and invigorating.

- fleeting note - exergonic reaction - need to add energy
- fleeting note - endergonic reaction - releases energy
- literature note - Work does not always have to take energy to do, but sometimes, if done properly, it can actually refresh one or even energize one. 
- literature note - This would be the goal of Zettelkasting - to perform work but become energized in the process and want to do even more.
- Zettel - Zettelkasting should be fun and make you feel energized and anxious to continue and explore.
