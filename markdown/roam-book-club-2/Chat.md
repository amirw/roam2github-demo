- ### Welcome to the page that lets you view, sort, and filter chats!
- The utility of this page is mostly in its **linked references** below, which serve as a kind of **"master map"** to all of the "chats" that have happened in this database. 
    - You can filter and sort your view of those chats to find out more about
        - a) recent conversations that occurred on "daily notes" pages (to see these, sort by 'Daily Note Descending', the bottom option in the "sort" menu, to see most recent first)
        - b) recent conversations that you were in (filter by your name)
        - c) recent conversations on topics of interest (filter by the subject hashtags in the chat)
    - ^^NOTE^^ that to turn on the "sort" capacity (which is added via a JavaScript plugin from [[David Vargas]]), you will need to -
        1. visit this page: [[roam/js]]
        2. click the red button that says "Yes, I know what I'm doing" under the javascript that is described as David Vargas' (its number is one) in order to turn on the JavaScript
        3. then, refresh the graph with the little circley-arrow thing on your browser.
- please see: [[Chat guidelines]]  for some tips on the "chat" conventions that we are developing.
