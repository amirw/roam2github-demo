    - How to take Smart Notes by Sonke Ahrens
    - **Note sequences** - notes that are quite densely connected - eg "in contradiction to the previous idea" I would write these within one note (in Roam) One info in each block. Distinguish between different kinds of links between blocks or pages. If I # something this is a link to like an index entry. These are different to links to more descriptive notes. They might become entry points or clusters. I would treat these differently to index / collection pages. This is main difference to paper versions or other apps that don't have the block reference system.

    - "Unfortunately, even universities try to turn students into planners. Sure, planning will get you through your exams if you stick to them and push through. But it will not make you an expert in the art of learning/ writing/ note-taking (there is research on that: cf. Chapter 1.3). Planners are also unlikely to continue with their studies after they finish their examinations. They are rather glad it is over. Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas. The fact that you invested in this book tells me that you would rather be an expert than a planner."
        - Write some of my commentary on the block.
