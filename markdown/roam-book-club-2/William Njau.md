                    - When you look at video games. Feedback loops are normally implemented in a very immediate way that makes it immediately evident about where you went wrong
                    - It also reminds me of the notion of 'deep' or 'deliberate' practise by [[Daniel Coyle]] where  the emphasis is on focusing on very tiny aspects to practise on for long periods of time while getting immediate feedback that you are doing it right
                    - Somehow, I get the feeling that the feedback loop is tied to the length of time within it is given. The longer it takes to get feedback, the more likely it will be tied to an external validation process, while the shorter it takes to get feedback, the more likely it is that it is tied to the learning process and therefore internal.
                    - Additionally, giving feedback on what is being done leads to growth, while giving feedback on an outcome or who someone is likely to lead to stagnation.

                    - Glad he mentioned this because it's definately what I was thinking while reading the previous paragraphs
                        - The Zeigarnik effect doesn't have to be something negative
                    - This also supports the idea that I think it would be more useful to write some zettels as questions as opposed to declarative or conclusive statements
                    - Also funny that he mentions how "we often find the answer to a question in rather casual situation" thus making it even more difficult to [quickly capture those thoughts as fleeting notes or literature notes](((LvrdKgfHG)))

                    - A meaningful way to put things in your own words, while taking literature notes or fleeting notes is to think of it as having a conversation with someone.

            - "**What ideas resonate with you from the book**"
                - I've only read the [[Introduction]] so far but the #idea that resonated with me so far was on:

                    - Notes that you take if something happens to resonate with you
                - "How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method."
                    - I notice if I agree or disagree with something, or something surprises me then I take a note on it
                - "What is the value of fleeting notes?  For this book, and for previous books you have read? "
                    - To be synthesized and repurposed into something useful
    - [[November 15th, 2020]]
        - "Define a literature note in your own words."
            - Synthesis of what you have read
        - "How do you take literature notes? Discuss your method."
            - I try to relate what I am reading to what I have read before and compare
            - I then look for 'gaps' what I feel had not been addressed and build from there
        - "Have you found value in taking literature notes already?"
            - So far I have been able to see relationships between different ideas and different authors
        - "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?"
            - Being able to create something that is new and unique
                - Coming up with something in my own words is a challange
        - "Describe any enlightening moments you had while taking literature notes."
            - Just seeing connections between different ideas. How different authors can be writting something on different topics but essentially saying the same thing

        - "Reflect on the book.  What are you impressions? "
            - It has given me clarity  on my note taking process and made me realise that a lot of what I used to have were merely #[[Fleeting Notes]] and hardly #[[Literature Notes]] or #[[Permanent Notes]]
        - "Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way? "
            - Yes, still  brought in more clarity to my note taking process
        - "Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? "
            - It hasn't been easy and I think that is largely attributable to me having to focus on other things as well
            - But while taking down my notes the process has been rather enjoyable to a point where time doesn't seem to matter
        - "How is your progress towards your initial goals? Or have they changed?"
        - "Explore the concept of permanent notes/zettels."
            - "#[[Literature Notes]] on taking #[[Permanent Notes]]"
                - Therefore, I think that taking #[[Permanent Notes]] can be viewed as a three-step reasoning process that involves evaluating the relationship between ideas so as to identify a gap, intervening to propose a way to fill the gap, and finally evaluating the solution and underlying assumptions in filling the gap so as to create understanding.

                        - I have gained a new perspective on note taking and realized that how I was approaching note taking before was highly flawed and unsustainable.
                        - I have also realized that the idea of smart note taking is something that can be applied across different activities such as cooking, teaching e.t.c
                    - "Are there any additions to the process described in the book?"
                        - Not at the moment but I believe that this will emerge as I continue to synthesize and make permanent notes on what I have understood from the book.
                    - "Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten?"
                        - I think that's its current limitation is that it does not immediately lend itself non academic writing yet reading through the book I felt that 
                            - The system of Zettelkasten is something that can be applied across different processes and activities like:
                                - teaching
                                - cooking
