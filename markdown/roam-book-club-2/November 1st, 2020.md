    - [[Live Session Notes]]
        - [[Breakout 1]]
            - Swapnil (New York) - software engineering
            - Categorisation problem -> documentation problem in software development
            - [[Questions for SÃ¶nke]]
                - Evergreens/ zettels: how large, how complex is ideal; guidelines?
        - [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] The Author
            - Experiment
            - It was a procrastination project
            - Like systems theory
            - Nickolas Leumens?
            - Leverage for higher education
            - Interdisciplinary way to connect ideas
            - [[Question]] Benefits of reading and taking notes in this style? In a rigorous way
                - Making connections between ideas that are new and old an those that are already forgotten. Avoid floating on new ideas.
                - 2 notes at different stages: I thought this was the same idea but isn't. 
                    - Addition, contradiction, something else: how to justify
                    - Lumens : note as a dialogue partner; doesnt think for itself but so much better at storing as it was at that time.
                    - Writing takes more time however; sometimes it's better to read more.
            - [[Question]] Cross domain applicability outside of academia
                - For professional writers intially
                - Now more broadly; business background, coders
            - [[Question]] handwritten vs typed?
                - Different: written does have benefits. Screen is a source for distraction.
                - Risk: start thinking about the software rather than the content.
                - Ne benefit is with software.
            - [[Question]] routine: writing / note-taking balance?
                - warning: looking for a perfect system... daily routine XX projects?
                - Don't highlight things you want to take notes on later.
                - Sometimes full emersion is better; sometimes, projects have to be more ad-hoc
                - Routines for when you are stuck.
                - Being flexible more important than being rigid.
            - [[Question]] [[multiplayer Zetteling]] [[Individual and Collective Zetteling]] How will it work? How? Advice?
                - Might be more important to put it into practice: might be better to focus on the task;
                - Focus on the meaning of the book?
                - Take Zettlekasten notes as described... not alway best to write into practice.
                    - 1. Individually?
                    - 2. collectively?
                - Principles and idea of Zettlecasten is the focus of the book.
                - Large notes: granularity on the block level?
                - Collective writing allows you to do different things to that you can do on your own. Where will this go?
                    - Note sequences and density: now, within one note to lend coherence, if density then connected
                    - One information in each block; different types of links between blocks... ie. one  word = index entry. These are notes within network that are a place to jump to and from; rather than links to descriptive titles = entry points or clusters. 
                    - You need a firewall as you get familiar with your own Zettelkasten and that canâ€™t happen in a collective process; but what kind of experiences do you have when there is so much possible, when you do something collectively that is impossible when you do it on your own.
                    - These clusters are different to the index point

 09:41AM PST [[November 2nd, 2020]]
            - one problem was that some people "modded" the original template itself
            - a simple clear GIF like this should help if we repeat
            - the other thing of course is just to store the template in an out-of-the-way corner instead of actually posting it into the daily page as I did, which was clearly a mistake
            - that way people will only get at it by using the `((..` autocomplete.

- #Chat [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] #experiment [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] trial of using attribute tables to report back from small group breakouts (^^OPTIONAL^^) this is an "alpha" run of an experiment and strictly optional; 

I'll record a quick loom video during the week, to demonstrate this, for anyone who wants more detailed walkthrough
    - to participate in the experiment, when you break out into groups have one group member make a copy of this template by typing `((tem...` into HIS/HER OWN PAGE please, selecting the pulldown menu option "template: report back from small group" to get a copy of the block, then use the "apply children as text" function, to make your own copy of the sub-bullets, that you then fill out; 

only **one person should do this per group**, so please designate a "scribe" who takes the notes

(^^REQUEST^^ - please do this on your "home" page, to help us prevent clutter in the main page)
    - fill in the bullet points during your group breakout
    - Who was in this group 11.1.20 Who was in this group 11.1.20  [[Who was in this group on 11.1.20]] Who was in this group on 11.1.20 
    - if you do that, the resulting main "attribute table" constructed from all the templates will function as a memento of all the group chats in one place, and allow moderators to quickly view groups's questions and concerns

            - Hey [[Matt McKinlay]] I walked through the `((template))` with [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] and it's super easy! We even created a quick [.GIF](((ENvk5BR8f))) to show folks, can we use that as a way to generate questions and feed them into an `attr-table`? 
    - ### Notes
    - ### Ideas
    - Contradictory techniques to the indoctrinated way of traditional note-taking
    - Wide ranging research without forcing it
    - New information isn't as rooted in history as something that has been seeded and developed over time

    - Have anyone here engaged with [[Awakening from the Meaning Crisis]]? I think it's a really fascinating piece of work, full of deeply networked references - I'd love to collaborate with others on a book club, or even trying to build some interesting networked artefacts based on it. How about [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]], would love your thoughts as a psychiatrist. Here are my notes on the most recent episode I listened to - [[Notes on Awakening from the Meaning Crisis 11]] (I decided to paste it in here, since who knows, maybe I can find some connections to this book club). All the yellow highlights are my own thoughts and questions.
    - [[Rika Sukenik]] Hey Stian. I browsed your notes and am intrigued. I've started thinking more about consciousness since I started working on an open science project. I'm interested in the book club!
    - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] - hey [[@Stian HÃ¥klev]]! It's great to have you a part of the book club. I have not yet read this book but it looks fascinating. Would love to look at it more. thanks for posting your notes from it here - will take a look! 
        - at first glance, it reminds me a little of Jeffrey Kripals "the Flip" - have you read this? He has more emphasis in his book on the preternatural, but there seems a link with the "disruption leads to flow" hypothesis
- [[ed marsh]]
- [[MichaÅ‚ ParkoÅ‚a]]
    - Would love to connect with people who would be interested in discussing how to apply the ideas here to a ^^TEAM^^ context. What kinds of interactions could we enable, that were previously impossible?

        - Our group question for SÃ¶nke Ahrens:: #[[Questions for SÃ¶nke]]
            - Are [[Fleeting Notes]] necessary? What is lost by moving through a text at a slower pace, taking time to elaborate and construct Zettels while reading?
            - What are the most effective techniques for elaboration? For example, is time best spent playing "editor" to the author one is reading, tightening the arguments and restructuring the text __or__ should one read for `X` minutes and then have a writing session while trying to remember/recall rather than reference the text?

        - Re individual [[Zettelkasten]], Roam allows for more content on a single page. A single note can grow larger, encompassing more connections (supported/contradicted by), vs. the physical implementation.
        - What is the best way to identify and describe clustered connections?
    - "Goals of bookclub "
        - To figure out the most effective mapping from [[How to Take Smart Notes]] to [[Roam]]. What is the best way to take and process fleeting notes/literature notes? What are the Roam-specific implementation details for taking smart notes?
        - Most importantly: What does a Roam Zettel look like? When [[Niklas Luhmann]] developed his system, it was with a physical slip-box with the following structure:

        - ![](https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1568584395/Zettelkasten_4_svg_x0rcja.svg)
        - Does this suggest that a Zettel is a single page? Or could there be a more effective pattern based just on blocks referencing other blocks?
        - [[Andy Matuschak]] has written about [why books don't work](https://andymatuschak.org/books/) -- that they're surprisingly bad at conveying knowledge. 
        - I want to investigate the patterns in Roam (in note-taking, writing practice, spaced-repetition review) that can help me read in a way that sticks with me. What does [[deliberate practice]] look like to build this kind of skill?

#[[Questions for SÃ¶nke]]
        - How can it be Implemented in Roam? #[[Questions for SÃ¶nke]]
    - Notes from First Session and chat with [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]]
        - [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] Mentioned it spun off from a bigger academic project
        - He says there was no book he could recommend to his students about note taking
        - The traditional method in academia was start with your thesis then write out your plan, he found it frustrating
        - He was familiar with how technology influences our thinking, he was surprised by how little this topic got from his academic community, like [[Nicolas Luman]]
        - He tried himself different formats, paper, html,other apps
        - #[[Questions for SÃ¶nke]] What important changes did you notice since your book came out? or in other words, what would you update/ change if you would publish a second version in 2020?
        - Luhman sees the system as a dialog partner, that is objective against confirmation bias etc
        - His book was definitely written for academic and professional writers, but in the last 2 years through his coaching he got understanding from other people and how they tweaked his system, and he saw it works for a variety of professions, as long as you take it as a basis to develop a system for yourself
        - On the question of handwritten notes vs computer notes, he mentioned some research on that, he sees it as not either/or, whatever is relevant at this instant
        - roam removes friction from the process, as long as it doesn't take more time then the core note taking process, not too many features
            - as long as it doesn't get in the way of my thinking and writing process
        - Sonke has been using roam for 3 months, not enough for developing routine yet
        - look for a system that is perfect because you can repeat it everyday and it becomes automatic, it's more an ever evolving routine, but you can come back to the routine basics
        - being flexible is more important then being rigid
        - He mentioned he would like to develop a book that is more centered for the general audience
        - Ask yourself what do you want to do with it? maybe it's not necessary to write and add your own zettels if it's not something you need, turn it into something useful for you and your own projects
        - unless it's part of your own project to criticize and change content, an own project for your writing, then take more zettelcasting notes
        - The best way to put things into practice is not always a note
        - Sonke allows himself to write much longer notes, for reference reasons
        - you can write note sequences within one notes if they are connected
        - if not then make it granular, different types of links, between blocks and pages
        - One word hashtag is more like an index system to start with, compared to more descriptive tags of more then 1 word, whether they are standalone notes or entry points, clusters, vs the simple index collection pages
        - There needs to be a firewall between the group and your own zettelkasten, with your own notes

- #Chat [[Paul Russell]]
    - Interested in people's views on using a zettelkasten for [[STEM]] learning or research, and specifically how to implement it in Roam.
        - What are the differences to taking smart notes on e.g. the social sciences?
        - For example, how do we deal with established definitions?
            - Do we write these as individual zettels?
        - Currently I use the [[namespace]] 'knowledge/' for pages containing [[declarative knowledge]], and link to those __facts__ from my zettels (which I keep for abstract ideas or more general concepts I discover in my reading)
            - #Reply [[Tony Tong]] #@ [[Paul Russell]] Hey I would be interested in learning more about your use of namespace. What do you gain from it? [[Tony Tong]]
- [[Tony Tong]] #Chat
    - How do you guys manage you [[Chat]] thread? #[[Questions (META)]] #[[Chat guidelines]] Currently, I have a [[query]] pulling all the chat I am involved in: 
        - "{{[[query]]: {and: [[Chat]] {or: [[Tony Tong]] [[@Tony Tong]]} {not: {or: [[query]] [[~Tony Tong]] [[]]}}}}}" 
        - But it would be really nice if I know which of those are new "messages". 
        - I thought about having a "read" tag and filter out those in the query but the problem became what if people reply under that "read" block?
        - Just found "(Retired) The CSS below will take any link with "@" in front of it and turn it into a bright color. 

Note that CSSes only function if they are the active "version" - these have been turned off by being hidden into inactive "version".

Then, when you've read it, change it to "~" and it will turn green. "
            - testing
                - [[~Tony Tong]] [[@Tony Tong]]
                    - this is basically the read tag "I thought about having a "read" tag and filter out those in the query but the problem became what if people reply under that "read" block?"
                        - so same question applies here
                            - I guess a [[rule of thumb]] is to always @ someone if you want them to read and not reply in the ~ block 
    - Regarding the real-time collaboration chat "Note that one challenge is when more than one person are typing into a conversation at the same time - it can be hard to keep everything sequenced in temporal order while more than one are typing, but taking a moment to move blocks back into temporal order if they fall "out of order" -"
        - Indeed, when I tried to add my name in [[Directory]] today during the live session, it is impossible as my block get constantly moved and replaced by others who are trying to do the same. #[[Roam/improvement]]
    - I have read [[Conventions]] [[ðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹Start hereðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹]] but I couldn't find out what are [[Book Prompts]] and [[Writing Prompts]] are for. Can anyone point me to the right direction? #[[Questions (META)]] 
    - I suppose [[Fleeting Notes]] is for informal and unstructured notes on [[How to Take Smart Notes]], right? #[[Questions (META)]]
    - I found that using text and alias when [[block reference]] works better for me as it allow me to highlight on sentences of a block, providing more accurate context for my notes. 
        - e.g. 
            - "The available books fall roughly into two categories. The first teaches the formal requirements: style, structure or how to quote correctly. And then there are the psychological ones, which teach you how to get it done without mental breakdowns and before your supervisor or publisher starts refusing to move the deadline once more. What they all have in common, though, is that they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper.[ 1] But by doing this, they ignore the main part, namely note-taking, failing to understand that improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference. They seem to forget that the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development. This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and ^^interconnected notes ^^along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But most of all, you can ^^write every day in a way that brings your projects forward^^. [*](The available books fall roughly into two categories.

    - Can anyone elaborate on this as it seems counter-intuitive to me? "Don't highlight things you want to take notes on later." [[@[[andygoodman]]]]
        - hey, [[@[[Tony Tong]]]] I'm not too sure what you are referring to as counterintuitive. But If this is in reference to the boundaries between fleeting notes and literature notes, then highlighting too much using readwise is certainly something I have on my mind. 
    I highlighted everything I found interesting, initially, then recognised that a) I'd have to go back and make notes and b) I'd prefer to make notes as I go. So, I began dictating notes in readwise, being careful to not be distracted by editing those dictated notes. Now I'm putting tags into notes when dictating them. I hope that will help. I'll retry 'super-fleeting' notes: just highlighting, initially. This will increase speed and make it more likely that I have a more holistic sense of a chapter, before writing note.
    Thanks for the @! The discussing ideas with my notes is good, but discussing with others is better. :-) 
            - "#[[Reply-from]] [[andygoodman]] These 'layers' and the blurring between them have been the primary cause of uncertainty for me. I've concluded that it depends, which is not helpful since further classification is required. Since it is stated that sometimes it's fine to go straight to literature note, this doesn't cause concern.
    The guiding principle when taking fleeting notes is for them not to become a distraction from reading. As I've worked to establish where the boundary lies between 'layers' I've found it depends on the complexity of the idea in the text behind the highlight.
    When the idea is simple I dictate a note straight into readwise, which does not create distraction. When the idea is complex I doodle to make sense of the idea, which I feel is essential. I use Notes app on my ipad, which I have in a window next to Kindle app.
    When dictating my understanding to create a note for highlighted text immediately using dictation, the boundary between a fleeting note and literature note is defined by whether I make corrections to the meaning of the note. Dictation is often imperfect so when trying to maintain flow, I'll allow myself to correct erroneous words but not refine the meaning. It is tempting to clarify the meaning of the dictated note, but this would be a distraction and consequently flow would be lost. 
    I suspect that the ease with which one can generate notes using readwise and dictation might cause me problems later, by creating too many notes. I am probably not being selective enough. Also worth considering is the time between making a fleeting note and converting  it to a literature note, I think."
