- Literature Notes::
    - [[Introduction]]
        - when you write you must have a skeleton in your head or on paper. You never truly have a blank page. 
            - With good note taking you can get a great start 
            - and sometimes even let the notes decide the topic
                - ex if you have lots of notes on one topic, that might mean that would make a good paper/blogpost etc 
        - "With that in mind, it is not surprising that the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people’s heads, but in the way they do their everyday work. In fact, there is no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success–at least not north of 120. Yes, a certain intellectual capacity helps to get into academia, and if you struggle severely with an IQ test, it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems, too. But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure. What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004)." 
            - #NoticingConfusion how can we resolve the fairly contradictory claims that 1) iq gets no correlation between iq and academic performance over 120, with 2) the evidence that [[IQ]] is one of the top predictor of work performance in most jobs. (source ex [[Gwern]]s https://www.gwern.net/iq) 
                - research seems like one of the areas where iq is the most useful
                - If it stops being a predictor after 120 everywhere I would expect the iq litterature overall to say so, which to my knowledge it doesn't 
        - "It is not so important who you are, but what you do. Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, to success. At first glance, this is both good and bad news. The good news is that we wouldn't be able to do much about our IQ anyway, while it seems to be within our control to have more self-discipline with a little bit of willpower. The bad news is that we do not have this kind of control over ourselves. Self-discipline or self-control is no that easy to achieve with willpower alone. Willpower is, as far as we know today, a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term (Baumester, Bratslavsky, 1998; Schmeichel, Vohs, and Boumeister, 2003; Moller, 2006). And who would want to flog oneself to work, anyway?"
            - [[Fact checking]] hasn't [[Ego Depletion]] been in trouble from the  [[Replication Crisis]]? 
            - 
        - 
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - “I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else."
        - I like the above quote, I find that useful too. 
            - I Also think [[Anders Sandberg]] said that he did something similar when researching during an [[80'000 Hours]][[Podcast]]. 
                - that he writes or researches whatever paper he's currently the most excited about 
                    - #Pro it's more fun, and can show what you're actually interested in rather than what you think you're interested in
                    - #Con it makes planning and prioritization harder because the amount of work a certain paper/project gets during a week is hard to predict
        - "Poor students do not have any of these problems. As long as they stick within the boundaries of their discipline and read only as much as they are told to (or less), no serious external system is required and writing can be done by sticking with the usual formulas of “how to write a scientific paper.” In fact, poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). Poor students lack insight into their own limitations–as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison. That means that those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities. Poor students also have no trouble finding a question to write about: they neither lack opinions nor the confidence that they have already thought them through. They also won’t have trouble finding confirming evidence in the literature as they usually lack both interest and skill to detect and think through dis-confirming facts and arguments."
            - [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]] has also had problems from the [[Replication Crisis]] I think. If i remember correctly the effect was barely noticeable when using more modern statistical methods
            - 
        - archive-type systems are bad for connections and discvoerability 
        - [[Slipbox]]
            - other word for [[Zettelkasten]]?
            - the inventor of the method was unusually productive in his writing and research, giving the credit to the method rather than skill  
        - tools are only useful if they get incorporated into a [[Habit]] 
        - [[Book/Getting Things Done]]
            - is very useful 
            - but, in my view, fails due to the fact that the habit is too demanding. 
                - I, and many others have tried it and found it great. 
                    - But I don't know anyone who continued using it for more than a year or so. 
                    - It falls apart too much if you don't follow the habit to the letter, which most can't do for that long. 
                    - someone recommended a simplified version of it. but i can't remember what it was called :( 
        - Highly productive people deflect resistance
            - by having good [[Mindset]] (and [[Mental Habits]])
            - and a good [[Workflow]]
        - "People still search for Luhmann’s “secret,” putting down his remarkable output to him being a genius or even thinking they only need his slip-box and they would be set. Sure, you need to be smart to be successful in academia and writing, but if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just can’t be compensated by a high IQ."
            - #Question (not really important, but piqued my curiosity) what happened to his slip-box? seems like a cheap test of the method to take a normal researcher and have them try to imitate his productivity using his slip-box. especially if some said they could do it if they had the slip box.
                - ofc some of it will be outdated today, but it still seems like an interesting test of the method. 
        - 1.3 the slip-box manual
            - how to (in my words)
                - setup 
                    - 2 parts
                        - biblio
                            - refs and meta notes about content of literature 
                        - main
                            - collect ideas
                            - generate ideas
                - Use
                    - when reading
                        - take out card
                            - write meta-info on the back
                                - bibliograhic
                            - write thoughts on front 
                        - put card in biblio box 
                    - When thinking later
                        - look at notes and think about relevance for writing and thinking
                        - Go to main
                            - for each new atomic idea/thought
                                - write it on new paper
                                - keep it brief
                                - write your actual toughts instead of quoting
                                    - ex saying that the didn't make a strong case for X is better than just quoting the unconvincing arguments, or ignoring it 
                                - write carefully
                                    - in complete sentences and 
                                    - with full references 
                            - if related to other card (ex follows that step, or is connected in more abstract ways )
                                - make a link to that card on this card 
                                - #NoticingConfusion based on the descripition so far im confused how this creates new connections rather than just cementing the ones you can come up with when writing the card. which is still useful but not as useful as creating new ideas automatically  
                            - 
                        - where to put the note
                            - put it after the most relevant card
                                - and give it address after that card (the next num or by adding decimals etc )
                                    - gives endless possibility of branching 
                            - if it refs several cards
                                - put it after the main one, and put ref to the other cards, or ref to this on the other card 
                    - When sorting notes
                        - add index 
                            - which lists what card you can start from 
    - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
        - "At this point, it should become clear that you don’t need to wait for a genie to appear, as each step is clearly not only within your abilities, but also straightforward and well defined: Assemble notes and bring them into order, turn these notes into a draft, review it and you are done."
            - I found this an interesting concept and chose to call this the [[Genie Backtracking Method]] to make it more snappy and memorable 
                - Imagine that a genie had prepared your task to the extent where you could effortlessly work at the peak of your abilities and finish the task. 
                - How would that genie have prepared it?
                - How can you be that genie for your future self?
                    - should you write a outline, find an answer to question X, find emails of experts to contact aso 
                - repeat this backwards until you feel like the starting step would be something clear, actionable and useful
                    - be careful in not falling into a [[Meta Trap]] of trying to define each micro step and not getting anything done
                        - the outcome should be something more general. A broad strategy that makes each step of the way straight forward and useful.
                    - I'm unsure if this would be useful as a real "method" or just a neat little mental trick to use if you're feeling stuck
        - Our brains are genuinely not able to solve problems like nuclear physics on their own
            - we need tools to make up for the weaknesses
                - especially high precision 
                - and perfect recal
            - and for many other tasks you might be able to make some progress without tools
                - but it with severely hamper you
            - calculating by hand, or with computer, comfortably solves the high precision part
                - but for recall most techniques are faulty
                    - and rely on writing things down and then trying to either
                        - use human intelligence to find it again
                            - ex write it down and then brainstorm and search for where it was
                        - have rigid systems to lock it in
                            - ie write it in a super structured system that doesn't allow much interaction between different areas etc
        - Writing paper step by step
            - Make notes 
                - fleeting notes
                    - same as [[GTD]] [[in-tray]]
                    -  just record it quickly and sort and format it later
                - literature notes
                    - own words
                    - selective 
                    - only quote if you understand it 
                    - put in ref sytem 
                - permanent notes
                    - refine notes
                        - more concise
                        - update or add refs to other notes
                            - contradict
                            - correct 
                            - support
                            - or expand 
                        - upon other cards, or concepts in your head
                        - Or generate further cards 
                    - TO think of
                        - write as if you were writing to someone else
                            - use full sentences,
                                - #Question why should you use full sentences on permanent notes? Is it to make it easier to read when you later return to it, or some other reason
                                    - because I've personally decided to write with a decent amount of shorthand aso to make my notes as concise and pleasant to write as possible. 
                                        - And I can return to old notes without much effort, unless I've really overdone the shortening. 
                                        - so is it just a safety measure because you can overestimate how much you can understand when reading it later,
                                        -  or is it more to do with making it effortful to write the notes and thereby cement them more in your mind? 
                                        - or some other reason?
                            - sources
                            - references
                            - be precise, clear and brief
                - 
            - 4 Add notes into your system
            - 5 work within your system
                - example tasks/questions 
                    - what is missing
                    - what questions arise 
                    - what other perspectives should be incorporaed 
                    - what can be refined and summarized further
                    - what parts are weak or strong?
                    - what parts interest you? 
                - Don't brainstorm,look in the system
                    -  look for clusters in the system , and see what ideas have developed 
            - 6 try to form into a coherent topic/thesis 
                - when a topic seems close to mature enough
                    - copy all relevant parts to your desktop*
                        - unsure what desktop refers to here
                    - try to form lines of reasoning and see where there are holes
            - 7 start a rough draft
                - make it based on the notes but refine even furrther
                - fill in holes
                    - return to litterature if the holes prove too large 
            - 8 refine the draft to a finnished manuscript
            - 
        - You'll likely have lots of processes like this going on in parallel at any time, 
            - especially the info gathering and maturation process
