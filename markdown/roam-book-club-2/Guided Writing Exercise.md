- # üëãüèº Hi! ~~Let's spend the next 15 minutes together, working through a guided writing exercise~~ 

I've updated things after the Live Session. Just copy the link for the template, and I've written out directions and examples below~
- ### 1) `Right-click` the bullet to `Copy block ref`

2) `Option-Drag (Mac)` or `Alt-Drag (Win)` the bullet directly into your page

3) `Copy` the link below ```javascript
((9rbaT4v_v))```

- # 1) INSTRUCTIONS w/ WRITING PROMPTS:
    - ## Question 1:: #[[Fleeting Notes]] Place these answers underneath as children blocks
        1. What resonates with you?
        2. What are the associations that come to mind?
        3. What else does that remind you of?
        4. Can you pull out an abstraction from that?
    - ## Summarize Question 1:: Place this on the block as your `#Fleeting Notes` ‚Üí next to it
        1. How would you summarize what you wrote, so you can get a thumbnail understanding in one quick glance, of the larger high resolution thoughts?
    - ## Question 2:: #[[Literature Notes]]
        1. Being informed by what you abstracted, what is the author saying?
        2. How can you write that in your own words, without summarizing, to prove to yourself that you‚Äôve understood what they are saying?
        3. Were you able to abstract what the author is saying into your own words?
    - ## Summarize Question 2:: Place this on the block as your `#Literature Notes` ‚Üí next to it
        1. How would you summarize what you wrote, so you can get a thumbnail understanding in one quick glance, of the larger high resolution thoughts?
    - ## Question 3:: #Zettels
        1. Being informed by the fleeting notes, the literature notes, and the source to the right, what is the declarative statement that you can say about what you‚Äôve synthesized?
        2. How can you word this statement in a way that gives you the most clarity in what you mean?
- # 2) EXAMPLE:
    - #Zettels ^^[[Answer to Question 3 will go here, and after it has been stated clearly--use the double brackets to enclose it into a page]]^^
        - #[[Reference Notes]] ^^((block reference the SOURCE))^^
        - #[[Literature Notes]] ^^Summarization of Question 2^^
            - Answers to Question 2 will go here and because we are not limited to the physical index-cards we can elaborate further on ^^**__what we understand the author stating__**^^
            - Which allows for deeper levels of analysis and assists in "bringing up" what we have synthesized following this (bottom-up structure)
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] ^^Summarization of Question 1^^
            - Answers to Question 1 will go here and because we are note limited to the physical index-cards we can elaborate further on ^^**__what resonates for us, outside of what the author is stating__**^^
            - Which allows for deeper levels of analysis and assists in "bringing up" what we have synthesized following this (bottom-up structure)
                - We can open-and-close this wall of text to keep the entire permanent note cleanly displayed
            - Through nesting we can elaborate much further with this step than we could if we used the analog slip box 
                - And the Summarization of these notes, as a thumbnail, can be placed at the block-level above, as shown

            - It's trying to switch from Fleeing Notes to Fleeting Notes, if we don't make it a habit of immediately catching our thoughts onto a sustainable format we will lose most of them like we lose and forget our dreams
            - Today we have no excuse to refrain from this habit as it's never been easier, on the one hand we have easy capture tools on the other hands we have tools that will transfer our highlights, references and thoughts from one platform to another without any friction, think about #Roam and #Readwise
            - We have to transit from a previous habit to a new habit, this takes time, and a commitment from ourselves to ourselves

    - #[[Zettels]] [[Getting rid of an old habit can be replaced, for the sake of reducing friction and overcoming fear, by adhering to a new habit. This process can be aided by starting somewhere or anywhere and by the help of a structure. The structure can help both on the end goal and on reducing distractions along the way.]]
        - #[[Literature Notes]] [Chapter 14. (Paragraph 6))](((4hIM0I_l_)))
            - once the process is started, it becomes much easier to continue.
            - the exercise of adhering to a new habit goes from effort to effortless.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Creating new habits include winning an inner fear. Starting from somewhere or anywhere may be the only way, and structure may help one in the process.
            - New habits are tough. Starting and breaking the blank page fear is so difficult. So, I take it one at a time, until they become natural
            - whatever it is, just do it
            - break into the inertia
            - creating is easier than destroying
            - structure may help to create new routines, both as stimuli and and a prevention away from distraction
            - [[@Beau Haan]] helped me with the habit of responding to multiple **why**s to the to the **how**s, and how to get so many other associative thoughts from small pieces of original content.
