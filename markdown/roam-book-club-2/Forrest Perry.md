- # Tips from the "Start Here" page
    - ## ^^**Some tips on how write your notes**^^
        - **Write for discoverability**
            - Keep in mind that people aren't going to natively remember to check your page.  
            - When writing, try and think 'how would others find this' 
                - Use tags, square brackets, and attributes liberally.
        - **Write in blocks**
            - Another goal of book club is to explore block level writing. 
            - The more you can atomise your blocks, to one thought per block, the more it will allow others to remix individual blocks. 
            - Whilst it's fine to write in whatever style you want, 'block writing' is a further way to supercharge interaction in Roam. 
                - Rather than write long prose based paragraphs, break up your paragraphs into multiple blocks 
                    - >>Indent 
                        - >>  early 
                            - >>  and 
                                - >> often. 
                - This will allow others to block reference any particular block that you write, rather than an entire block which might have multiple points.
                - Check out Conor's videos on Youtube for a sense of it. e.g.
