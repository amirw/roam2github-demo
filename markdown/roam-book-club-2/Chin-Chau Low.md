- [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
    - watching the recording since i could not attend the live session
    - useful insights from [[Sönke Ahrens]]
        - doesn't take notes for everything, sometime just reading quickly
        - note taking is very time and effort consuming, so depending on whether there are projects, routines might differ
        - about how the [[Roam Book Club]] operate
            - might be more important to put it into practice, not necessarily to build a critical mass of notes
        - [[Roam]] allows him to take much longer notes due to block reference
            - original note sequences of densely connected notes can be written with within the same notes
            - hashtags are like index collection pages, with links to other related notes
                - in contrast to pages with more descriptive titles would contain more contents in addition to links
    - [[Goals for Book Club]]
        - I've already read the book and starting the practice so these goals are to be viewed within that context
            1. I want to learn how others are using [[Zettelkasten]] to improve note taking, and how I could adopt some of the practices to improve mine
                - the specific information about the practice within [[Roam]] is useful 
            2. I'm intrigued by the idea of a [[book club]] on [[Roam]], how we can connect ideas and insights from different perspectives to generate greater understanding and innovations
                - testing the collaborative aspects
            3. to ingrain in myself the note taking practice
                - close reading and note taking takes time and focused attention, not easy to sustain over long period
                    - slow and laborious 
                    - concepts are understood and remembered better
            4. to start the practice of generating [[evergreen notes]] and processing them
                - distilling ideas into notes
                    - self-contained
                    - discoverable
                    - lego blocks
                - To write, to output ultimately (I'm 56 btw. h/t [[Michael Nieman]])

    - [[Introduction]]
        - Writing is part of research, learning and studying, not an activity that happens after these.
        - With proper notes, we can eliminate empty pages, and make writing easier and more fun.
        - When we do not take notes correctly, the problems are not obvious until too late in the process.
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - A good note taking system encourages flow, it does not burden the will power unnecessarily.
        - It can be trusted to remember and keep track of what's important so that you could focus on the content, the ideas, and the arguments.
        - It provides structure so that writing is broken down into small chunks that can be handled individually.
        - It is not a rigid inflexible plan that can be against the flow of research and thinking, and be demotivating.
        - 1.1 Good Solutions are Simple and Unexpected
            - Note taking can be complex. Besides collecting a complex body of content, we strive to make connections and spark new ideas.
            - Some people would tackle the complexity by organizing the notes into small parcels and sort them hierarchically. This can get complicated and also reduce the chances of finding new connections between the notes.
            - To avoid these problems and still address usability and usefulness, we combine two well-known, well proven ideas: the simple slip-box and a process of simple repeatable tasks and routines.
            - Inspired by GTD techniques and insights, but with more flexibility in the tasks and activities since learning, thinking, and writing are non-linear.
        - 1.2 The Slip-Box
            - Niklas Luhmann, staff of a German administration office in 1960s, and son of a brewer.
            - Instead of adding notes to categories, he wrote one idea on one note, numbered each note and collected them in one place.
            - He realized that the ideas are only as valuable as the contexts that they can contribute to.
            - Using the slip-box, he organised the notes to facilitate interaction, generate ideas, and structure and develop his thoughts.
            - In 30 years, he published 58 books and hundreds of articles, many of them classics.
            - The advantage comes form the slip-box combined with a simple workflow.
        - 1.3 The slip-box manual
            - This section gives a brief outline of the workflow.
            - Using two slip-boxes, one bibliographical (literature notes), the other main box for collecting and generating ideas.
            - Literature notes are reviewed for their relevance. Comments and thoughts are written on new pieces of paper that go into the main box.
            - Notes are in complete sentences with explicit literature references in the same style as final manuscripts.
            - Notes are linked through ordering and references.
            - Notes are not organised by topics but abstractly through connections with other notes.
            - Topics are developed from bottom up.
            - Index notes would reference one or two notes that could serve as entry points into a line of thought or a topic.
    - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
        - With a system of smart notes, you do not need to start with a blank page.
        - Notes and ideas are generated when you read, review, and think.
        - These organised notes will provide the ideas and rough draft for the writing.
        - 2.1 Writing a paper step by step
            1. Make fleeting notes from your thoughts
            2. Make literature notes on contents that you read. Keep it short and selective.
            3. Make permanent notes by reviewing fleeting and literature notes. The main purpose is to develop ideas in connection with existing ideas. Throw away fleeting notes but keep the literature notes.
            4. Add links to related notes, and make sure it can be reached through some index.
            5. Develop topics, questions, research from the notes to develop interesting ideas by reviewing, questioning, connecting and reading to fill the gaps.
            6. When the ideas are developed sufficiently, you can choose a topic to write about.
            7. Turn the notes into a manuscript by rewriting them into something coherent. Fix holes in the argument.
            8. Edit and proofread.
    - [[Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have]]
        - Unnecessary tools and workflow can introduce clutter, and complicate the process not simplify it
        - Strip the workflow down to the essential to focus on what's important, and to assist thinking.
            - 3.1 The Tool Box
                - something to write with and something to write on (pen and paper)
                - A reference management system
                - The slip-box
                - An editor
                - 1. Something to capture ideas whenever and wherever. Need not be stored permanently, to be processed regularly, preferably daily.
                - 2. A reference management system for collecting references. Recommends Zotero.
                - 3. The slip-box, recommended Daniel Lüdecke’s Zettelkasten. Currently using Roam Research.
                - 4. Editor for writing.

            - If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing.

            - ""#quote ^^The slip-box is the shipping container of the academic world. Instead of having different storage for different ideas, everything goes into the same slip-box and is standardised into the same format^^". Instead of focusing on the in-between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published. The biggest advantage compared to a top-down storage system organised by topics is that the slip-box becomes more and more valuable the more it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing. If you sort by topic, you are faced with the dilemma of either adding more and more notes to one topic, which makes them increasingly hard to find, or adding more and more topics and subtopics to it, which only shifts the mess to another level. The first system is designed to find things you deliberately search for, putting all the responsibility on your brain. The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. [*](((EVjA9eABJ)))"

    - [[Afterword]]
- Fleeting notes::
    - In the [[Introduction]], [[Sönke Ahrens]] starts by emphasizing the central role of writing as the medium for research, learning and studying.
        - If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=719)) #quote
    - Good note taking means we never have to start with a blank page.
        - To sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic. #quote
    - Notes should be organized by how they might be used in the future.
        - In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=787))
    - Instead of focusing on the in-between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published. ([Location 792](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=792))
    - The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=818))
    - The second typical mistake is to collect notes only related to specific projects. On first sight, it makes much more sense. You decide on what you are going to write about and then collect everything that helps you to do that. The disadvantage is that you have to start all over after each project and cut off all other promising lines of thought. ([Location 822](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=822))
    - Fleeting literature notes can make sense if you need an extra step to understand or grasp an idea, but they will not help you in the later stages of the writing process, as no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument. These kinds of notes are just reminders of a thought, which you haven’t had the time to elaborate on yet. Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. ([Location 845](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=845))
    - Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=922))
    - hermeneutic circle ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=923))
        - "Understanding the hermeneutic circle is key to critical reading. The 
hermeneutic circle refers to the idea that our understanding of a text 
as a whole is based on our understanding of each individual part, as 
well as our understanding of how each individual part refers to the 
whole text." from [The hermeneutic circle: a key to critical reading | nesslab](https://nesslabs.com/hermeneutic-circle)
