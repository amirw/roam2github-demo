â†’ #Reply [[My Name]] (Nested underneath, someone's `#Chat`)

â†’ #Question [[Their Name]] (This is for directing a question AT someone)

â†’ #Help [[My Name]] (If YOU need help)

â†’ #Announcement (this one might be important)

â†’ #@ [[Their Name]] (Used in conjunction with `#Chat` and `#Reply`?)
