- How to Take Smart Notes: #Books
    - [[Introduction]]
        - Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note.
        - We don't experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly
        - Not everything is worth taking notes, sometimes is best to just browse or read more and not take notes. But most valuable things are
        - Immerse yourself first if you can, highlight to annotate later.
        - Routine is something you can rely on on a daily basis or if you are in a slump. It doesn't have to be a strict rule. 
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]] [*](((yoUr7K5eU)))  #pt-br
        - Em nenhum momento é ensinado como criar um sistema que permita escrever e tomar notas de maneira a criar conteúdo de forma permanente.
        - Possuir um estrutura é importante e diferente de fazer planos [*](((e5t8EGtoY)))
            - Não consegui fazer uma boa distinção sobre esses termos.
        - Bons estudantes
            - Tendem a se questionar o tempo todo.
            - Constantemente elevam sua régua de exigência
            - Olham além do óbvio
            - São perfeccionistas
            - Comumente sofrem da Síndrome do Impostor
        - ** 1.1 Boas Soluções são Simples - e Inesperadas**
            - O sistema tem que ser simples e seguir alguns princípios básicos
                - Do contrário você simplesmente não vai utilizá-lo com consistência.
            - Um sistema não é feito somente de ferramentas
            - Rotinas diárias são mais importantes que qualquer sistema ou ferramenta. Nada lhe fará mais produtivo se não ser incorporado em sua rotina. Afinal é no dia-a-dia que as coisas acontecem 
        - ** The Slip-Box **
            - Fleeting Notes -> Literatura Notes -> Permanent Notes-> Zettels
                - The Zettels are your permanent notes added to your slip-box, then insights are interlinked with everything else. It has a compound effect to show you connections you never thought off and became a constant dialogue partner with everything you read and learn.
    - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]] [*](((UH2V7XS50)))
        - An effective zettelkasten system changes the task of writing
            - Writing notes is not hard, is easy. Reading with focus and thinking is hard. Just have a keyboard or a pen and paper around. The notes just follow the main work and if it's done right, it helps it.
        - An effective zettelkasten transforms each stage of the writing process
            - ((hcmEC2IPn))
            - ((nQIkcuZZt))
        - To write is to think. Even better, to write forces you to think clearer. #quote [[James Clear]] "Most people think they lack motivation when they really lack clarity." 
        - Having clear thinking registered is progress, even if a small one. The best motivator of all is progress. 
        - Reading and thinking are the only hard part in the process. Given any intelectual endeavour you are supposed to do that anyway. By keeping literature notes you are able to create a permanent outcome accompanying your main work and have a repository of ideas stored.
        - **2.1 Writing a paper step by step**
            - Make Fleeting Notes
                - Basically the same idea of the mind dump: Don't keep anything on your head, write it down.
            - Make Literature Notes
                -  Keep a record of what you learn and don't want to forget. 
                - Keep it short, extremely selective and write in your own words.
                - Don't copy quotes to skip the work to really understand them.
            - Make Permanent Notes
                - Review your fleeting notes and literature notes regularly is key. You have to make them into your permanent notes, keep them with references. The key is not to collect but generate ideas, as long as is aligned with your interests anyway. 
                - **The most important task is to do this regularly, ideally each day. **
            - Add permanent notes to your slip-box. I don't get yet at this point the concept of Zettel
        - Don't think you can start from scratch. Actually, you are starting with a whole bunch of ideas and connections of everything you've read and watch.
            - #quote [[James Clear]]"What looks like talent is often careful preparation.
            - #quote [[James Clear]]What looks like skill is often persistent revision."
        - Review constantly your Fleeting and Permanent Notes: They are only valuable when related to your interests and how they are going to help you generate and develop ideas.  
    - [[Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have]]
        - Handling of the tool if more important than tool itself
            - Roam, Notion and Pen and Paper won't make a Zettel by itself
    - [[Chapter 4. A Few Things to Keep in Mind]]
        - A good system doesn't add friction to your workflow but diminishes it and remove distractions. A tool is always ready to be used 
        - Put time into organising how to use your tools and slip box.
    - [[The Four Underlying Principles]]
        - [[Chapter 5. Writing is the Only Thing That Matters]]
            - Writing is what matters
            - Writing **should be** the medium of learning
                - Look at studying as a form of research. You cannot anticipate insight before studying the literature. 
                - Look at research as a form of writing. Abandon the notion that writing is a separate process only to be used when in need to deliver content.
                - Treat writing as not the medium but the end itself. Whatever the output format you later have to present.
            - If you focus on writing you do everything else differently, you'll have a clear purpose when watching a video, lecture or reading a book: Explore the concepts and distill the knowledge in the most efficient manner until the open questions arise. And that's the only thing worth writing about.
            - #Zettels [[To write is not only to think but clarified thinking.]]
                - #[[Literature Notes]] If you want to really understand something you have to write it in your own words, that's essentially what happens when you try to teach someone. You are forced to process and formulate the concepts, suppress the noise, clear the garbage, and structure the delivery.[*](((9LdD6VzxA)))
                -  #[[Fleeting Notes]] Your first write it down because your memory is unreliable and the capacity of your working memory is limited. The process describe in the book injects a Feynman Technique in your learning workflow.
        - [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
            - When trying to save something you've learned, think: In which context would I want to stumble upon this note? [*](((qjApgS0oM)))
            - #[[Literature Notes]] Forget the classic labeling and categorization of things you read and learn. In this system you pretty much rely on your brain to search for something you already forgot and trust you've labeled it perfectly to be found in this exact context. The more we read and learn the more topics, tags, and subtopics we'll create making it even harder to use it effectively
            - Read, listen and watch with one bottom-line: insight that can be published. [*](((EVjA9eABJ)))
            - If you never sit down, review your notes and focus what can be saved and reused it's better not bother writing anything.
            - Project Based Notes
                - You either focus only on the project at hand 
                    - You lose any insight generated during the project.
                - You open a new project every time you stumble upon a good idea
                    - You'll never finish any project or create a critical mass of ideas.
                - #quote without a permanent reservoir of ideas, you will not be able to develop any major ideas over a longer period of time because you are restricting yourself either to the length of a single project or the capacity of your memory.
            - "What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. More notes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring related ones together in a playful way. But it should be just the opposite: The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones–and the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort."
            - #quote The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.
        - [[Chapter 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch]]
            - #quote Every Intelectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception. #[[Hermeneutic Circle]]
            - The concept that you have first decide a topic of your interest and then do a research about it is banal or misleading:
                - It's banal if implies you only should only put words on paper after carefully thinking about it. Remember: "#Zettels [[To write is not only to think but clarified thinking.]]"So you should always write, only to question the most efficient way to do it
                - It's misleading in the way you can make a sound plan on what to write before reading and thinking about it which, as we saw it, involves writing since the beginning.
                - We start with a note-taking as a system and with insight as a goal. Read, develop ideas on paper, clean, review and build up an increasingly repository of externalised thoughts.
                - The path lead by your curiosity, interests and questions arised in this process creates a very handy material full of insights. It makes concrete the notion that no one starts from scratch.
                - #quote But those who have already developed their thinking through writing can keep the focus on what is interesting for them at the moment and accumulate substantial material just by doing what they most feel like doing.
                - "But those who have already developed their thinking through writing can keep the focus on what is interesting for them at the moment and accumulate substantial material just by doing what they most feel like doing. The material will cluster around the questions they returned to most often, so they don’t risk too far of a departure from their interest. If your first chosen topic turns out to be not as interesting, you will just move on and your notes will cluster around something else. Maybe you will even note down the reasons why the first question is not interesting and turn that into an insight valuable enough to make public. When it finally comes to the decision on what to write about, you will already have made the decision–because you made it on every single step along the way, again and again every day, improving it gradually. Instead of spending your time worrying about finding the right topic, you will spend your time actually working on your already existing interests and doing what is necessary to make informed decisions–reading, thinking and writing. By doing the work, you can trust that interesting questions will emerge. You might not know where you will end up (and you don’t need to), but you can’t force insight into a preconceived direction anyway. You minimise both the risk of losing interest in a topic you have once chosen ill-informed and the risk of having to start all over again."
        - [[Chapter 8. Let the Work Carry You Forward]]
            - To have a pen and paper or a keyboard with an annotation app open while we read forces us to process and manipulate the content in our working memory. The acclaimed Feynman Method is just a development further than this: to annotate and explain it as clear as possible in the simplest manner as if you are going to teach someone else. This self is usually yourself in the future. 
            - Roam Research makes it the slip-box concept to shine: To create an interconnected web of ideas and references which grows exponentially. When searching for an idea or reference you'll find notes and references you didn't search for. That's the game changing part.

        - [[Chapter 9. Separate the Interlocking Tasks]]#[[Literature Notes]] 
            - {{[[POMO]]: 25}}
            - Multitaskers think of themselves as productive because of multitasking[*](((r_KY4vkpO)))
                - And think they are good at it.
                - It's hard to improve something you are bad when you think otherwise.
            - For most things we get better by doing it multiple times.
                - That's not true for multitasking.
                - Every switch of attention drains your ability to switch and delays the moment we manage to get focused again
                - The reason why this happens is that we tend to confuse familiarity with skill and lack of external measure to provide feedback.
            - How is this related to writing?
                - The writing as a mean and an end, as described in this book, involves multiple tasks requiring different kinds of attention.
                    - reading, understanding, reflecting, making connections, distinguishing terms, structuring, organizing, editing and rewriting
                - It's important to give each task an undivided atention and most importantly the right kind of atention.
            - What is the difference of "focused-attention" and "sustained attention"?[*](((d0FZTHICy)))
                - The distinction in the book is not much clear. But the second one is the more canonical state where you are concentrated on the task at hand. It's more or less the common sense of focus.
                - "focused-attention" is the flow-like state-of-mind. Where you're "laser-focused" and lose the sense of time immersed. 
            - What is being a critic to your text?
                - When you proofread you text with a clear separation from yourself as writer. This way you can see what it written not your thoughts on the process. It doesn't matter what you mean, just what you wrote it.[*](((-S1cj4FRf)))
            - How is the reverse process, separate the writer from the critic?
                - It's crucial to write it down your thoughts on paper and let the open the space for clear thinking without worrying about the form, instead actively blocking any early concerns about the form. 
                - To write the perfect sentence first hand is to not write anything at the end. 
                - By doing this and thinking you are a helpless perfectionist is just to fool yourself. Not know how to separate the different parts of the process and being stuck on the very first part of the process is simply amateuristm.
                - #quote "The first principle is not to fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool." [[Richard Feynman]]
            -    "#quote ^^The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.” (Dean, 2013, 152)^^"
            - Planning for insight doesn't work. When we stop making plans is when we start making progress. Since insight creation, like a paper, is dependent on cognition and thinking it doesn't mean you can plan for it just using your cognition and thinking. Simply there is no  universal rule or structure which can deliver content and insight
            - The paramedics experiment shows that to follow rules doesn't mean you make the right decisions in a given situation. If you are a beginner you have no choice but to follow the rules you've learned, that's also the mistake of teachers which formed these students: they judge if you are a rule follower.[*](((kBKacUmpA)))
            - Experts on the other hand, moved knowledge and rules from System 2 to System 1. The rules matter until they don't. [*](((_OQvZf-JV)))

            - **9.5 Get Closure**
                - Attention is a limited resource. Working memory too
                - To free our working memory buffer we have to write things down, specially minor and unimportant tasks which, if not dealt, can occupy important resources. 
                    - Zeigarnik Effect: Open tasks tend to occupy out short-term memory until they are done. 
                    - That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance.
                    - To our brains, to finish a task or to write it down for later has the same effect.
                - The only way to solve our working memory capacity is by chunking.
                - Chunking is only effectively made by understanding, reflecting, questioning and making connections.[*](((NoSn2MlYm)))
                - Use the Zeigarnik Effect to your advantage: Keep unanswered questions in your mind and let you brain ruminate on them and put System 1 thinking to work.
                    - Don't think about errands when looking for insight but plan to find them while doing errands.
            - **9.6 Reduce the Number of Decisions**
                - Optimize willpower
        - [[Chapter 10: Read for Understanding]]
            - **10.1 Read with a Pen in Hand**
                - Paper <- Good Draft <- Zettels / Literature Notes <- Notes
                - When you read for understanding and transform what you read into your own thinking gradually this content becomes your own.
                - You read, process and annotate. 
                - You distill your notes and make connections with other things you read and thought.
                - This is further shaped by the previous books, ideas and mental models in your head.
                - These are constantly interacting and reshaping themselves while iterating in this process. 
                - If you want to insert what you read into your bucket of knowledge and to contribute to your mental model you have to read for understanding. Take Fleeting Notes from what you read, process your notes into Literature Notes along with the bibliographic details and turn those into your slip-box of ideas.
                - The research which shows the superiority of taking notes by hand is clearly explainable by this procedure. 
                    - You cannot copy and paste by hand. You can't write as fast and erase what you've written uncorrectly. So you are force to focus, understand and distill the information in a gist to write it down.
                    - It forces you to optimize your note-taking and apply the process just described immediately in every note.
            - **10.2 Keep and Open Mind**
                - Always beware of the major force of **Confirmation Bias**. Specially when taking your Permanent Notes
                - The very moment we decide in an Hypotheses, our brains immediatelly starts searching for confirming thoughts.
                - We don't do it on purpose. We just see what we are already primed to see.
                - We read things that make sense to us and keep people around who think like us.
                - Follow Darwin to keep Confirmation Bias in check: Investigate deeply arguments that are critical to confront your mental models.
                -  When we make a decision on what to write beforehand, do research to confirm our preconceived ideas on the already decided topic, artificially try to seek and dismiss disconfirming arguments.
                - The slip-box only cares about ideas and connections and if anything new encountered adds to the discussion.
                - Contradictory ideas add and enrich the process to further investigation.
                - Make the shift from Pros and Cons to Relevant and Irrelevant. 
                - From thesis and confirming arguments to ideas and connections.
                - From this perspective to actively seek out disconfirming facts and arguments, like Darwin, makes the slip-box richer. Contradictions hints the interest and excitement of the project. 
            - **Get the Gist**
                - Practice to get the gist of a paragraph or even a chapter quickly. Train to spot patterns and improve your reading and understanding faster.
                - To be able to do that we have to be selective of what we read and use our own judgment when doing that. #quote "Imaturity is the inability to use one's own understanding without another's guidance."
                - When rewriting into our own words, we have to shift towards our frames, patterns, mental models and assumptions.
                - It makes sense to investigate what is not included in the text, when is not applicable. What is **not** meant.
                - This is a deliberate practice exercise to escape the immaturity described by Kant and develop critical thinking. 
                - Without reframing questions, testing hypotheses, clarifying assumptions we wouldn't be able to make our knowledge useful. This is more important than extensive knowledge.
                - Knowledge not shared has the same value as the paper not published. 
            - **Learn to Read**
                - To learn how to read is to discard, once and for all, the methods which not only don't work but are a complete waste of time
                    - Rereading
                        -  Every time we read again or review an item the familiarity effect kicks in.
                        - The familiarity gives us an illusion of learning, tricks our brain which can't distinguish familiarity from understanding.
                    - Underlining
                        - To underline a sentence and a paragraph is to trick your brain into thinking you process it and understood that sentence, since you are underlining.
                    - To antidote is to have a system in place which forces you to apply deliberate practice systematically.
                        - To read, annotate, summarize, and distill into your own words everything you read.
                - When you try to write something concise and complete, without needing the original context, you can clearly see your lack of understanding, the holes in your argument and are forced to clarify your thinking without some bullshit you could easily get away when just thinking for yourself while your read or in an oral presentation.
                - It seems like a lot of work to apply this method for everything you read, but if you want to understand something there is no other way, or you are just fooling yourself.
            - **Learn by Reading**
                - To try to recall a piece of information you've learned, even when you didn't even learn in the first place, activates your working memory to try and find connections and almost forgotten ideas.
                - When confronted with the concept latter, you have better chances to remember it and retain the information.
                - Compare it with exercise: Reading is to see your instructor do the move. To annotate and elaborate in your own words is to do it yourself.
                - The slip-box keeps the information objectively unaltered,  contextually retrievable, and was fed by your own words so consists of your long-term memory - i.e. Your Second Brain in Tiago Forte's analogy - it frees your brain to do what it does best: Be creative and make connections.
        - [[Chapter 11. Take Smart Notes]]
            - Not only you should not underline, reread and quote a text out of context, to take smart notes it means you should be able to read a text with questions already in mind. 
            - You should be capable to identify the frame of the author, its assumptions and confront them with the ideas from other sources and yourself.
            - Don't immerse yourself in the text and accept its questions and answers as a given.
            - What sets aside the slip-box of permanent notes is the compound effect it has when it reaches a critical mass. The connections you would've not made, the conversation partner who will enrich or contrast your present ideas with previous ones from months or even years ago.
            - Once again is hammered that writing down is a form of self-testing, a translation from a rapid-fire of ideas and thoughts from your brain to a fixed media. It's not a copy but a translation and augmented version of it, because it is your thoughts clarified and separated from your self. This distance allows scrutinization, by yourself and others.
            - Only with this external scaffolding our recorded ideas can function as mental models and fuel further thinking.
            - Writing down allows us to forget - forgetting is the most important aspect of learning. 
                - If we were like Solomon Shereshevski, we would be overwhelmed by irrelevant facts and minor details and connections every time we need to distill and get the gist of anything. We would not get the insights or the grand meaning of anything.
            - In this sense we should not focus on storing everything but create useful triggers and as many connections as possible to be able to recall important concepts when expose by meaningful in the situation. 
            - The challenge of writing and learning is understanding. We've already learned what we've already understood. When we read something, the meaning is not always obvious, we have to explore and writing and elaborating on it is the means to do that. Elaborating is to connect with other conclusions and pieces of information we already have.
            - The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information to be able to write about it. The second step is to connect this with others contexts as well.
            - If you do this process of writing it down, elaborating and focus every learning endeavour on understanding, you cannot help but to learn and over time make more and more meaningful connections with everything you study.
            - It's of utmost importance to always go beyond what you are currently reading and confront with everything else. What are the assumptions, in what contexts it doesn't no apply or the mental model implied fails. To what it connects, which questions elicit.

        - Intro
            - Plan impose a structure. You have to push yourself constantly and depletes WillPower
            - Planning is often at odds with research, insight and learning.
            - Messing around is not the alternative to planning. Insights are not planned by default.
            - #quote Having a clear structure to work is completely different than making plans about something
                - The difference is not much clear for me at this point 
            - A good structure is reliable. Break down the amorphous task of writing an article into clear chunks.
            - #quote  Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas.
                - I'm not an expert or researcher in anything but that's the reason I continuously study and try to learn new things.
        - Good Solutions are Simple and Unexpected
            - #quote Most people try to reduce complexity by separating what they have into smaller stacks, piles or separate folders. They sort their notes by topics and sub-topics, which makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes very complicated. Plus, it reduces the likelihood of building and finding surprising connections between the notes themselves, which means a trade-off between its usability and usefulness.
            - A tool, workflow or technique will not be of much use if you don't do the work. Nothing will do the work for you. This seems obvious but time and again I forget this principle.
            - #quote  Just an Awesome quote: “My project: theory of society. Duration: 30 years. Costs: zero” (Luhmann, 1997, 11). In sociology, a “theory of society” is the mother of all projects. 
            - #quote  “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f.)[4]
            - #quote Writing is the antidote to confusion (James Clear)
            - Hard work can be fun if it's aligned with our goals and values. 
            - The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. To do that we must have routines to decrease friction and a system flexible enough to adapt to changes.

        - Uma ideia somente possui valor se compartilhada e nesse contexto particular escrita. Estudar é fazer pesquisa por si só, angariar ideias que serão conectadas com outras ideias e argumentos no intuito de produzir uma linha de pensamento original. Uma ideia mantida para si mesmo tem o mesmo valor como se nunca tivesse existido. 
        - Considere a escrita como o fim e o meio.
        - Ao ler um livro, assistir um seminário ou aula se tivermos sempre em mente o destilar daquelas ideias na forma escrita teremos foco e um objetivo claro. Injetamos a prática deliberada no processo.
        - Não é possível explicar com suas palavras algo que você não entende. Ao forçarmos escrever e elucidar o que lemos nos dá clareza. E isso torna muito mais provável que iremos lembrar do que lemos.
        - Escrever e elaborar o significado do que lemos em nossas próprias palavras nos força e ir além do que lemos e naturalmente vamos buscar conexões e criar algo novo.
    - "[[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]"
        - Ao anotar qualquer coisa tenha em mente: Em qual situação quererei resgatar essa nota?
    - "A good workflow can easily turn into a virtuous circle, where the positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, which helps us to get better at what we are doing, which in return makes it more likely for us to enjoy the work, and so on. But if we feel constantly stuck in our work, we will become demotivated and much more likely to procrastinate, leaving us with fewer positive or even bad experiences like missed deadlines. We might end up in a vicious circle of failure (cf. Fishbach, Eyal and Finkelstein, 2010)."
        - I've only experienced this while coding for fun, in interesting Kaggle Competitions with no other expectations than just learn a lot and maybe get a medal but with no obligations whatsoever. My main limitation is letting external pressure, even light ones from work, derail my flow and motivation. I am extremely sensitive to pressure, more often than not coming from myself.
- Literature Notes::
- [Live Session 4](((NPIQadYhw)))
    - "Reflect on the book.  What are you impressions? "
        - I didn't finished yet, still in the early literature notes. I am still in the skeptical fase where it seems too good to be true. But from the few literature notes that I've made and more from seeing the great notes from the collective, I am amazed to see some similar insights while reading some passages.
    - [Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way?](((I1HxFz57Q)))
        - Absolutely. The challenge is to make it a habit to synthesize and condense what you've read. I imagine what would be like if I did that for the past couple of years. We overestimate what we can achieve in a month and underestimate what we can do it in a year.
    - [Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? ](((WUmnRACGi)))
        - The timeline was great and I already see myself changing the way I consume knowledge and learn, forced by the collective effort and deadline created. I am not used to taking notes, not even dumb ones. It's a new skill, a new practice, and a hard habit to solidify. Time is the bottleneck as always. I've just didn't put in enough hours. The bottleneck is always time and there is no shortcut to that as mention by [[Andy Henson]]

- [[Live Session 5]]
    - "Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month. "
        - I am still only on chapter 8, lots of bad habits (mostly rereading) but the book it's already a game-changer for me. I have a long way to go, mostly create a more or less consistent habit of writing and review. The main insight for me was to do everything as if writing is the only thing that matters and hopefully ideas and content will follow once you've built a critical mass. 
    - Great ideas read, talked, or watched are just lost given our trust in our poor brains. If I can keep at least 1% of the info I consume and turn it into knowledge it would change everything for me. It's encouraging and powerfully motivating to remember and connect things. Suddenly you make connections and progress on your learning journey. Progress is the most powerful motivator.
    - "Reflect on your Zettel process"
        - I don't have one yet but inspired and beginning to build one motivated by this Book Club. I've never published any content because I never think I have something original or worthwhile to say. Now at least I'll try to have valuable things to say for myself first.

            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] You are what you do consistently 
                - What resonates to me is how everything, good or bad, boils down as habits and routines.
                - It's hammered in every productivity system that we have to write things down and free our heads. For some reason, we don't apply this to the things we read and dedicated our precious time. 
                - The main leap is to force this habit of smart notes until you stop feeling the friction and eventually feels the urge.
                - The analogy to working out is to keep going until you stop feeling miserable and sore all the time to enjoy the resistance and urge for the sweat then you don't need to force anymore.
                - From working out and programming consistently I already have clear personal evidence that we underestimate what we can do in a year and overestimate what we can do in a week. But the only thing that matters is the day and what we do with it.

I would think it's harder to be concise and extract the gist of it. Writing forces me to be clear while talking makes me ramble. What are your experience so far compared to writing?

                - [[Ronaldo Batista]] Today books are just a tiny part of how we acquire knowledge, and papers are more of a specialized technical reading. How can this process be adapted to Videos and Podcasts. It seems impossible to keep some flow of the process and still take notes. How do you do it?
