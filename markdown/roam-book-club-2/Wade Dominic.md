    - "#Reply-from [[Brandon Toner]] I agree! [[assertions]] are a maturity step in my notes. Almost everything starts as an idea, or a question. As those accumulate I form [[opinions]]. And eventually, those opinions strengthen. [[@[[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]]]] #[[My Zettelkasten Workflow]]

I use `#[[Zettel Questions]]` to address this. Feeling better about this very thing this week. And had a great day in the [[zettelkasten]] in my personal database. I'll be reflecting further on that in here. 

Here is my working array of note tags. 

[[reference notes]] — the bibliographic material and direct highlights

[[seedlings]] — bits of original inspiration, loose in format and tone-of-voice. More informal. 

[[fleeting notes]] — [[assertions]] start here. These are statements and claims. But not well thought out, yet.

[[literature notes]] — these are summaries of the author's main points. In my own words.

[[evergreen notes]] or [[permanent notes]] — these are the accumulation of [[fleeting notes]], [[seedlings]], and [[literature notes]] into a stronger idea [[synthesis]]. Densely linked and referenced, ideally. This is peak maturity of an [[atomic idea]].

[[zettel questions]] — these are questions I think of. Captured curiosities. Anything I'm wondering about. This may get noisy and I may need a tier for refined questions. Not yet, though.

[[project ideas]] — writing & creative projects — where I put the [[zettelkasten]] to work.

[[queries]] — this is where I find stray notes of these categories from around my database to gather the originals back here. Most of these notes form in some other [[context]].
"
    - "#Chat[[Mike Kramer]][[Ryan Holiday]] and [[Robert Greene]] do nothing more than [[tag]] their notes (i.e., categorize them), without links, in their analog commonplace book or [[Zettelkasten]]"
    - "[[Joel Chan]]"
        - Woah, really fun discussion!
        - I'm sympathetic to [[Matt Brockwell]]'s discomfort with the connotations of the term "permanent". I prefer the idea of **persistence**. In part because in my own work, ideas are never finished. Never! Otherwise, it's not research! So, I resonate with the idea of a "[persistently useful hypothesis](((YXlo1LggT)))"
        - Personally, in practice, when I thought about permanent notes, I felt reluctant to change them over time, whereas I am not reluctant to change and modify and edit my "zettels".
        - I also think the permanent notes term might be related to the idea of having a permanent, fixed, ID that can be used to link to other ideas. Maybe a necessary feature for the analog manifestation of a zettelkasten.
        - I also think the recurring themes here about the relationship to sources being part of the core distinction between literature notes (one-to-one with a source, as [[Wade Dominic]] concisely [notes](((vn0fms9Kw)))) and "permanent notes" (akin to synoptic reading, a generalizable claim that may be supported/refuted by multiple literature notes/sources).
        - I've been developing my own model with slightly different terms:
            - Literature notes are "micropubs", which are highly contextualized, past tense, author-bound and time-bound **observations** from sources (author A did X under conditions Y and observed Z; with block references to snippets that flesh out A/X/Y/Z)
            - "Permanent notes" are higher-level "evergreen/zettel" **claims/hypotheses** (e.g., evergreen notes). 
            - I find this distinction to be powerful way to achieve a disciplined imagination for [[synthesis]], to balance the tension between theory and data, and between abstraction/compression and context.
                - Relevant quotes from [[gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] (one of my favorite books right now on creative [[synthesis]])
                    - #quotes
                        - The construction of the theory and the marshaling of the evidence entailed somewhat different activities on Darwin's part.
                        - Theory construction is a matter of rumination and schematization; it is primarily an internal effort, involving play with ideas---information and generalizations---already incorporated in existing schemes of thought; its end product is the alteration of those schemes.
                        - The marshaling of evidence and the construction of general laws from particular facts is largely a matter of observation and data collection, the noting of similarities among events, and the drawing of general conclusions. But this marshaling of evidence is not simply "induction" if that term means a theoretically neutral activity or an activity preceding the construction of a theory. The whole point is that information can __only__ be incorporated in existing schemes of thought. When we notice the similarity between events or processes that seem superficially different, we are guided by a point of view that makes some characteristics important, certain comparisons possible and meaningful. This is what Hanson meant when he wrote, "Observation is a theory-laden undertaking."
                        - The two kinds of task, theoretical and evidential, entail different activities, and in the long run they may yield distinguishable products for our consideration. But __in vivo__, in the life of the thinking person, they are thoroughly intertwined. The most speculative "castle in the air" is triggered by a simple observation or a friend's remark about his dog. Hard work amassing the facts on a special point is guided by a long theoretical argument with which it may have only a tenuous logical relationship: the theory does not absolutely depend on the facts, nor could the facts ever guarantee the theory. The relation of theory and evidence is not simply logical but psychological.

            - It's possible that my model is specific to the kind of synthesis I do for my academic research, and how zettelkasten fits into that.
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] I love that you emphasized the personalization of how you've implemented [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam]]

        - The fleeting note is a bit more nebulous for me. For me, fleeting notes are the "[chaos stream](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/roamfm/joel-chan-knowledge-0CcxF23g1OS/)" or "magic junkyard". They're like the sparks and hunches that could coalesce into a **literature note **(a cogent distillation of a contextualized claim from a source) or a **zettel/persistent/evergreen note** (a cogent distillation of a generalizable idea that I might use as a building block for synthesis)

    - "#Chat [[Gamified Randomization of Fleeting Notes]]" from [[Shana Pote]]
        - Per request, here are the various techniques I use to randomize my fleeting notes to interact with them, process them, clean them up, and percolate serendipitous insights:
            - [oschmid/roam-plugins](https://github.com/oschmid/roam-plugins/blob/master/random-page-plugin.js) - pulls a random page from All Pages
                - RoamHacker seems to be working on a more elegant version of this functionality, per a Nov 1 thread in Roam Slack
            - Charlie Mead's Random Block remixer
                - Currently only grabs first-level children, but including nested blocks is on his list of improvements, per a Roam slack comment
                - Charlie first introduced this in Roam Book Club v1. Here's a video demo: https://www.loom.com/share/8ddc1f9a0a4a44d0806d03b206b93d49
                - Here's the Roam Book Club v1 page for [RBC/Block Remixer](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/roam-book-club/page/gl7T8N7D-)
            - [David Vargas script](https://roam.davidvargas.me/extensions/query-tools/) to to enable query to return "n" randomly chosen results for any desired "n", then:
                - Include in morning TextExpander script to query a page of choice, or combination of values, then use David Vargas "n" script to pare query down to managable chunk. Useful for interacting with the last book I read, or a series of articles, or Readwise highlights, etc.
                - [Roam Toolkit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-toolkit/ebckolanhdjilblnkcgcgifaikppnhba?hl=en-US) browser extension's randomization functions; drops links to pages into the current page. Then I use David Vargas "n" script to see what pops up from that page.
                    - ctl + shft + / = random page in main window
                    - ctl + shft + windows key + / = random page in left sidebar

            - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] __although this site is a wealth of information, there is room outside of what they deem "the way" for exploration, and especially in regards to__ [[Roam]]__'s technological advances to link at a block-level.__
            - __I actually much prefer__ [[Daniel Lüdecke]]__'s take on __[[Zettelkasten]]__ in a digital form__
            - "Luhmann himself stated that his productivity stems from working in a partnership with his Zettelkasten. This strikes a chord with people investigating the Zettelkasten Method.(2)"
                - NB they do NOT say that the Zettelkasten was what made Luhmann so accomplished, merely that Luhmann modestly affirmed that.
                    - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] __"One of the most basic presuppositions of communication is that the partners can mutually surprise each other."__ [Source](https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes)
                    - cf [[How to Take Smart Notes]] which does seem to say that if I do a slip-box I will become Luhmann-like
            - "The Zettelkasten Method streamlines our workflow by giving clear guidelines on what to do. This, in turn, decreases friction. It is quite common to enter a stage of flow which further increases productivity. "
                - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] __Just because the friction is decreased it doesn't mean the difficulty of effort over time is any less strenuous __

                - I question this. I think [[Robert A. Bjork]] concept of desirable difficulty has some merit, so decreasing friction is not necessarily a desideratum
            - The Principle of Atomicity
                - "each Zettel only contains one" thought 'and one only"
                    - both [[Barbara Oakley]] and [[Steven Johnson]] emphasize that what is complex at one level of analysis is atomic at another level. See the concept of "[[chunking]]" in [[[[Barbara Oakley]] A Mind for Numbers]]
            - the "body" of the Zettel is the thought
                - we of the [[Roam Book Club]], and I would claim [[Andy Matuschak]]have been creating pithy titles which capture the thought.
                    - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] __"The technical requirements of slip boxes involve wooden boxes, which have drawers that can be pulled open, and pieces of paper in octavo format (about half of a letter-size sheet). We should only write on one side of these papers so that in searching through them, we do not have to take out a paper in order to read it."__ [Source](https://luhmann.surge.sh/communicating-with-slip-boxes)
                    - __I'm not against short titles that summarize succinctly, but also remember that this process is a derivative of an analog form__
                - if we choose to have a body, it is elaboration
                - we have an explicit "related claims" section
                    - they argue that if you just list related claims without explanation "you will not create knowledg." 
                        - I think that statement might be too strong, but I agree with its spirit
            - Structure notes
                - [[@Beau Haan]]said during the zoom session that the Folgezettel obviates the need for Structure Notes
                    - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] this split that happened between [[Daniel Lüdecke]] and the Zettelkasten.de guys was most apparent in the forum threads from 2015, but the way the word "Structure Notes" are used is different, since [[Sönke Ahrens]]'s speaks of the need to be able to create entry-points into the [[Zettelkasten]], compared to:
                        - __"With the Folgezettel technique you __have__ to give each note a place. With Structure Notes you __need__ to give each note a place."__ [Source](https://forum.zettelkasten.de/discussion/comment/8302#Comment_8302)
                    - #Chat [[in-response-to]] [[@Mike Kramer]] __as for what exactly a __[[Folgezettel]]__ is, this __[article](https://medium.com/@ethomasv/the-folgezettel-conundrum-20b14dc986ec)__ explains it pretty well, without the beef between the two camps...__
                        - __And what I'm getting at, and probably the most important aspect of all of this, is how __[[Roam]]__'s capacity to handle data differently from other note-taking tools is what might be the difference that can effectively transmute the analog signal into a digital domain--without losing that analog hum __[Analog vs. Digitial](https://urm.academy/making-digital-sound-analog-the-best-of-both-worlds/)

        - Having a galaxy brain moment here 🤯
            - I like this note from [[Brandon Toner]]. 
                - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] [[permanent notes]] are [[assertions]].[*](((3oGNZLyip)))"
                    - #Reply [[Brandon Toner]] Love it! #HIGH-FIVE
            - I was trying to think through this as seen below. But the above is really an AHA moment for me.
                - "What I have in mind is unlike the old Zettelkasten where it was impossible to get a whole overview of it. In this medium I think you can get pretty close. One could trace through their permanent notes marking them as reviewed with a datestamp. Then you could pick this up at any point in time in the future and filter out the ones you have already reviewed, their review stage or review date ranges. Although I am yet to thoroughly think this through. Some possible markers could be something like `checked`, `open to more links`, `archive` or `up for deletion`. This tracing process would provide the opportunity to review the quality of your zettels and their connections in a systematic way. Sometimes you may not know how a zettel connects to another and only upon seeing it after reviewing a bunch of others you have made would that connection become clear. I would treat the `archive` tag with care or `up for deletion` tag with extreme caution. But having these here would allow you to ensure the quality of your zettelkasten over time with the ability to filter them out. "
            - We **Assert** a note into our [[zettelkasten]] and we **Retract** when it is no longer valid.
            - Watch this video until **7:06**. Which shows some basics of an immutable database built on facts, [[assertions]], [[retractions]] and time.
                - https://youtu.be/7lm3K8zVOdY?t=234
            - Funnily enough I have thought about [[retractions]] when it comes to statements before. But somehow it never clicked in this context until [[Brandon Toner]]'s note.
                - https://twitter.com/groundedSAGE/status/1145222445399465984?s=20
            - Let's also take a moment to think about the metadata that goes into [[datomic]] style [[datalog]] [[database]].
                - The core is EAVT along with it's operation
                    - E - entity
                    - A - attribute
                    - V - value
                    - T - transaction 
                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FnQq6uOx2xK.png?alt=media&token=56b7b514-fd90-4e84-8db5-34189c181414)
                - Now to think about this in the context of a [[zettelkasten]]
                    - E = **Author**
                        - The individual that has come up with this. Or in the case of a cross-referencing of different roam dbs. The db that this comes from.
                    - A = **Note type**
                        - [[permanent note]], [[literature note]], [[fleeting note]], etc
                    - V = **Note**
                        - The statement being made
                    - T = **Time**
                        - The time that the statement was made
                    - Op = **Assertion** or **Retraction**
            - Now how to we bring this to a multi-mind zetteling process. Well we want to have some kind of consensus for a zettel. Here we would want confirmations from the network. Reaching some kind of consensus.
                - {{[[youtube]]: https://youtu.be/gP5zcHD8tJU}}
            - How can I do this in my personal [[zettelkasten]]?
                - I will make an **assertion** of a zettel. These [[assertions]] I will share with people I know and trust for giving an honest opinion on this assertion. I will then record who gave [[confirmations]] on the [[assertions]] I have made. The more confirmations the more this assertion persists and the harder it is for me to remove. Perhaps the only way for me to remove an assertion is to have another assertion replace it. Asserting a new fact and retracting the old one. I never delete. This gives me a very granular audit trail of old assertions that were retracted which I can view across time.

            - I have given a bit of thought to a literature note already.
                - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] The `Literature Notes` are non-relational outside the scope of the content. Whereas `Fleeting Notes`, `Intermediary Notes`, and `Permanent Notes` are relational across the boundaries of the content being analysed."
                - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] The `Literature Notes` is locally scoped to the material. Whereas `Fleeting Notes`, `Intermediary Notes`, and `Permanent Notes` are globally scoped."
                - Though I think these still lack clarity. 
                    - Scoping is more of an abstract term and I would prefer this kind of a definition or explanation to be more intuitive for others. So now I am thinking I explain it with relationships. 
                        - This is a much more intuitive explanation for instance. 
                            - "Think of it like being at a dinner party, the `Permanent Notes` is the thrilling conversation you're having with a mentor, while the `Intermediary Notes` are the milder chats with friends, and finally the `Fleeting Notes` could be considered the small-talk that "could" lead to something more akin to what you think of as important in YOUR life"
                    - So I think how I would explain the difference would be. 
                        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The literature note has a one-to-one relationship with the material. A permanent note has a one-to-many relationship and expands beyond the boundaries of the material. Both of them form the strongest relationships of their type. 
                        - I would use literature notes mostly to compose bullet form summaries of the material
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The literature note is observational. Whilst the fleeting note and permanent note are conversational.

        - #Chat [[Wade Dominic]] I both agree and disagree with your approach here. [[November 10th, 2020]]
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] I think what we need is [[Zettelkasten in Roam Recipe List]]. In programming we have open source **cook books** for example [Clojure Cookbook](http://clojure-cookbook.com/). 
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A recipe book doesn't help you create a new culinary dish. Just the same way that a cookbook for a programming language won't provide you the exact recipe to create your new application. But it helps you to get started with cooking. It lowers the "Activation energy" required to turn it into a daily practice or to start the work in the first place.
                    - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] [[~Wade Dominic]] I've been wrestling with what you're saying here, and the main reason I've been hesitant with the show-and-tell, is the proclivity for "smart" people to adopt a system in order to refine and adapt it for themselves. 
                        - I've seen that pattern re-surface over and over again, and my hopes is to slow the process down in order to let the answers come from within...
                        - Maybe it's incorrect, but at the moment with such a gold-rush towards having the answers, I'm okay with my decision.
                        - I desire to build a place of trust, first, then leading with insight only after that initial step is established.
                            - #Reply [[Wade Dominic]] [[~[[Beau Haan 📌]]]] I do see what you are saying here and can resonate with that. There is a huge difference between learning something from a book and learning from working with direct guidance from the expert.
                                - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] And I don't claim at all to be an expert~ I'm just another dude on the bus, but I've been down this street before, I suppose~
                        - As for the [cookbook](((wPf0dKztt))) analogy, in my opinion that presupposes that every has a working knowledge and mastery of the [brunoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunoise), the [five mother sauces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauce#French_cuisine), and a safe environment to be mentored and tested
                            - And if working in a Michelin-starred restaurant has shown me anything, it's that the standards for what is acceptable and unacceptable between the former and a "regular" restaurant--is glaringly obvious
                - I think some distortion is okay because when people hit that point that they realise it doesn't work for them. They can review what did and adapt it. Yes some will give up. Some will live with the distortion. Though some will be in enough pain to change it. People will show how they do it anyway. So when you show a recipe it allows others to see the differences and what resonates with them. What I would encourage is to definitely get people to pose that question of what they want out of it. As people generate different recipes then these could perhaps be curated somewhere so that there is no "one-true" way that people feel compelled to follow. 
                - I would hope that out of this book club and it's participants that some approaches emerge and we have a variations to demo how to do [[Zettelkasten in Roam]]

    - [[Introduction]]
        - ^^There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly.^^ But without an immediate experience of failure, there is also not much demand for help. And the publishing market working how it works, there is not much help in supply for this lack of demand either. It is the panic in front of the blank screen that brings students and academic writers to turn to the bookshelves full of self-help books on writing, a market publishers meet in droves by focusing on how to deal with this horse-has-already-left-the-barn situation. If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic and wonder why there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them. And even then, it is more likely that some form of rationalization will cloud the view of the actual reason, which is most likely the difference between good and bad note-taking. “Some people are just like that,” “writing has to be difficult,” “the struggle is part of the deal” are just a few of the mantras that keep too many from inquiring what exactly distinguishes successful writing strategies from less successful ones.  [*](((1NqxVWlvh)))
            - #quote ... note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A possible way to counter the lack of immediate feedback on the quality of a note is to establish a support group of 3-6 people that reviews permanent notes.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This would create an intermediary step between a note becoming a permanent note and actually being entered into the slip-box.
                    - #Chat [[Wade Dominic]] is this how you use #[[Intermediary Notes]]? [[November 9th, 2020]]
                        - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] Exactly, a place between two encompassing steps. Also the idea can extend into a place where building blocks are put so as not to disturb the core-conversation taking place in the `Permanent Notes`
                            - Think of it like being at a dinner party, the `Permanent Notes` is the thrilling conversation you're having with a mentor, while the `Intermediary Notes` are the milder chats with friends, and finally the `Fleeting Notes` could be considered the small-talk that "could" lead to something more akin to what you think of as important in YOUR life
                                - #Reply [[Wade Dominic]] this analogy of the different layers of conversation are exactly what came to mind when I was reading the parent of this block 
                                - #Reply [[Wade Dominic]] this cements it so much more for me with this analogy. I can now also see how I view the #[[Literature Notes]]

                                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The `Literature Notes` are non-relational outside the scope of the content. Whereas `Fleeting Notes`, `Intermediary Notes`, and `Permanent Notes` are relational across the boundaries of the content being analysed.
                                        - To give an analogy. `Literature Note` would be your comments on a particular piece of an artist. Whereas the other notes would be how it relates to other pieces of that artist, other artists, or society.
                                    - [[November 10th, 2020]] 
                                        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The `Literature Notes` is locally scoped to the material. Whereas `Fleeting Notes`, `Intermediary Notes`, and `Permanent Notes` are globally scoped.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A regular review process without any additional context or explanations provided by the author of a note would sharpen the context independence and clarity of a note.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A review group gives you the [[Wisdom of the crowd]] inside your [[Zettelkasten]]
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Participation in the support group provides you a number of opportunities
                    - Greater confidence and trust in the quality of your permanent notes
                    - Sharpens your eye for what a quality note looks like
                    - Encourages deliberate practice by having accountability
                    - Insights across domains when reviewing notes of others
                        - You can then import that insight which stands on it's own and link it within your own [[Zettelkasten]]
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This is a similar process to what is seen in Academia with paper reviews. But at an **atomic** level.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[Wisdom of the crowd]] is slowly being applied to knowledge work but is still not that common. An example is [mob programming](https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/)
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] I'm thinking for this it would look something like
                    - Example #zettel #[[zettel review]]
                        - Clarity {{[[slider]]}} 
                    - After 3 people have reviewed it. Then it could be added as a quality permanent note.
        - Luckily, this is not the whole story. We know today that self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed. Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long-and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. ^^Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success.^^ This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play. [*](((tIetkYe5Q)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Regardless of how small. We always have some degree of influence over both our physical and mental environments.
            - #[[Literature Notes]] For knowledge work, having meaningful and well defined tasks. Combined with a process for writing and note-taking provides a mental environment with reduced need for willpower.
            - #quote Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Constructing personal environments that reduce or remove the need for willpower is a critical component for success.
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - ^^A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas.^^ By breaking down the amorphous task of “writing a paper” into small and clearly separated tasks, you can focus on one thing at a time, complete each in one go and move on to the next one (Chapter 3.1). ^^A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975)^^. Something like that does not happen by chance. [*](((N9B8GYzJr)))
            - #quote A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] I think structure and process can be used quite interchangably.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] An ideal structure is one that is minimal, flexible, and stable.
                    - **Minimal:** reduces the cognitive load to learn how to use the structure and the usage can become second nature
                    - **Flexible:** allows one to adapt to the context, explore, and be creative
                    - **Stable:** allows one to remove the burden of worry
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Interestingly this lines up a lot with the Clojure programming language. 
                    - It has a **minimal** core language and syntax. 
                    - It is **flexible** because you can work with partials of a program instead of defining a whole program up front. You can also run and modify parts of a live running program from within the program itself. Meta-programming allows you to construct your own domain specific language this adapting it to different contexts.
                    - It is incredibly** stable** when compared to other programming languages. So you can rely on the code you write working years later. Which is often not the case in other programming languages. This [article](((https://lambdaisland.com/blog/2019-08-07-advice-to-younger-self))) details this problem well 
                    - I also go into further detail in my blog post [The Clojure Mindshare](https://www.groundedsage.dev/posts/the-clojure-mindshare/)
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] I'm thinking about energy levels and how it relates to willpower and mental resources/capacity. In my mind there is 3 different types of personal energy needed for any activity.
                    - Activation energy
                    - Constant energy
                    - Cumulative energy
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] 
                    - A [minimal](((XMCmfmhbE))) structure results in lower required activation energy. Once grokked it has only a constant energy requirement.

                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [Worry](((2V6R5ws_R))) to me is a cumulative drain on mental energy. In some cases it can be constant. But more often than not worry eats away at our minds. Increasingly draining us the longer that worry persists across time.

        - ^^Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower.^^ This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement–which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception. Even though planning is often at odds with the very idea of research and learning, it is the mantra of most study guides and self-help books on academic writing. How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated? It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. ^^We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery–or insight.^^ [*](((e5t8EGtoY)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] How do we more clearly define the difference between a process that is open ended and one that is not? This seems very important.

            - #[[Literature Notes]] Planning is unsuitable for open ended processes
            - #[[Literature Notes]] A plan that allows too many or an unlimited/undetermined amount of unknown variables significantly decreases the [stability](((2V6R5ws_R))) of the structure the plan imposes.

                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] It's interesting to draw comparisons between Dynamic and Typed programming here. Typed programming pushes people more towards planning and imposes structure. Whereas Dynamic programming is one that has less structure imposed on you.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] There is this common saying that "those without a plan, plan to fail" or "no plan is a plan". Lack of planning is often seen as a negative. I think this distinction between working with a plan and working with a structure is very critical. It needs to be clear.
            - #quote We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery–or insight.
                - #[[Literature Notes]] It is best to avoid or reduce our dependence on a plan that can be threatened by a new idea, discovery or insight. 
        - Unfortunately, even universities try to turn students into planners. Sure, planning will get you through your exams if you stick to them and push through. But it will not make you an expert in the art of learning/ writing/ note-taking (there is research on that: cf. Chapter 1.3). ^^Planners are also unlikely to continue with their studies after they finish their examinations. They are rather glad it is over. Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas. ^^The fact that you invested in this book tells me that you would rather be an expert than a planner. [*](((Afolfm8fD)))
            - #[[Literature Notes]] Just depending on planning will never make you an expert in the field of knowledge work.
            - #[[Literature Notes]] Knowledge work planners often suspend their research and learning once the deliverables expected of them have been delivered.
            - #[[Literature Notes]] Expert knowledge works see the reward in continued research and learning. The benefits are cumulative, often compounding. Raising the complexity level in which flow states can be reached.
        - Poor students do not have any of these problems. As long as they stick within the boundaries of their discipline and read only as much as they are told to (or less), no serious external system is required and writing can be done by sticking with the usual formulas of “how to write a scientific paper.” In fact, poor students often feel more successful (until they are tested), because they don’t experience much self-doubt. In psychology, this is known as the Dunning-Kruger effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). ^^Poor students lack insight into their own limitations–as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison.^^ That means that those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities. Poor students also have no trouble finding a question to write about: they neither lack opinions nor the confidence that they have already thought them through. They also won’t have trouble finding confirming evidence in the literature as they usually lack both interest and skill to detect and think through dis-confirming facts and arguments. [*](((LTX79DEgy)))
        - ^^Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven’t learned and mastered yet.^^ This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are (Clance and Imes 1978; Brems et al. 1994). This book is for you, the good students, ambitious academics and curious nonfiction writers who understand that insight doesn’t come easy and that writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing. [*](((Y0L49bjII)))
            - #quote Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven’t learned and mastered yet.
                - #[[Literature Notes]] Good students are the ones with a [[Growth Mindset]]
        - People still search for Luhmann’s “secret,” putting down his remarkable output to him being a genius or even thinking they only need his slip-box and they would be set. ^^Sure, you need to be smart to be successful in academia and writing, but if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just can’t be compensated by a high IQ.^^ [*](((_4c4iQ4E2)))
            - #[[Literature Notes]] All knowledge workers need an external system to think in. Without it they are destined to a pretty hard limit in what they can achieve.
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Any work that requires creative output requires an external system. Most artists carry around a sketchbook. Song writers also carry note-books. Chefs write down the outcome of their experiments the same way that scientists do.
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This is more of a discussion around [[Metacognition]] I think. Those that wish to be the best they can be will think about the way they work and optimise think about how they use external tools to process their thinking and try and optimise it.

I have a tendency to overthink and spend time concentrating on a piece of literature until I understand it. I have written comments on that but I somehow think that fleeting notes are meant for more aha moments whilst reading through material rather than taking time to reread it. 
        - I think the main problem is more to do with the fact that I haven't really practiced reading literature with serious intention (other than articles) for the majority of my life. Plus I never really took notes either (because I didn't know about Zettelkasten!). So I need to practice more on the reading and the taking notes side. Then through this process the distinction between the two will become more clear and fluid. 
    - It is important to consider that it is difficult to unlearn bad habits when constructing new habits. So one must start with the mindset of developing good habits from the beginning even if this is more difficult and take more time up front. [*](((x5hx3y9ay)))
