        - Section 1 Writing Task
            - Reflection on first reading phase of the book 
                - "What ideas resonate with you from the book"
                    - The importance of actively engaging with the material you are reading. The idea of 'reading with a pen in hand' resonated with me
                        - It reminds me to be intentional with my reading
                    - "What is the gist of the book? "
                        - Actively reading and investing time in note taking while reading material will provide building blocks that will make it easier to generate output
                - Discuss the fleeting note phase
                    - "What does the concept of fleeting notes mean to you? "
                        - Capturing text or a sentiment while reading a book that is potentially worth revisiting or thinking deeper about at a later stage
                    - Define a fleeting note in your own words. 
                        - Quick Capture of items you want to review at a later date
                    - "How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method."
                        - Dedicated time reading a book and writing down any items that I find interesting, novel or that I disagree with
                    - "What is the value of fleeting notes?  For this book, and for previous books you have read? "
                        - Serves as memory prompts for ideas or concept that you would like to review at a later date

            - "I was trying to think through this as seen below. But the above is really an AHA moment for me."
                - ""What I have in mind is unlike the old Zettelkasten where it was impossible to get a whole overview of it. In this medium I think you can get pretty close. One could trace through their permanent notes marking them as reviewed with a datestamp. Then you could pick this up at any point in time in the future and filter out the ones you have already reviewed, their review stage or review date ranges. Although I am yet to thoroughly think this through. Some possible markers could be something like `checked`, `open to more links`, `archive` or `up for deletion`. This tracing process would provide the opportunity to review the quality of your zettels and their connections in a systematic way. Sometimes you may not know how a zettel connects to another and only upon seeing it after reviewing a bunch of others you have made would that connection become clear. I would treat the `archive` tag with care or `up for deletion` tag with extreme caution. But having these here would allow you to ensure the quality of your zettelkasten over time with the ability to filter them out. ""

            - "Now how to we bring this to a multi-mind zetteling process. Well we want to have some kind of consensus for a zettel. Here we would want confirmations from the network. Reaching some kind of consensus."
                - "{{[[youtube]]: https://youtu.be/gP5zcHD8tJU}}"
            - "How can I do this in my personal [[zettelkasten]]?"
                - "I will make an **assertion** of a zettel. These [[assertions]] I will share with people I know and trust for giving an honest opinion on this assertion. I will then record who gave [[confirmations]] on the [[assertions]] I have made. The more confirmations the more this assertion persists and the harder it is for me to remove. Perhaps the only way for me to remove an assertion is to have another assertion replace it. Asserting a new fact and retracting the old one. I never delete. This gives me a very granular audit trail of old assertions that were retracted which I can view across time."
            - "Unifying the [[zettelkasten]] with the way a database works provides much more sophisticated query capabilities."
    - Idea against tag-frenzy [*](((UjeoZyqmz))) [*](((U3GpfkU6h))) 
        - Greater emphasis on tagging between permanent notes rather than to index --> this makes us go down well travelled paths of thought and reduces the chance for identifying new connections or ideas. Another plus point, is reducing friction of need to organise everything up front
    - Zettel questions
        - "Yes ... for me questions often feel so "important" that I want to make them their own category. I've experimented with calling them "Zettelquestions". I think they are a different form of "organizer" entirely - not statements about what we DO know or what we DO feel comfortable asserting, but rather, pointers of our active curiosity, illuminating the things we do not yet know. "
            - "In that sense, I think they are closer to what I am calling "Permanent Notes" in the nomenclature - which is to say, I grant them provisional permanence within the evolving slip-box - but I like to think of them as their own category."

                    - Personal #goal for me within this Roam Book Club is to become a better writer
            - Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly ^^makes you do everything else differently^^. "#quote Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus". You will not waste your time with the attempt to figure out what you “should” learn. Rather, you will try to learn as efficiently as possible so you can quickly get to the point where actual open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about. You quickly learn to distinguish good-sounding arguments from actual good ones, as you will have to think them through whenever you try to write them down and connect them with your previous knowledge. It will change the way you read as well: You will become more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannot write down everything. You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don’t understand what it is about. By doing this, you will elaborate on the meaning, which will make it much more likely that you will remember it. You also have to think beyond the things you read, because you need to turn it into something new. And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008). If you change your mind about the importance of writing, you will also change your mind about everything else. Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing.
