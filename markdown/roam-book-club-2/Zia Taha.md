- **About me:** I do science for a living.
- Plan::
    - Stage 1::
        - Read the book and take fleeting notes. That is, read the book and highlight the passages that appeal to you. In the following weeks, we will think about what we read more deeply, and reference blocks from the book in our writing.
    - Stage 2::
        - Block reference passages from the book in your own page, and write your own summaries and commentaries below them.

            - [[Goals for Book Club]]
                - Learn the Zettelkasten method for note-taking. Others mention it took them a couple of times to "get it", so it appears there is more to Zettelkasten than what I see on the surface. I want to make sure I am not missing anything important.
                - Get acquainted with Roam functionality and understand what it has to offer. Until today, I pretty much only use links and basic formatting.
                - Get used to reading and writing more.
                - Get exposed to how others think, learn, etc.
                - Network with #roamcult and make new connections. 
                - Learn how to use Roam for structuring and tracking my goals.
                - Finish reading [[How to Take Smart Notes]] before the end of November.

        - "Reflection on first reading phase of the book "
            - "What ideas resonate with you from the book"
                - It resonates with the process of writing a thesis:
                    - Taking notes while reading a paper - fleeting notes
                    - Summarizing a paper using one's own words - literature notes
                    - Writing a thesis - permanent notes
                - "What is the gist of the book? "
                    - The book describes the [[Zettelkasten]] method for note taking.
            - "Discuss the fleeting note phase"
                - "What does the concept of fleeting notes mean to you? "
                    - It resonates for me with the __diffuse mode__ of learning that is taught about in the [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/learning-how-to-learn/introduction-to-the-focused-and-diffuse-modes-75EsZ) course.
                - "Define a fleeting note in your own words. "
                    - Fleeting notes are __raw__ notes taken while reading.
                - "How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method."
                    - When I read physical books, if a part stands out I will either highlight/underline that part, or write it down on a small sheet of thin paper I can insert in the book. Now that I do most of my reading on my laptop, I write my fleeting notes in Evernote.
                - "What is the value of fleeting notes?  For this book, and for previous books you have read? "
                    - Fleeting notes are the precursor to the __literature notes__, which correspond with the __focused mode__ that is taught about in the [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/learning-how-to-learn/introduction-to-the-focused-and-diffuse-modes-75EsZ) course.
        - "[[Breakout Session]]"
        - "{{[[DONE]]}} **Section 4 Graph meditation **"
            - I am not sure I am as acquainted with Roam's intermediate-advanced functionality as I like.
            - Why does the [[Graph Overview]] look different here?
            - How do other people organize and structure their pages?
            - What is the chat for?
    - [[November 9th, 2020]]
        - The slash autocomplete command `/` is extremely useful.
        - Clicking the star button at the top right of a page adds it to the shortcuts list on the left.
        - Created [[Zia Taha: Sandbox]] to experiment with bidirectional linking.
        - What is the difference between block referencing and block embedding?
            - This is a block reference:
                - "A common form of [[Lorem Ipsum]] reads:"
            - This is a block embedding:
                - {{embed: ((pckG0z9oR))}}
        - What is an alias?
            - This is an example of an {{alias:[[Zia Taha: Sandbox]]alias}}.
            - What is an alias good for? Why not just use [links]([[Zia Taha: Sandbox]])?
