            - Changing our behavior is best done by first understanding common obstacles to behavioral change. The challenge is overcoming the sense of control we have through repeated behavior, regardless of the effectiveness of that behavior.[*](((x5hx3y9ay)))

- Fleeting Notes:: 
- [[Writing Prompts]]
    - "What does it mean to elaborate on something you've read? What sort of elaboration techniques work best while reading?"
        - Interesting question. As a researcher, I elaborate in various ways. I may compare something I've read to something else that's similar, or that's different, and explore how they are related. I may select adjacent ideas and explore how the current reading relates and expands on the adjacent concept. Does it build on it? Does it alter the significance? Supports the idea, or detracts from it? Does it lead away from the core idea into different paradigms?  At the end of the day, however, elaboration is the key process to [[writing as thinking]].
    - "Does it matter if you don't take notes on a book?"
        - Depends on the book. Fiction, probably doesn't matter for the most part, although there can be insights worthy of capture. Non-fiction books, if it's for entertainment, again, probably doesn't matter. However, if it's a book meant to expand your thinking, then yes, because in that case [[writing as thinking]] is the product of taking notes on what's been read.
    - "Write about the best book you have ever read, and what made it great. What does this book need to do, to be similar?"
        - I've read a number of excellent academic texts and what makes them stand out is the effort in framing the chapter with front and back matter that essentally tells me what it's going to cover, covers the material, and then closes by telling me what it covered. The last section is the most valuable because in essence, it #zettels the chapter for me.
    - "What's going to change after reading this book?"
        - Hopefully, it will further reduce my friction in note taking, synthesizing, and elaborating, so I can get further with my writing.

    - [[Writing Prompts]]
        - "How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method."
            - Read the book in Kindle, highlighting sections that resonated. Did not take down thoughts unless tey were significant enough that I wanted to recall my reaction and response later. This did not occur very often though. Used Readwise sync to extract those highlights to my Roam database for later processing.
        - "Define a fleeting note in your own words. "
            - A highlight or brief annotation that marks a passage or excerpt that resonates at the moment. I do not do a thorough analysis into exactly what resonated or what my thoughts are regarding the highlight, just note it for revisiting when processing later. Often, I find my fleeting notes are things I want to recall, but that there's no further processing needed. Those stay as fleeting notes indefinitely.
        - ""What is the value of fleeting notes?  For this book, and for previous books you have read? ""
            - They give me a glimpse on the first pass of a book what I'm thinking about, what matters to me at that reading. Often, when re-reading a book, I'll have different fleeting notes because I'm in a different mindset with the issues I'm grappling with that the book supports. So fleeting notes help me understand what I'm focusing on and how it overlaps with what I'm reading. They also trigger deeper contemplation about the bigger ideas espoused in the text. I often can't dive right into a hefty concept without a bit of framing, and fleeting notes provide that framing. They limber me up so I can access the meatier parts and stick with them long enough to pick out the juicy bits for permanent capture.
    - #Chat [[Gamified Randomization of Fleeting Notes]]
        - Per request, here are the various techniques I use to randomize my fleeting notes to interact with them, process them, clean them up, and percolate serendipitous insights:
            - [oschmid/roam-plugins](https://github.com/oschmid/roam-plugins/blob/master/random-page-plugin.js) - pulls a random page from All Pages
                - RoamHacker seems to be working on a more elegant version of this functionality, per a Nov 1 thread in Roam Slack
            - Charlie Mead's Random Block remixer
                - Currently only grabs first-level children, but including nested blocks is on his list of improvements, per a Roam slack comment
                - Charlie first introduced this in Roam Book Club v1. Here's a video demo: https://www.loom.com/share/8ddc1f9a0a4a44d0806d03b206b93d49
                - Here's the Roam Book Club v1 page for [RBC/Block Remixer](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/roam-book-club/page/gl7T8N7D-)
            - [David Vargas script](https://roam.davidvargas.me/extensions/query-tools/) to to enable query to return "n" randomly chosen results for any desired "n", then:
                - Include in morning TextExpander script to query a page of choice, or combination of values, then use David Vargas "n" script to pare query down to managable chunk. Useful for interacting with the last book I read, or a series of articles, or Readwise highlights, etc.
                - [Roam Toolkit](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-toolkit/ebckolanhdjilblnkcgcgifaikppnhba?hl=en-US) browser extension's randomization functions; drops links to pages into the current page. Then I use David Vargas "n" script to see what pops up from that page.
                    - ctl + shft + / = random page in main window
                    - ctl + shft + windows key + / = random page in left sidebar

        - "Define a literature note in your own words."
            - Rephrasing what has been said by someone else in my own words. Does not include any of my own insights yet.
        - "How do you take literature notes? Discuss your method."
            - 1) review highlighted [[Fleeting Notes]]
            - 2) copy the excerpt I want to summarize.
            - 3) indent below the block, insert the quoted excerpt (prefixed with #quote)
            - 4) paste the quoted excerpt
            - 5) indent below the quote, prefix with #LN, and summarize / rehrase in my own words
        - "Have you found value in taking literature notes already?"
            - Absolutely, and in Roam Research, 10x factor value. Sweeping through and linking to concepts, theories, authors, and creators, that alone gives me heightened value. Writing summaries aids in developing annotated bibliographies, I hardly have to write more for those types of academic products. And outline new academic papers is becoming easier simply using litnotes in my own words.
        - "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?"
            - Largely time. It's the first obstacle to working with new material, and presents the greatest friction. Once I have a literature note in my own words, the process becomes more my own, and thus more fun. But jumping the hurdle to dedicate time to integrate someone else's thoughts into my own process takes deep work, and in my environment, that's difficult to schedule.
        - "Describe any enlightening moments you had while taking literature notes."
            - Working with the raw material makes it sticky, and primes my brain to actively look for patterns to link to and write about, instead of passively spotting them as I read and take fleeting notes. I've connected ideas in passing, but working with literature notes makes it feel almost like the ideas connect themselves and I'm just the scribe jotting them down.
- [[November 22nd, 2020]]
    - "Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? "
        - Difficult for a couple reasons. Flow state takes time, and finding blocks of time is challenging. Also, this is a new skill, and feels clunky, thus it's more effortful than once the skill is mastered. Still, the more I practice this work, the easier it gets.
    - "Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way? "
        - Very useful. They force a degree of thinking that isn't commonly employed when skimming or reading without interacting with the text. My understanding changes when I blend what the text says with what I actively think about what the text says.
    - "Explain what a permanent note is in your own words?"
        -  A foundational concept, idea, or thought, that is supported by many other literature notes. An archetype, if you will, that is generalizable across multiple domains.
    - "What is holding you back from creating zettels?"
        - Not having processed enough text to amass enough literature notes to support zettels.
