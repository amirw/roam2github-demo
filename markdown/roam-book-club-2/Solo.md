    - First time I've joined a book club. Love the idea and the novel concept (for me!) of "thinking in public".
    - I read mostly on physical books. I'll use my Kindle occasionally for fiction or when traveling but to me there's really no substitute for the joy of handling the spacial awareness of a physical book. It could just be motivated reasoning but I feel that I retain more and engage deeper with a book when I'm holding it. I also tend to highlight excessively and carelessly on Kindle simply because it's so easy to do. Traditional marginalia tempers my inordinate highlighting impulses.
