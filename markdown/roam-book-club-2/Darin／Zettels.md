            - This [Aeon essay](https://aeon.co/essays/how-can-duchamp-s-fountain-be-both-art-and-not-art) reflects on the idea behind this Zettel and credits Duchamp's 1917 "Fountain". "As an aside, our local science center has a water fountain [](https://twitter.com/RCElementary/status/804005755523252224?s=20) that's probably inspired by Marcel Duchamp's 1917 installation "Fountain" ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dd/Marcel_Duchamp%2C_1917%2C_Fountain%2C_photograph_by_Alfred_Stieglitz.jpg) which makes a closely related point: [[It's possible to be and not be something]]."
            - This notion is also echoed in Magritte's 1929 painting ![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg)

        - #Zettels [[The more we use something, the less we think of what it is or how it looks]]
            - This tendency, called [[functional fixity]] or [[functional fixedness]] (Duncker 1945), is a corollary of the fact that [[Things are defined by how they're used, not by what they are]].
                - Duncker, K. (1945). "On problem solving". __Psychological Monographs__, 58:5 (no. 270).
            - [[Steven Pinker]] warns that [[functional fixity]] has nefarious consequences for [[writing]]. It's largely responsible for
                - "why specialists use so much idiosyncratic terminology, together with abstractions, metaconcepts, and zombie nouns. They are not trying to bamboozle us; that's just the way they think." ([[Steven Pinker]], Sense of Style, p. 71)
            - Specifically, [[functional fixity]] interferes directly with a [[classic style of writing]]:
                - "A writer of classic prose must simulate ... showing the reader something in the world... The metaphor of showing implies that there is something to see. The things in the world the writer is pointing to, then, are concrete: people (or other animate beings) who move around in the world and interact with objects."  ([[Steven Pinker]], Sense of Style, p. 29; see also p. 74)
        - #Zettels [[It's hard to tease apart objective experiences from how we think, know or judge them to be]]
            - Psychologist [[Edward Titchener]] called this the [[stimulus error]]; see e.g. [Hatfield (2015)](https://journals.openedition.org/philosophiascientiae/1133)

        - #Zettels [[Are you experienced? Give yourself the experience of connecting ideas, facts, and arguments across your notes so you develop an urge for that experience, and you're golden]]
            - #[[Literature Notes]] [Chapter 14. (Paragraph 6))](((4hIM0I_l_)))
                - Instead of forcing yourself to change, let yourself experience the feeling of making connections across your notes — observe how your literature notes and permanent notes complement, correct, or feed into each other — so you can develop an urge to experience that feeling again and again, which will move your work forward, and make you feel bad for others who aren't in the same work space.

                - "I made a few #[[Permanent notes]] but tried creating a couple of [[Zettles]] only today. I was immediately struck by how the Zettel I created lead to my creating another Zettel, and both were anchored to [[Literature Notes]]"
