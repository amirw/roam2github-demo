- Fleeting Notes:: 
    - "I think the analysis of why a [[Zettelkasten]] overcomes the limitations of the mind is flawed"
        - "if we want to increase our learning and understanding, then we should, as much as possible, focus on [[retrieval practice]] and NOT writing per se"
            - "source: [Blunt, Karpicke. Retrieval practice with concept mappinig](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0130/2b7670c540cdea04878d697feaa65959f6c9.pdf)"
        - "it is important not to MERELY reread permanent notes, but first to try to create them (retrieval practice through self-testing) and only to read them subsequent to the testing"
