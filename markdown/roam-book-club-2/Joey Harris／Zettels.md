            - Some reactions require energy and other reactions produce energy. Work processes are the same. A state of flow is achieved when one releases and expresses one's concentrated expertise. This is liberating rather than constraining. Rather than feeling like effortful labour, working in flow feels more like play.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]]True flow comes from a triggered release of energy; the free expression of one's concentrated expertise.
            - Explosions
                - Are release of energy, expression of freedom
                    - Being free from a more constrained state
                    - Outward
                - fission vs fusion
                    - Related to the text
                    - Back to energy
                        - A little bit in, a lot of energy out
                        - A little bit in, an infinite energy

            - Friction vs frictionless
                - Workflow
                    - Friction slows you down, stops and hinders
                    - Frictionless is a state of flow
