        - Our group question for SÃ¶nke Ahrens::
(#[[question for Soenke]])
            - **What do you think about the Roam Research and the recent proliferation of tools for thought that are directly or indirectly inspired by How to Take Smart Notes and Zettelkasten?**
            - What is your academic project? Is there public information about it? How does it relate to How to Take Smart Notes?
            - What tools for thought do you use?
            - Do you use more then one tool? How do you integrate them?
            - How do you create a process for transferring fleeting notes to permanent notes?
- Week 1
    - {{[[TODO]]}}  Read How to Take Smart Notes and take fleeting notes
- Session Notes
    - [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
        - My [[Goals of Book Club]]
            - A deeper understanding of Zettelkasten and the ideas in How to Take Smart Notes
            - Practice developing and using my own Zettelkasten
            - A deeper understanding of Zettelkasten
            - Practice putting the system into practice
        - Sonke Ahrens on How to Take Smart Notes [[Fleeting Notes]]
            - Read a book at different levels e.g. highlights, deep notes, public
            - Started as a spinoff of a larger project and something that Sonke was generally interested in himself
            - Roam Research resonates - "Ideas have their time"
            - Luhmann speaks of zettelkasten as a dialoge partner
            - Sonke /Zonka/
            - Humility about understanding, when we right it down we realize the shortcomings of our understanding.
            - Digital versus handwriting is not an either or question. You need both tools and you need to know when to use them
            - Roam has the advantage of removing friction. It gets out of the way
            - A typical problem with software is that you think more about the software than the problem, writing.
            - The net benefit is with software for Sonke
            - Sonke has thought he has the need to immerse himself deeply in the topic and highlight to take notes later.
            - Sometimes a question or objective requires the full attention that doesn't fit into a routine.
            - A routine should be the default that you come back to, flexibility is more important than a rigid routine.
            - How should we read the book and take notes with it? Advice
                - What is my goal for reading the book?
                    - To begin to develop my own Zettelkasten
            - The main difference with Roam vs. Zettelkasten
                - Roam, much longer notes because of the granularity at the block level
                - The note sequences, notes that are densely connected, can be written in one note. If they are densely connected, they can be one note
                - Distinguish between hash tag one word, it is a link to a page witch is more like an index entry, directory
                - This is in contrast to double bracket links that link to standalone or entry points for notes
                - How does this relate to tags?
            - Individual vs collective zettelkasten
                - The acquaintance analogy is well-suited here
                - 
    - [[Book Club Live Session 2]]
        - Group 4 Breakout Notes
        - Luca Dellanna
            - Publish book with Roam so that the reader can do more with it
            - Iâ€™ve always been looking for new formats for my content - looking for modularity of concepts above all.

When I tried Roam I got really excited - for it allowed modularity and connection.

Thatâ€™s IMHO the best format to consume and use knowledge.

        - Writing is a fundamental tool for thinking.
        - Thinking is non-linaer and therefore writing should be non-linear.
        - Since there are many different types of writing tasks, they should be differentiated and worked on explicitly. Distinguishing different types of tasks in the writing process is important for making progress.
            - Tasks
                - Thinking

                - Checking facts
                - Researching relevant sources (This can be a recursive process that mirrors the main writing process)

                - Referencing sources
                - Choosing the right words and phrases
