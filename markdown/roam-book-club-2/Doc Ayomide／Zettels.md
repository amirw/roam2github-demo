        - #[[Literature Notes]] Simplicity is the parent of complexity, not its antithesis. 
            - The existence of complexity is precisely why simplicity is necessary: by keeping things simple, we are able to not only navigate complexity more confidently, but can also go on to create even more sustainable complex structures, while maintaining a clear understanding of both what we built and the process by which we built it.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Simplicity is what makes complexity possible, but this is counterintuitive, and leads us to unnecessarily complicate things.
            - The simpler we start, the more complex structures we can build 
                - think fractals
                - the mistake we often make is to imagine that complexity requires complication 
                - we want complexity at the end, not the beginning—in the outcome/product, not the process
                - this is the deceptiveness of simplicity: and why it is not easy—why people on the outside looking in don’t believe it’s “really that simple”
