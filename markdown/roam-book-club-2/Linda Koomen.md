        - The specs of the book, article etc. Titel, author, etc.
    - How do you take literature notes?
        - I make them out of the fleeting notes I made in the book or on a indexcard
    - Have you found value in taking literature notes?
        - I'm not sure. Isn't it much more logical to make permanent notes right away?
    - What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?
