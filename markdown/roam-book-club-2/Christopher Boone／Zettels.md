            - Exergonic reactions require external energy.
Endergonic reactions create their own energy.
            - The goal is a workflow that is self-perpetuating.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Self-perpetuating workflows are endergonic rather than exergonic. They can help avoid procrastination.
            - The goal is to not waste energy. A system/loop will be inefficient if it requires external energy to keep it going. The loop will self-perpetuate if it creates its own energy. However, it's not necessarily good for a loop to be self-perpetuating. If the components are negative that

- Exergonic vs. Endergonic Reactions
    - Exergonic requires new energy input whereas endergonic creates its own energy and is self-perpetuating.
