    - He realised that one idea, one note was only as valuable as its context, which was not necessarily the context it was taken from. So he started to think about how one idea could relate and contribute to different contexts.[*](((BjFRHwXXy)))

    - general definition
        - #Zettels[[an entity has been exapted if and only if its current utility differs from its original utility]]
    - specific definition for [[Zettelkasten]]
        - #Zettels [[an idea that was originally useful in one context, and which is later used in a different context, has been exapted]]
    - statement of fact
        - #Zettels [[a [[Zettelkasten]] takes an idea out of its original context and puts it in a different context]]
    - conclusion
        - [[a [[Zettelkasten]] is an exaptation-generating machine]]
    - in any Darwinian system we can distinguish two kinds of exaptation
        - weak
            - statement of analogical facts
                - #Zettels [[just as it could be the case that some life is in the terrestrial biosphere and different life is in the Martian biosphere, so some ideas are in my personal knowledge network (or [[Zettelkasten]]) and different ideas are in someone else's personal knowledge network]]
            - definition
                - #Zettels [[if human space travelers were to bring back a Martian microbe that remained isolated and dormant on Earth, that microbe would have a [[weak link]] to other terrestrial life by virtue of the fact that they share the same biosphere]]
                - #Zettels [[if someone were to put in their [[Zettelkasten]] a [[permanent note]] that replicated an idea expressed by a different person, and that note was not connected to any other note in their Zettelkasten, then that note would have a [[weak link]] to the other notes in that Zettelkasten]]
        - strong
            - statement of analogical facts
                - #Zettels [[just as some life forms in a given biosphere exert effects on other life forms in that biosphere, and also have effects exerted on them by other life forms in that biosphere, so some ideas in my [[Zettelkasten]] are related via links to other ideas in my Zettelkasten]]
            - definitions
                - #Zettels [[if a life form exerts on another life form, or has exerted upon it by another life form, an effect, then there is a [[strong link]] between those life forms]]
                - #Zettels [[by making an explicit connection between one [[permanent note]] in my [[Zettelkasten]] and another, I am creating a [[strong link]] between them]]
    - why is this important? why care?
        - #Zettels [[the law of the [[weak link]]: the potential creative value of a connection between one group of [[permanent note]]s and another group is inversely proportional to the number of already-existing connections between those groups]]
