    - ## Notes
        - Great quotes
            - "You're probably many decisions away from success, but always one decision away from failure."
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] ""You're probably many decisions away from success, but always one decision away from failure.""
                - Risk and uncertainty in business that most people underestimate
                    - Especially with #Covid
                - The strategies are inadequate and the business fails or impaired
            - p60 OBECALP (placebo backwards) - a dose to overcome self doubts and build self confidence "Imagine, for a moment, that all your self-doubts are simply a function of society's immune system, designed to extinguish noncomforming actions."
            - "Startups win by being impatient over a long period of time."
            - "The future is drafted by people doing work they don't have to do." p92
            - "You need to manage your staff as a sports team, not family" p 127 - point is not accept them for who they are, like you would family, but for the sole purpose of winning.
            - "proactive changes that feel premature are far better than reactive changes that feel inflicted upon you....'The more voluntary suffering you build into your life, the less involuntary suffering will affect your life.'" p131
            - "while you may think assigning credit is about rewards, it's really about assigning influence for future decisions." p 148
        - **I like the analogy of the company having an immune system. when you bring in a new person to shake things up you have to suppress the immune system. but when a player no longer adds value or fits in a new role, you have to let the immune system work and eject them**
        - chapter - "Accomodate [[free radicals]]" is really interesting - pps 137-139. here's [Belsky's article](https://99u.adobe.com/articles/7098/a-manifesto-for-free-radicals-less-paperwork-less-waiting-more-action) from the Adobe website
        - importance of office space to create a collaberative and creative environment. I would love to work on the design of an office space for a team. that would be fun and meaningful, and to have the right art and other features.
        - interesting idea of a "done wall" to recognize accomplishments and success - not just the list of things that have to still get done #management
        - #delegation - people have to be able to clearly answer what their tasks/job are, but importantly in the context of the company vision
        - questions to ask to elicit better #delegation results
            - how did it go on a scale of 1-10
            - what should we have done differently
            - what worked suprisingly well
