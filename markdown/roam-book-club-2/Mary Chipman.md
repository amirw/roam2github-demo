- "What ideas resonate with you from the book"
    - The slip-box provides an [[external scaffold]] to think. 
        - Since thinking is the goal, and the computational prowess of the brain is immense, [[how does one create the most efficient scaffolding, given the immense array of software, etc. out there?]]
            - [[Question:]] Which scaffolding components belong in Roam, and which in, say, Dropbox, etc?
            - [[Question:]] How does one amass the content in article form after one is done?
    - [[Imposter syndrome]], a lifelong affliction. In my case this is related to negative thinking where my inner critic gets in the way of getting anything done.
        - quote: Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts.
            - If one is focused on the work, then thoughts flow, and the work continues unimpeded. Another common quote: "The perfect is the enemy of the good, which cycles back to imposter syndrome."
        - When your brain is telling you you are unworthy, the tendency is to procrastinate. 
            - quote: leaving us with fewer positive or even bad experiences like missed deadlines. We might end up in a [[vicious circle of failure]] 

        - If one is always judging oneself, it short-circuits the possibility of [[learning from failure]].
    - [[Live Session 5]] [[November 29th, 2020]]
        - "Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month. "
            - I've been digging into the source material to understand the underlying architecture of Roam.

- [[Questions for Sönke]]
    [[Mary Chipman]] My understanding of Luhmann's intent was that a zettelkasten should be hyper-textual, adhere to the principle of atomicity, and be personal. How does that square with a group zettelkasten as a tool for thought consisting of zettels from multiple contributors and multiple points of view?  
    [[Mary Chipman]] Luhmann's systems theories were influenced by Spencer-Brown and Karl Popper, whose work has been popularized by Nassim Nicholas Taleb, leading to glib references about Roam where author clearly did not understand falsifiability much less "anti-fragile", among others. What do you advise your students to do in their note-taking to avoid confirmation bias, groupthink and jargon? 
    "Questions for us from [[Sönke Ahrens]]"
        - "What have you learnt about note taking that I (Sönke) should know about?"
        - "Are there any additions to the process described in the book?"
            - For me personally it would have been helpful to have more on the mechanics of how Luhmann's analog system of numeric references translates into Roam block links. Also a discussion of how to work with external data sources and bibliographic reference tools such as Zotero.
        - "Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten?"
        - "(what use cases does it work for? Are there any examples it doesn't work for?)"
            - I'm interested in using a Roam zettelkasten for genealogical research, and I'm not sure if this is an example of it possibly not being the right tool for the following reasons.
                - Data from external sources is stored in different formats, such as gedcom.
                - How do you link person data, geographical data, historical data over an individual person's life span?
                    - 
    "General review questions "
        - "Reflect on your impressions of the book "
            - The gold standard, enormously helpful in grasping the underlying concepts for assimilating knowledge in a useful way.
        - "Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?"
            - I bought and read the book when I first started using Roam, and it changed the way I think about thinking and writing, particularly with regard to [[Daniel Kahnemann]]'s work in 'Thinking Fast and Slow'. It's made me slow down and examine my own epistemological arrogance in thinking that "I know". Now I'm not so sure I actually know as much as I thought I did when I have to put things into my own words.
        - "Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?  "
            - Yes, but I need to understand more about the underlying technologies first. My background is in relational database systems, creating secure n-tier applications, teaching, writing courseware and books on how to do this (I have been out of the tech world for 10 years, so I'm rusty on current technologies). 
            - Luhman's system evolved in phases as his thinking evolved, and I am in no rush to produce a final zettelkasten until I have a firm grasp of the fundamental concepts. I feel like the more I read about Luhmann and his work on systems then I will be more qualified to think about the underlying schema (or scaffolding) of my own 'tool for thought'.
