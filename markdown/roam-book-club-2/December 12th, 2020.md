- #Chat [[Chinarut]] #Announcement Exciting news everyone!  I hunkered down  and followed through on creating my first ‚Äúmanuscript‚Äù from a subset of my Zettels and submitted it as a writing sample of the research I am proposing to work on (potentially with [[Joel Chan]]) for the next 5 years in graduate school!
    - Invitation for everyone in book club to comment (you are all a big part of this!): ^^[How a Wellbeing Commons Works](https://www.notion.so/communitygarden/How-a-Wellbeing-Commons-Works-40db6c79b06849a9839481f983c85ec5)^^
        - "**Linear Argument** (post Zetteling, selected Zettels, extract concepts) [[December 5th, 2020]]"
        - "**Linear Outline** (sort major concepts/themes derived from Zettels)"
            - {{[[TODO]]}} cite quote in the book where he talks about having the outline for reference at all times so you stay focused on what **not** to write about because another section focus on these points later
    - please keep in mind this is only the **second** draft (at this time of writing) so it‚Äôs messy and still have to work on its flow.  My goal was to create a manuscript that would work towards a [[Statement of Purpose]] so I knew whatever I wrote is [[publishable insight]] (and intended to be shared :)
    - One of the more humbling things I discovered is there are gaps in the linear argument that came out of looking for patterns and clusters in my Zettels
        - after reading a blog post on the net, it is a **good** thing to demonstrate you have gaps to fill in or why would one have any context for research or learning any from graduate school in the first place?
            - ## **5) Your application essay shouldn‚Äôt have answers‚Äîit should ask questions.¬†**
                - ‚ÄúAdmissions committees don‚Äôt expect you to have all the answers in a given field. That‚Äôs why you‚Äôre applying to grad school, after all. But they do expect you to have smart questions. The age-old adage of identifying ^^‚Äúa¬†gap¬†in the literature‚Äù^^ has become trite in recent years. Instead, ^^ask concise, thoughtful questions about your area of interest, and explain how you hope to go about investigating them.^^ This implicitly ^^demonstrates that not only do you know there is a¬†gap¬†in the literature, but you have a plan about how you will fill that¬†gap.^^‚Äù [*](https://qz.com/950763/how-to-get-into-graduate-school-according-to-current-phd-students/)
            - now it is another thing as to whether I **effectively** explained the process in which I wish to go about my investigation üôÑü§ì
    - challenges transforming my Zettels in Roam into editable copy
        - I couldn‚Äôt access our book graph! (not being in the book graph for 5d felt like an eternity! lol)
            - {{[[TODO]]}} #support book-club-2 graph hung loading on iPadOS from 12/7-12/10 daily
                - IssueType:: #bug

                - Status:: opens today on 12/11 (yeay!)
                - left Roam icon spinning for hours with no avail
                - personal graph opens fine
                - js and css kill switches didn‚Äôt work
                - #workaround open on macOS
                - #workaround parked a snapshot of my slipbox in [@socialcommons/((IEBbksuM4))](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/socialcommons/page/IEBbksuM4)
                - hardware config: iPad Pro (2018) 256GB LTE iPad OS 14.2
                - #Chat [[Chinarut]] ok - made it back into the book graph again :)
                    - I‚Äôm in mobile Chrome on iPadOS
                    - I might need to clear my entire cache in Safari
                        - deleting individual website data didn‚Äôt work
                    - I use my website history so this was last resort from me
                    - clearing entire history/cache doesn‚Äôt help :/
        - When I exported my linear argument block, they were all block references to my slipbox so I couldn‚Äôt just massage text around :(
            - "**Linear Argument** (post Zetteling, selected Zettels, extract concepts) [[December 5th, 2020]]"
        - I ended up copying & pasting literal text (not block references) and realized implementing Zettels as pages makes removing the `[[` `]]` in the raw copy annoying (not wrong, just annoying)
            - #question why did we implement zettels as pages?
                - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] [[@[[Chinarut]]]] I think [[Andy Matuschak]] was the invisible influencer here, Zettels-as-pages maps onto the style of his digital garden and I think it allows later elaborations and connections to be collected in a single place, 
                    - ... though to be honest, with my shifting appreciation of blocks-as-the-fundamental-unit-of-Roam I am not fully sold on the idea that each Zettel should be a page. 

                    - Best format for Zettels is still an open question, IMO.
                - 
                - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] aha! that makes sense now.  I feel my future Zettels will definitely be more concise and fit well into the page-creation scheme which does parallel how I created my space in Notion over the summer.
                    - I think a book that moves us in the direction of ‚Äúwhat makes a well-formed Zettel?‚Äù and ‚Äúwhat does well-formed mean?‚Äù would be great and from my breakout today, I got the impression that Andy‚Äôs work focuses more on the Zettel side of things is what I‚Äôm told?
                    - #sidebar it‚Äôs been on my agenda to dive in more fully into Andy‚Äôs work - has anybody joined his ‚Äúinsider‚Äù club and have access to whatever platform he has built?
                    - one of the things I love about Roam is I don‚Äôt have to focus on ‚Äúpage creation‚Äù and that pages come into being on their own once you‚Äôve written enough about them in your daily notes (the block model is awesome indeed!)
                        - the model that we each have our own page here in the book club graph really works because it gave us our own flattened ‚Äúdaily notes‚Äù per se...
                        - now what was missing was the ability to block reference our own content as inspired by the reading.  (I‚Äôm aware [[Bardia Pourvakil]] mentioned intergraph block referencing is coming!)
                        - I just want it to be implemented in such a way that it‚Äôs fairly transparent (we shouldn‚Äôt have to think about as writers/tool users where the ‚Äúboundaries‚Äù are (well other than our slipbox üòâ which Sonke was very clear [[thinking inside the box]] can be a good thing!))
                        - I really look forward to an integrated daily notes model that spans/is aggregated across participants (yet still has the same net result as our book graph) (**and** has the wiggle space to entertain blocks that belong to the unknown/unsaid conversations you were great to share today! üëç)
                        - any book that would entertain the thought of exploring this [[space in between]] would be excellent too! (knowing that where I developed this inquiry is in a 9-month course called [[Partnership Explorations]]!)
        - I notice as I was ‚Äúfilling in the gaps‚Äù and writing copy to help transition the points in my argument from one zettel to the next, I didn‚Äôt want to lose traceability (ie. backlinking) as to which copy came from zettels and which copy was added.
            - I resorted to coloring my text: [How a Wellbeing Commons Works (raw rough, pre-first draft (Zettels colored in blue))](https://www.notion.so/communitygarden/SYN-How-a-Wellbeing-Commons-Works-186b00672536434885c909e681ec280d)
        - I now realize in retrospect, I am supposed to massage the text of my zettels so it better fits my argument (or change arguments!)
            - ‚Äú^^Don‚Äôt simply copy your notes into a manuscript.^^ Translate them into something coherent and embed them into the context of your argument while you build your argument out of the notes at the same time. Detect holes in your argument, fill them or change your argument.‚Äù [*](((1bH-TT58u)))
            - I allowed my concern for preserving backlinking to dominate (ie. I was attached to my zettels :)
    - So in conclusion, I look forward to how our club refines our [[manuscript writing process]] so we can stay in Roam Research
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] - [[Chinarut]] congratulations, this is so exciting! 
        - ( as an aside, the area you are writing about is also a wonderful topic for research IMO)
            - it makes me think of the [[Framingham Study]], which initially looked at risk factors for cardiac disease, but ultimately also became a treasure trove of information about how health behaviors travel through social networks - thus an early attempt to maybe map out the [[Wellness commons]] maybe?
                - awesome phrase - I love the concept of a [[Wellness commons]]
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] This is the awesome juice of research!  thank you so much for providing related references! Here is another [[Wellness commons]]-related paper i found halfway through book club I look forward to seeing how it debates with everything else :)
