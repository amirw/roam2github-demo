- Live Session 4
    - Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month. 
        - I reread this book to revisit the text and what I thought I took away from it
    - Reflect on your Zettel process
        - I thought I had created many zettels but realized they were not connected as required after a coaching/learning session with Beau - thank you Beau!
        - My zettel process was not working as explained by the author as I was having trouble finding related notes and connecting them whenever writing a new one, I was using a non-ideal method. 
        - I was rewording the author in my own words instead of finding what the author's writing made me think of and then capturing all those thoughts and then distilling my own thinking.
    - Why do you want a Zettelkasten?
        - capture and connect all my hard-won knowledge, generate new ideas to help to understand the world better.

        - "Pick from the prompts below and write in your own page for 25 minutes."
        - "Questions for us from [[Sönke Ahrens]]"
            - "What have you learnt about note taking that I (Sönke) should know about?"
                - A prescribed method for implementing a Zettlkasten in Roam would be nice, because of Roam's myriad options, it's error likely to create notes that haven't been connected as much as possible or necessary compared to ZKN3. software. A standardized way to create and connect Zettels would be helpful.
            - "Are there any additions to the process described in the book?"
                - follow-up book detailing the writing process for authoring books/reports from the Zettels. Your writing is crisp and clean and appreciated.  
            - "Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten?"
                - can really help see connections, only as good as its inputs, maintenance and the time spent working with it.
            - "(what use cases does it work for? Are there any examples it doesn't work for?)"
                - works great for personal knowledge management, [Roam] doesn't work for confidential work information
        - "General review questions "
            - "Reflect on your impressions of the book "
                - great resource that inspired me to take the few extra steps to solidify my knowledge for the large amount of time I've invested in reading non-fiction in past 4 years. It was humbling to stop and realize I had done a lot of hard work all for naught and need to revisit my thinking and opinion on notetaking actually incorporating my learning.
                - Was a game-changer read that caused me to adopt Roam.
            - "Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?"
                - I was only underlining and writing in books margins before, for really profound things I would capture the note or thought in Google Keep. I talked out my books takeaways to others, talking about the insight to a fellow person caused me to teach it and commit to memory - but typically nowhere near the content capability of a Zettelkasten system.
                - I implemented progressive summarization and a Zettelkasten system in Roam. I don't just underline text in a book and place it back on the shelf because I know i need to do the hard to work to actually implement the learnings and ideas provided by the book.
            - "Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?  "
                - Yes, needs work on structure to be able to easily connect old with new notes.
