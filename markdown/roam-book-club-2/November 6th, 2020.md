1. "Hi, from [[Casey Gollan]] in Brooklyn, NY! Two meetup ideas: "
    - "Perhaps a bit sacrilegious, but do any folks who are also [[Obsidian]] users want to do a [[Meetup]] to talk about workflows between multiple graphs? "
    - "I'd love to do a [[Meetup]] folks using Roam and Smart Notes within [[academia]]. LMK if you want to meet up about that!"
        - #Chat[[Joshua Gerald Butler]] I'd definitely be interested in it (although I am a student, rather than an actual academic, but definitely interested in moving into academia).
            - #Reply-from [[Casey Gollan]] #@ [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] Great! I don't think the boundaries need to be strict ‚Äîself-identifying is totally OK! I'm not an academic myself in terms of formal education, but I work in operations at a research institute, so would be interested in talking with academics about how folks are applying these tools and methods :)
        - #Reply-from [[Dan Allosso]] I‚Äôm a historian using Roam for my own work and planning to teach some of the Smart Notes ideas to students. I‚Äôd be interested in talking.
- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"When do you plan to read? Where? How often?"
{{[[POMO]]: 25}}
    1. [[Antonette Laderas]] I plan on reading after my daily morning quiet time, in my bed perhaps, daily. My ideal goal is to consume 15% of a book every single day to be able to read 1 book a week.
    2. [[Siva Arunagiri]] I plan on reading during my day in short intervals at work. I am just about 25% through the book. Using [[Readwise]] to transfer the [[Kindle-Highlights]] to my graph. 
    3. [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] As a student I'm always reading, but I'm planning on trying to schedule my reading a bit more during the day so i make sure that when i do the reading i have the energy to properly read it, take notes, and truly think about the ideas im taking in, rather than just moving my way through the book at a rapid pace and seeing what i gleam of it at the end. 
    4. [[Dan Allosso]] #alwaysreading but yeah, I should be more intentional about when I process the stuff I'm reading, listening to, watching. So far, it has been an evening activity once "work" reading and writing are done. I'm currently finishing a semester in which I'm teaching four classes, so prep and assessment keep me pretty busy. 
    5. [[Matthew Vogel]] I do my best intentional reading before noon. Reading for pleasure is usually best after 7 with a drink or some hot tea. I have been toying with the idea of trying to read more continuously throughout the day using the pomodoro method.
    6. [[Casey Gollan]] Fridays!
    7. [[Alex Shchedrin]] I do not have a planned time to read other than a few pages before going to sleep, majority of my reading this week happens ad hoc. I have mostly read the book before the Book club started, but now re-reading it from the graph while making fleeting notes on my page. The challenge is trying not to read all of the block references that are already there, because it slows me down significantly. 
        - Update. Ended up going on a long walk and allowing Alexa‚Äôs calming voice to narrate the book to me. 
        - Hint: If you have a Kindle version of the book you can use Amazon Alexa app to read it to you with Text to Speech.
3. #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"As we are the authors of all the notes, we learn in lockstep with the slip-box. This is another big difference from using an encyclopaedia like Wikipedia. We use the same mental models, theories and terms to organise our thoughts in our brains as in our slip-box. That the slip-box generates an excess of possibilities enables it to surprise and inspire us to generate new ideas and develop our theories further. It is not the slip-box or our brains alone, but the dynamic between them that makes working with it so productive."
    1. [[Beau Haan üìå]] #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[The mystery of what is behind the horizon, has to be taken in-step with commitment, but is dynamic by having that dialogue with a partner that can speak to you in your own words]] 
        - This is such a fascinating take on all of this, because it goes beyond the horizon and brings back, like the mysteries of the black hole, a myriad of possibilities.
        - That's what I desire, really, above all else. To seek out with all that I've got something that has not been discovered before.
        - It's just like when the director calls action, and as the film rolls, there in that moment is every spark of life being captured, but the difference is the in-the-fucking-moment responsiveness that describes mastery of the craft of acting
        - There's something here. There's something more than just writing fucking notes that draws me in. It's this dynamic, this relationship with my own words, that I strive for.
        - I can't put into words just exactly what it is, and that's the fucking hardest part about all of this, because we are so conditioned to having to "see-it, before we believe-it"
        - And I don't think I can change that view of the world, but to insist that I continue down this path, but without having to rely on willpower. It's got to be something more than that. The purpose behind it, I suppose?
        - I want to be surprised, I want to be taken on this journey with my notes, that fills the curiosity of my mind with insights that I just would not have been able to have without a structure that provides me with those keys to unlock doors, that reach farther and deeper to the abyss of the unknown-unknown.
        - What does it really mean to learn? Why is it that this process is so convoluted with so many outs, that prevent most from adopting such a simple, and practical idea.
        - I'm not sure... but I cling on to the hopes that what I'm learning and what I have experienced is only going to multiply into a vastness that far exceeds the work that it took to begin... and continue...
    2. [[Dan Allosso]] I like the idea that the Roam/Slipbox will be a document of my own, that I am the author of. This may be the most potent argument for me, actually, against the idea of importing content via Readwise or other tools. I use Readwise actually, but I still see that phase as consumption rather than production. IMO It becomes production when I paraphrase and comment on the idea.
        - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] I am having similar thoughts about [[Readwise]], [[Dan Allosso]]. I like how it collects highlights & comments from all my digital reading sources (mostly [[Kindle]] & [[Instapaper]]), and I enjoy getting the daily highlight reviews. But I'm not yet sure how to appropriately use it for the Slipbox. My comments from digital books and articles are usually extensive, but rough around the edges. In this way they are best characterized as [[Fleeting Notes]].  Do I automatically sync these fleeting notes to Roam for processing (someday), or do I manually process these notes into Roam just like I would for a paper based information source?  I am still figuring this out. What are some of your considerations?
            - #Reply-from [[Dan Allosso]] I‚Äôm not that concerned about my reactions to content coming from Readwise, Instapaper, Airr, and Walling (which I use for processing video) being rough around the edges, as long as it‚Äôs in my own words. I think Fleeting Notes are pretty casual and unstructured, so I don‚Äôt think I want to apply the types of structures to them that I‚Äôve seen in a lot of videos, where folks have set up elaborate Notion forms they fill out when they‚Äôve finished reading a book, for example. I‚Äôd like to capture my fleeting thoughts (often I swear at stupid stuff I hear on podcasts in a voice note). I trust the idea will get cleaned up if it turns out to be a ‚Äúkeeper‚Äù. But I‚Äôm guessing the key to this (which I‚Äôm just getting started with) is developing a routine where I review fleeting notes and either trash them or take them to the next step, quickly and regularly.

    - [[Dan Allosso]] This reminds me of several presentations I‚Äôve seen in the Annotation world (Iannotate, Hypothes.is) that are replete with images of illuminated and heavily-annotated texts from the ancient and early-modern world. 
6. **How are we notetaking in the information abundance age?** {{[[r/moved]]}}[*](**How are we notetaking in the information abundance age?** )
    - #Reply-from [[Siva Arunagiri]] I have recently found some amazing apps like [[Instapaper]], [[Readwise]] and have been using [[Kindle]] for quite a long time now. [[Evernote]] has been my top go-to app for a long time but reading about the better options in other apps have helped me build a system for better knowledge consumption and longevity. 
7. #Chat [[Siva Arunagiri]]: For all those new to [[zettelkasten]] system but have a huge treasure load of articles, highlights, captures in [[Evernote]] or any other apps of your choice, how are working on setting up a suitable system based [[zettelkasten]]? Mainly how are you planning on working with your previous loads of notes that you have in your archives? 
    - #Reply-from [[Dan Allosso]] I'm planning on leaving the pdfs I've copied into Evernote in that app, and the same with the more recent batch I've highlighted in MarginNote3. I'm putting videos in Walling and commenting on podcasts in Airr and audiobooks in the Audible app. They don't go into Roam in their original form, but as either fleeting notes or as reading notes -- in both cases in my own words rather than as block quotes. 
    - #Chat[[Joshua Gerald Butler]] Ohh good question, perhaps this is an  idea  that should be discussed in the second session?
    - #Reply-from [[Bruno d'Abreu]] I noticed that my biggest problems are friction to just write quickly and revisiting my notes. What worked for me, at least regarding my job, was keeping it very simple and analogue, with  a fountain pen and a pocket notebook ([Leuchtturm 1917](https://www.leuchtturm1917.com/), those are great!) and some inspiration from the [[Bullet Journal]]. Altough with this system I was able to keep up with my work, I would like to use Roam Research as a complimentary note-taking, to help me develop my thinking. 
8. #Question[[Joshua Gerald Butler]] How are people planning on transfering their knowledge and notes they have gained from this book group back to their own personal graphs?
    - #Reply[[Mike Kramer]]I was fortunate enough to participate in the first version of the [[Roam Book Club]], so I am basing my reply both on that experience and the concepts [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] outlines in the current book:
        - my goal is to create "chunks," or meaningfully interconnected aggregations of [[permanent notes]]. [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] does not use the word "chunk", but I find it quite helpful to think in those terms precisely because it, self-referentially, aggregates a lot of different claims made in the book. (For more on chunking see [[cognitive load]] theory or [[[[Barbara Oakley]] A Mind for Numbers]])
        - to achieve my goal, I need to:
            1. take literature notes __in my own words__
            2. make [[permanent notes]] if I think they are justified
            3. make higher-order notes that combine two or more [[permanent notes]], when I think that they are justified.
        - in the context of the book club I will manually transfer [[permanent notes]] and higher-order notes from this database to my personal database (connecting them to proper bibliographic information)
            I get the sense that many other book club participants would not look warmly upon the crude process of manual transfer. 
            I view it as an essential step, since one of the points of this book is that we must engage deeply with our notes to avoid the "mere-exposure" effect (75) whereby merely reading a note causes us to believe that we understand it.
        - when I first started doing this, I, too, felt frustrated by the fact that I had to do double work. I subsequently realized that I was looking at this entirely wrong. An effective spaced-repetition system requires, well, repetition. By deciding which items to transfer, as well as whether they needed to be revised, as well as whether they lent themselves to connection with other notes, I was putting larger, more durable chunks into my [[long-term memory]]. And that is exactly what distinguishes those with greater understanding and expertise from those with less.
            - #Chat[[Joshua Gerald Butler]] #Reply[[Mike Kramer]]
                - Thank you, this section in particular has changed the way i am going to think about it. Transfering the knowledge from here to my personal graph is not a chore, but a chance to further develop that knowledge that I will be transferring. 
            - (Here is a quick distillation of what I take to be, perhaps, the essential point of the book (sects. 9.5, 11.3):
                - [[Solomon Shereshevsky]], the man with the photographic memory, was at the opposite end of the spectrum from where we want to be, since he could not aggregate--or connect--his memory traces into meaningful chunks.
                - an expert, on the other hand, can aggregate a very large number of ideas in a single chunk.
                - a large chunk consumes as much [[working memory]] capacity as a small chunk.
                - the expert does not have more [[working memory]] capacity, rather, they have larger chunks in their field of expertise
                - so, we seek to expand our expertise by mastering larger, more connected, chunks that aggregate our [[permanent notes]]
                - the rest, we can discard.)
9. [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] **Simple ideas are only good ideas when put into practice efficiently, holds true with the concepts of this book.**
10. #Chat [[Beau Haan üìå]] I understand that this whole process may seem messy and confusing, but perhaps that's the point of it all? 
    - Imagine what our brains have to process at a second-by-second basis, and then it only makes sense, that the overflow from our minds, that spills onto the page, is analogous to that same struggle.
    - Yet, I can't think of a better time, or with a better group of community members to lean-on during this season of the learning cycle
    - It gets easier, it has to... but I know there's work to be done, and I'd like to think that I am taking that responsibility on willingly~
11. #Announcement If anyone is in need of an accountability partner, don't hesitate to reach out to me, and we can chat about the goals and then structure some way to hold one another to it! [*](((U4WwreZm_)))
    - #[[Reply-from]] [[Antonette Laderas]] Are you willing to mentor an engineering student, maybe as a guide in thesis writing? Struggling on this one. Fortunately, I'm just getting started on it.
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan]] I think that would be a wonderful experiment, and to have the progress of it all tracked in this `Daily Notes` page, so when people stumble upon this at a later time, they can follow the process... plus more people can add to the conversation!
            - I do want to emphasize that the best thing that I am able to offer is encouragement for you to find the solutions for yourself~
            - And that this book by [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] outlines a practical solution to the dreaded __blank page__ rather well
            - Maybe the first place to start would be, the question of: **What's the problem?**
                - #[[Reply-from]] [[Antonette Laderas]] Wow! Thanks a lot! This would be great. Maybe I can just ask you questions as I go along my undergrad research. Is that okay with you? I would be honored. Thanks again! Expect me to bug you from time to time haha.
                    #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] Of course! And be sure to practice `((Block referencing))` so people can follow the thread as they scour this archive, once we finish

12. #Announcement by [[Antonette Laderas]]
Noticed that the [[Introduction]] was missing one paragraph (second to the last paragraph) based from my digital copy of [[How to Take Smart Notes]]. Informing you guys that I added it already. Waah. Just started last night. Haha Here it is:
    - "It is not so important who you are, but what you do. Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, to success. At first glance, this is both good and bad news. The good news is that we wouldn't be able to do much about our IQ anyway, while it seems to be within our control to have more self-discipline with a little bit of willpower. The bad news is that we do not have this kind of control over ourselves. Self-discipline or self-control is no that easy to achieve with willpower alone. Willpower is, as far as we know today, a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term (Baumester, Bratslavsky, 1998; Schmeichel, Vohs, and Boumeister, 2003; Moller, 2006). And who would want to flog oneself to work, anyway?"
13. #Poll Are you struggling with the concept of #[[Fleeting Notes]]? 
{{[[slider]]}}
(Move the slider, and your avatar will tally a score, 0=No, 10=Yes)
    - [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]] I'm starting to see the value of fleeting notes. My reading of HTTSM has been slowed down because I've gone deep into re-framing what I've read or exploring new ideas that arise. By taking fleeting notes, I capture the essence without losing as much reading flow.
14. #Question    Is it possible for   [[Roam Research]] to have a listening feature? It's great to read with audio.
    - And while we're at it, an audio recording feature. Then I could completely leave Evernote behind. But I know these things take time...
15. [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]] #Practice  When I encounter examples of #[[Mental model]]s in my daily life and thinking, I'll describe them in my own words and add them as a linked reference to the note on the specific model.
16. #Question "Should I strive to include the 5w1h of journalism (Who, What, When, Where, Why and How) in each zettel in the Roam?"
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] This is so interesting, because I had began doing that exact process of creating that sort of orienting question algorithm of thought
        - Then I realized that the power of [[Roam]] gives me the flexibility to do that with the proper nesting technique. Underneath my main summarized thought, I could add all of the `Process::` notes and be done with them, by collapsing the bullet points that are extraneous. 
        - Again, this presupposes that the questioning of __who, what, when, where, why and how__ is a way to triangulate a sort of GPS positioning of my thoughts
            - My solution has been to apply that contextually with the usage of the fundamental aspects of [[Roam]]'s technological advancements including:
                1. `#tags`
                2. `[[Pages]]`
                3. `((Block references))`
                4. Time = `Daily Notes` page
            - With "Time = `Daily Notes` page" being the most important
    - "Example 1: In his 2017 book, [[How to Take Smart Notes]], Sonke Ahrens describes a note-taking system to foster your ability to reflect, think and produce writing. The method is based on [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s [[Zettelkasten]]. It works through notes that distill a single idea, written in a simple, concise form, with your own words. As you write this note, you should reflect on related ideas in other notes and make reference to that. In this senses you create a network of ideas, with a structure constructed from bottom up. In this way, you create a dialog with the system, that will surface new ideas and possibilities. It will also facilitate your writing, as the notes can be easily arranged as a framework of a text. #zettel"
    - "Furthermore, I am also not sure how to deal with dependency on other notes. I know that each note should be self-evident and be comprehensible outside it's links, but how much so?"

    - #Reply [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]]
        - You could also see if one good question arises. S√∂nke talks about this in chapter 13.1:
            - "Good questions are in the sweet spot of being relevant and interesting, not too easy to answer but possible to tackle with material that is available or at least within our reach. When it comes to finding good questions, it is therefore not enough to think about it. We have to do something with an idea before we know enough about it to make a good judgement. We have to work, write, connect, differentiate, complement and elaborate on questions‚Äìbut this is what we do when we take smart notes."
17. #Question [[Casey Gollan]] 
    - Is anyone else reading the paper book and REALLY struggling just to convert all your book highlights into Roam blocks? Pulling in block references from the shared graph is both easier (because I don't have to transcribe from scratch) and more exciting(because I sometimes find unexpected connections, or come back to find someone else has left me a note!) than working in a solo graph. But it still feels so labor intensive and not like the best use of time.    
18. [[Jason Griffing]]"I'm currently reading [[Essays and Aphorisms]] by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. There's an essay titled "On Thinking for Yourself" where he says the following: 

__" As the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one, so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value to you than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself; because only through ordering what you know by comparing every truth with every other truth can you take complete possession of your knowledge."__ #Quotes

This was written in the 1850s. Schopenhauer was also German. Pure speculation, but¬† I can't help but wonder if [[Niklas Luhmann]] was influenced by this."
    - [[Questions for S√∂nke]] - Is there any evidence that [[Niklas Luhmann]] was influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]?
