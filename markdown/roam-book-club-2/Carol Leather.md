- [[Goals for Book Club]]
    - I have been using Roam for a couple of months, but I would like to make better use of it to create articles for my sites. 
    - I am interested in learning how to collate information to use for this, and how to structure and process those notes using the [[zettelkasten]] methods. 
    - I wish to read and put into practice the techniques shared in [[Sönke Ahrens]] book to help me produce more content in less time, and stop procrastinating when it comes to the actual writing steps.
    - I understand that it takes time to learn new techniques and put them into practice.
    - Learning this alongside others seems like an ideal opportunity to learn together.
