                - [[Mike Kramer]]'s thoughts on promoting literature notes to permanent notes: 
                    - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]] I very much wish to avoid hair-splitting, scholastic discussions of terminology. Having said that, I now wish to explain the terminological distinctions that I make, based on my best understanding of how to implement an Ahrens-like Zettelkasten in Roam. [*](((-AlmBAw5W)))
                        - I always make a permanent note a page.  I do this because my goal is to create a denser network of meaningful links and Roam is tuned for links among pages, not blocks.
                            - I never make a literature note a page. I always make it as block in the page named by the book's title.
                        - It wouldn't matter to me if you were to promote your literature note to a permanent note or copy it to make a new note. 
                        - It is probably the case that most permanent notes will be the ideas of others, since the idea is that most good ideas are new combinations of pre-existing elemental ideas.
                        - If I thought I wanted to remember what the [[Tunnel Effect]] was (someone else has already created this tag), I would create a tag and would probably write the note something like this: "habit change is more difficult in times of stress because of the [[Tunnel Effect]]."

        - But the reason why Watson and Crick or Kekulé had these insights and not a random person on the street is that they already had spent a very long time thinking hard about the problems, tinkered with other possible solutions and tried countless other ways of looking at the problem. Our fascination with these stories clouds the fact that all good ideas need time. Even sudden breakthroughs are usually preceded by a long, intense process of preparation. [*](((8OsaRd7c8)))
        - Being experienced with a problem and intimately familiar with the tools and devices we work with, ideally to the point of virtuosity, is the precondition for discovering their inherent possibilities. 
It is the intuition that comes from the intimate knowledge of a practice that can lead us to new insights. But intuition is not the opposition to rationality and knowledge, it is rather the incorporated, practical side of our intellectual endeavours, the sedimented experience on which we build our conscious, explicit knowledge.

    - #[[Literature Notes]]You're truly open-minded if you acknowledge that you have blindspots, that your information is incomplete and that your thinking is subject to bias. If you think you're open-minded, then it's a sign that you probably are not. 
        - To be able to see what we see instead of what we expect to see is indeed a skill in itself, not like a character trait of being “open-minded.” Those who think of themselves as being open-minded are often even more prone to stick to their first understanding as they believe to be without natural prejudices and therefore don’t see the need to counterbalance them. If we think we can “hold back” an interpretation, we are fooling ourselves. [12.6 Think Inside the Box:](((V7d2nhO5m)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] We immediately read on the level of meaningful understanding. 
        - The same is true when we read: We don’t see lines on a paper first, then realize that these are words, then use them to build sentences and finally decipher the meaning. 
            - To really understand a text is therefore a constant revision of our first interpretation. We have to train ourselves to get used to seeing this difference and to hold back our ingrained urge to jump to conclusions.

        - Steps to avoid biased thinking:
            - Ask questions.
                - Is it true? Is there evidence to disprove this? What am I actually seeing here? What thinking am I adding to this perception.
            - Notice when you form opinions and add, "but maybe I'm wrong."

- #Zettels [[Recording and then reviewing a performance is the way to improve any skill]]
    - #[[Literature Notes]] We need an external system in order to retrieve information think rationally. Otherwise, we'll be led astray by our cognitive biases and the inaccuracy of memory.
        - As we write notes with an eye towards existing notes, we take more into account than the information that is already available in our internal memory. That is extremely important, because the internal memory retrieves information not in a rational or logical way, but according to psycho-logical rules. The brain also doesn’t store information neurally and objectively. We reinvent and rewrite our memory every time we try to retrieve information. The brain works with rules of thumb and makes things look as if they fit, even if they don’t. It remembers events that never happened, connects unrelated episodes to convincing narratives and completes incomplete images. It cannot help but see patterns and meaning everywhere, even in the most random things (cf. Byrne, 2008). The brain, as Kahneman writes, is “a machine for jumping to conclusions” (Kahneman, 2013, 79). And a machine that is designed for jumping to conclusions is not the kind of machine you want to rely on when it comes to facts and rationality–at least, you would want to counterbalance it. Luhmann states as clearly as possible: it is not possible to think systematically without writing (Luhmann 1992, 53). Most people still think about thinking as a purely internal process, and believe that the only function of the pen is to put finished thoughts on paper. Richard Feynman once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted to interview him. When he spotted Feynman’s notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such “wonderful records of Feynman’s thinking.” [11.2 Think Outside the Brain](((BernhIBab)))

    - #[[Literature Notes]]The slip-box is a tool to test your ideas before launching into a longer project.
        - If we, on the other hand, let questions arise from the slip-box, we know that they are tried and tested among dozens or even hundreds of other possible questions. The vast majority of questions might have been answered quickly or disappeared as no notes were drawn to them, either because of a lack of interest or a lack of material. This is how evolution works: by trial and error, not planning. [13.1 From Brainstorming to Slip - box - Storming:](((30eozOwaL)))

If the answer is yes, then a followup question is, "How could it be improved?" and "What is the core thing that is truly good about this idea? How can I focus on the 20% which is truly valuable?"
        - Fleeting notes are like song demos. Finished recordings are like zettels. They can stand alone. When making an album, you have to pare away songs that don't fit in the whole. But those songs are not wasted. They can be released in other ways, either as singles or part of other albums.

        - What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. More notes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring related ones together in a playful way. But it should be just the opposite: The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones–and the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort. [Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount](((wIYnbucZC)))
        - The biggest advantage compared to a top-down storage system organised by topics is that the slip-box becomes more and more valuable the more it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing. If you sort by topic, you are faced with the dilemma of either adding more and more notes to one topic, which makes them increasingly hard to find, or adding more and more topics and subtopics to it, which only shifts the mess to another level. The first system is designed to find things you deliberately search for, putting all the responsibility on your brain. The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. [Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount](((wIYnbucZC)))

    - #[[Literature Notes]] It's easier to start work toward a project if we begin with a small achievable goal then vague, larger project.
        - It is much easier to get started if the next step is as feasible as “writing a note,” “collect what is interesting in this paper” or “turning this series of notes into a paragraph” than if we decide to spend the next days with a vague and ill-defined task like “keep working on that overdue paper.” [13.5 Becoming an Expert by Giving up Planning](((bNiPQ4-rD)))
        - Slavoj Žižek said in an interview[ 41] that he wouldn’t be able to write a single sentence if he didn’t start by convincing himself he was only writing down some ideas for himself, and that maybe he could turn it into something publishable later. By the time he stopped writing, he was always surprised to find that the only thing left to do was revise the draft he already had. [13.6 The Actual Writing](((0907r7J3B)))
    - #[[Literature Notes]] Plan on doing well-defined, achievable tasks. Small steps, small wins. 
        - But the biggest difference lies in the task you are facing to start with.

- #Zettels [[We can't rely on memory to overcome cognitive bias; we need a system]]
    - #[[Literature Notes]] You can avoid falling into [[confirmation bias]] by gathering ideas __before__ you develop an argument.
        - Confirmation bias is tackled here in two steps: First, by turning the whole writing process on its head, and secondly, by changing the incentives from finding confirming facts to an indiscriminate gathering of any relevant information regardless of what argument it will support. [10.2 Keep an Open Mind](((x1W4xVIOs)))
    - #[[Literature Notes]] Seek out sources that challenge your argument. In this way you overcome unconscious [[confirmation bias]]. Charles Darwin did intentionally sought out disconfirming evidence.
        - The very moment we decide on a hypothesis, our brains automatically go into search mode, scanning our surroundings for supporting data, which is neither a good way to learn nor research. Worse, we are usually not even aware of this confirmation bias (or myside bias[ 28]) that surreptitiously meddles with our life. Somehow, we just seem to happen to be surrounded by people who all think alike. (Not on purpose, of course. We just spend our time with people we like. And why do we like them? Correct: Because they think like us.) We just seem to happen to read the publications that tend to confirm what we already know. (Not on purpose, of course. We just try to stick with good, intelligent texts. And what makes us think these texts are good and intelligent? Correct: because they make sense to us.) We look around and just cut out dis-confirming facts without even noticing what we don’t see, very much like the same city can one day be full of happy people and the other day full of miserable ones, depending on our mood. [10.2 Keep an Open Mind](((x1W4xVIOs)))
        - Even the best scientists and thinkers are not free from it. What sets them apart is the mere fact that they are aware of the problem and do something about it. The classic role model would be Charles Darwin. He forced himself to write down (and therefore elaborate on) the arguments that were the most critical of his theories. “I had [...] during many years followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favorable ones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were raised against my views, which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer.” (Darwin 1958, 123) [Chapter 14. Make it a Habit](((qc64s9vJP)))
    - #[[Literature Notes]] Be realistic about how hard it is to change a habit.
        - We have the best chance to change our behaviour over the long term if we start with a realistic idea about the difficulties of behavioural change (Dean 2013). And that is not so easy, because the more we are used to doing something in a particular way, the more in control we feel about it, even though we are less in control of it. (This is in part also due to the aforementioned mere-exposure error.) [Chapter 14. Make it a Habit](((x5hx3y9ay)))

                        - [[Mike Kramer]]'s thoughts on promoting literature notes to permanent notes: 
                            - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]] I very much wish to avoid hair-splitting, scholastic discussions of terminology. Having said that, I now wish to explain the terminological distinctions that I make, based on my best understanding of how to implement an Ahrens-like Zettelkasten in Roam. [*](((-AlmBAw5W)))
                                - I always make a permanent note a page.  I do this because my goal is to create a denser network of meaningful links and Roam is tuned for links among pages, not blocks.
                                    - I never make a literature note a page. I always make it as block in the page named by the book's title.
                                - It wouldn't matter to me if you were to promote your literature note to a permanent note or copy it to make a new note. 
                                - It is probably the case that most permanent notes will be the ideas of others, since the idea is that most good ideas are new combinations of pre-existing elemental ideas.
                                - If I thought I wanted to remember what the [[Tunnel Effect]] was (someone else has already created this tag), I would create a tag and would probably write the note something like this: "habit change is more difficult in times of stress because of the [[Tunnel Effect]]."

- #Zettels [[Forgetting information is a feature, not a bug]]
    - #[[Literature Notes]] The ability to forget and filter out information is necessary for abstract thinking. The slip-box remembers what we've learned so we can focus on thinking, connecting and creating.
        - Transferring ideas into the external memory also allows us to forget them. And even though it sounds paradoxical, forgetting actually facilitates long-term learning. [11.3 Learn by not trying](((v4uTJLRFT)))
        -  It wasn’t just that Shereshevsky was able to remember so much, he had trouble forgetting anything. The important things got lost under a pile of irrelevant details that involuntarily came to his mind. Although he was very good at remembering facts, Shereshevsky was almost incapable of getting the gist of something, the concepts behind the particulars and distinguishing the relevant facts from minor details. He had great trouble relating to literature or poetry. It should be obvious that for academic thinking and writing, the gift of being able to remember everything is a serious liability. [11.3 Learn by not trying](((v4uTJLRFT)))
        - “Selection is the very keel on which our mental ship is built. And in this case of memory its utility is obvious. If we remembered everything, we should on most occasions be as ill off as if we remembered nothing. It would take as long for us to recall a space of time as it took the original time to elapse, and we should never get ahead with our thinking.” (William James 1890, 680).

- #Zettels [[People are reluctant to adopt new technology if they don't see and understand how it could work in a larger eco-system (like a business or personal life)]]
    - #[[Literature Notes]] Malcolm McLean, inventor of the shipping container, didn't just focus on one part of the chain (the ship). His insight was to see how the delivery eco-system would be improved.
        - Only after aligning every single part of the delivery chain, from packaging to delivery, from the design of the ships to the design of the harbours, was the full potential of the container unleashed. [Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount](((9eRcB8Tey)))
    - #[[Literature Notes]] The slip-box leads to unexpected connections and insight.
        - It was, for example, a note on “technology, acceptance problems” that pointed out to me that an answer to the question why some people struggle to implement the slip-box could be found in a book on the history of the shipping container. [Afterword](((AEToJgvmY)))
- #Zettels [[The use of new technology leads to new ways of thinking]]
    - #[[Literature Notes]] Older learning approaches don't work with the slip-box. Students need to understand the basic process and change their workflow habits in order to benefit from using the Zettlekasten system.
        - The prevalence of linear and learner-centred approaches also lead to the common misunderstanding about the use of the slip-box as a tool that can be used without changing the work routines around it. It is then often used simply as an archive where you just take out what you put in earlier. This, of course, will lead to disappointment. If we are just storing information, there would be no need to use a slip-box. **To reap its benefits, we need to change our working routines.** And the basis for that is a deep understanding on how and why it works and how the different steps and tasks of writing fit together. This is why a book, not just a manual, is needed to explain the principle and ideas behind it. [Afterword](((AEToJgvmY)))
    - #[[Literature Notes]] Learning is not about storing information, but about learning new ways to think. In the process, we learn to question our thinking and let go of our idea of who we are.
        - The slip-box does not put the learner in the centre. Quite the contrary: It allows the learner to let his or her own thinking become decentralised within a network of other ideas. Learning, thinking and writing should not be about accumulating knowledge, but about becoming a different person with a different way of thinking. This is done by questioning one’s own thinking routines in the light of new experiences and facts. [Afterword](((AEToJgvmY)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
        - Using the slip box means that you actually have to change the way you work.
        - You have to change how you think as well.

            - Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else. When you are in a conversation, listening to a lecture, hear something noteworthy or an idea pops into your mind while you are running errands, a quick (fleeting) note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of doing. That might even apply to reading, if you want to focus on a text without interrupting your reading flow. Then you might want to just underline sentences or write short comments in the margins. It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text.

Finally, writing is a way to improve your thinking. 
        - It will change the way you read as well: You will become more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannot write down everything. You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don’t understand what it is about. By doing this, you will elaborate on the meaning, which will make it much more likely that you will remember it. You also have to think beyond the things you read, because you need to turn it into something new. And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf.
