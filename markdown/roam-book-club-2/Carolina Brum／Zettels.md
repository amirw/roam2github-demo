        - #[[Literature Notes]] [Chapter 8 Let the work carry you forward (paragraph 1)](((RK0T2uHBh)))
            - Relation work and energy: can be draining or energizing: one can either have to give more energy into it or getting energy from the work itself. Author says second is preferred.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Energy applied to a task, a reading, a conversation works like movement inertial, and can even bring more energy as a result. Defining priorities and value makes things more efficient in terms of energy.
            - The more you put energy in something, the more energy you get back
                - My idea, not sure if that's what the author means
                - It means that to get to deeper levels of knowledge
                    - You have to devote energy
                        - Things present themselves
                            - If you're present, the other person gives back to you
                        - There's an exchange between you and the information
                            - The more focus I have, the more I get from that book
            - Phenomena of inertia
                - In relation to inertia like a car moving, it consumes power to keep moving
                    - More like walking
                        - It takes more energy to brake and stop, than to keep going
                        - I already something that bringing me forward
                            - A body tends to be in this state
                                - It's like the same thing here
                - Once you get into the workflow, you gain momentum
            - Being effective in working
                - It's easy to be caught in details
                    - Going over to-do lists
                        - And not checking the priority
                            - Too linear in execution is not super effecient
            - Focusing on what is important
                - What is the essential thing?
                    - What is the minimum thing?
                        - Just to move forward
                            - Just to know the terms
                                - I need to know the terminology first
                - Prioritizing in more gross value
                    - How much they contribute
            - I like the fact that he talks about releasing energy
                - When you discovering things
                    - Aha moments, give you energy
                        - Once you have an idea, that goes beyond that's written there, it's bonus
                            - An additional thinig
                                - That thing inspires something that came out of you
                - You get the energy back
                    - I'm coming back to this one

    - the idea of saving thoughts for later consideration helps me keep on track with planning

        - #[[Literature Notes]] In order to make note taking more effective, the written notes should not be an end product, but rather a living thought that relates to others by a simple structure that can be potentially learned and tuned for one's needs.
            - Thoughts may die or be dead if stored as final products
            - Shifting take noting as process requires to learn a few techniques and rules that will give structure for the process to happen.
            - Another relevant part of the process is to tune the process to your own needs
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Note-taking is more effective as insight generator or memory aid if used as a process and not as a final outcome.
            - note-taking should be seen as a process and not as an outcome
                - as an outcome, it hardly relates to other relevant information and it probably dies
                - by not doing relational thoughts, many ideas can come to waste, as we have limited cognition and memory in a time spam

        - #[[Literature Notes]] [Chapter 1, on structure](((e6S9ctjL0)))
            - A structure should be so that you can trust, that enables flow, and should provide some flexibility
            - Author claims that a good structure allows us to **do the right thing at the right time**.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A good structure enables flow. Once it is trusted by the user, habit should require some initial effort. The good structure should also provide some level of flexibility, allowing for saving some thoughts for later, reducing multitasking, without losing the focus on the main picture.
            - a good structure allows for focusing without losing sight of the bigger picture
                - a good structure should be trustworthy

                - it should be flexible enough to allow for changing context, avoid multitasking, focusing and saving information for later
            - allowing oneself to have spread out thoughts but save them for later, assessed by the technological feature of adding tags for **todo** or **need references** is a good solution to give the right amount of attention to a side thought one doesn't want to miss
            - brain has limited capability (cognitive and memory) to keep all thoughts for further annotation
                - annotation as you go may allow for exponential increase of information and more complex connections
                    - this may be particularly helpful for me as I have trouble devoting attention to things I've already figured out, the cognitive load needs to remain complex to gain my effort

            - Luhmann’s only real help was a housekeeper who cooked for him and his children during the week, not that extraordinary considering he had to raise three children on his own after his wife died early.

        - structure should be flexible enough to keep the options open to insight-oriented writing

        - the feeling of staying in control of the writing process can be achieved by **keeping the options open**
