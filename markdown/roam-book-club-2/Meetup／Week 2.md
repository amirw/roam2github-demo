        - [[Beau Haan 📌]]
            - I would describe this way of note-taking as a way to really have an artifact of who I am, and the thoughts that I have on daily basis. It's a way to really get into the core of who I am
            - This way of note taking is powerful because of the integration of how it takes who we are and interleaves it with what we are learning
            - The spaced repetition of things is also powerful because of the way I am continually going back to what I've written, and as this system develops
            - It's a way to really create this idea-generating machine and to make it into something that really curates my thoughts in ways that I really have been hoping for, but just haven't found a way to do
            - There's a sense of yearning to want to know this system, and so many people are saying that this is the way, but they forget that because this is personalized, there's something that has to happen on the inside to make this system be effective
            - And the whole system seems different than other tools because of what it supposedly offers, but to have people see that is difficult without really applying the most fundamental aspects of this, which is the personalization over time
            - The fears of note-taking in this way is crucial, because this is inherently owning the words that I'm saying, and that's scary... I mean think about... it's scary to even just speak openly on a zoom call
        - [[ed marsh]]
            - "How would you describe this system of note-taking?"
                - I would describe [[Zettelkasten]] as a knowledge codification system that organically categorizes observations to allow undiscovered hypotheses to float to the top. The principle is clear - I'm kind of hung up on some of the details like differentiation of note types. Interestingly I've done a lot of work in Germany and with German companies and it's an interesting contrast to that which has been much more driven by thesis than by broad discovery.
            - "What makes a zettelkasten so powerful?"
                - we all have many interests, and consume lots of information - across disciplines. I'm not using it for academic research, but rather personal goal management, client engagement, knowledge management, R&D concepts. I have the sense that part of what makes it powerful is that it's possible to accommodate all of it in the hyperkinetic world, chaotic workflow we all face. Maybe a way to synthesize flow when circumstances so collude against it.
                - I've had lots of notes over the years from Kindle, in margins, highlights, pages torn from magazines, links, pocket articles, etc. and most of it is lost. Like [[swipefile]] which so quickly become overwhelming
                - my biggest concern is interrupting the flow of reading or thinking to write
                - i still feel like in [[Roam]] (not sure it's a [[Zettelkasten]] issue) is that I know I'm collecting it, but it's not efficiently codified into usable content that will bubble up the ideas or refresh me on topic
        - [[Brandon Toner]]
            - "How would you describe this system of note-taking?"
                - Zettelkasten translates to "slip-box" — which is inspired by the system used by [[Niklas Luhmann]] where he would add notes on index cards and connect them to other related notes.
                - A zettelkasten is a method of note-taking that allows you to gradually build ideas from atomic units.
                - [[fleeting notes]] are captured while reading material or as random thoughts.
                - [[reference notes]] capture the context of the note. The source and highlights.
                - [[literature notes]] are summaries of the author's main points.
                - [[permanent notes]] are synthesized notes made by combining all of the notes in your zettelkasten. Mainly from [[literature notes.]]
                - This process is similar to [[Andy Matuschak]]'s [[Evergreen Notes]] concept. 
                - The key is making notes that are [[atomic]] in nature. So they can be combined easily with each other.
                - When an [[idea]] hits (a project, article, etc), you can easily look through your [[zettelkasten]] to build an outline and being filling it in.
                - The goal is to make [[creating]] and [[publishing]] easy.
            - "What makes a zettelkasten so powerful?"
                - By making notes that are atomic, and written in your own words, you can put them together like [[Lego]] blocks! 
                - The [[zettelkasten]] is an inspiring place to explore. There are many opportunities to have new ideas or new presentation of old ideas.
                    - While making notes
                    - While reviewing literature notes
                    - While reviewing permanent notes
                    - While exploring note to note, making new connections.
            - [[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]]
                - How to describe it to your mom? a 5-year old?
                - Zettlekasten is a way to write effortlessly.
                - Zettlekasten is a way to understand what you're thinking about.
                - A way to have a conversation with your thoughts.
                - Zettlekasten is a way to take a perspective of non-duality. 
                    - Ideas arise. I didn't make them out of thin air. Though with the Zettlekasten, it __feels__ like they come from thin air.
                    - ZettleKasten allows us to see thoughts arise.
                    - At the risk of sounding like a hippie, it's a form of meditation.
                - The more you do it, the more connections you start to make. Gets easier over time.
                - Already helping my memory.
                - Past: frustrated with reading; forgetting information

                - Mary uses a system of seedling and evergreen notes.
                    - Roughly 10x more seedlings than evergreens.
                - Use spaced repetition to have ideas re-surface.
                - So and so argues x, which relates to y...
                - Contradictory arguments > add to permanent note template
            - [[ed marsh]]
                - make it easily codified

                - self directed learning
                - roam and zettelkasten are interconnected

                - still need to rely on some [[mapping]] that is beyond the capabilities of [[Roam]]
                - skips the [[fleeting notes]] and goes right to [[literature notes]]

                - goal to reduce noise. Right now, I throttle my tag use because it starts to look yucky (too distracting). I’d like to be able to hide only the # page links, to improve readability. That would allow me to tag more liberally
                - ↑ ideal to toggle quickly with a keystroke. Yea, trying to find ways to maximize signal:noise
        - [[Adam Bartley]]
            - "How would you describe this system of note-taking?"
            - I envision this way of notetaking as a way of externalizing knowledge that we accumulate along the way with our studies. Over time, a Zettelkasten makes incremental gains in our understanding of a topic, as we further specify the questions and concepts we explore with it.  
            - "What makes a zettelkasten so powerful?"
            - A zettelkasten is an incredibly powerful tool in the way that it serves us reminders of our past trains of thought. Realizing that our novel insights, may not be as novel as they look... and that if we keep bumping into these serendipitous ideas, we may as well pursue them. I love the idea of instead of doing a traditional brainstorming session thinking top-down for exploring a concept, we should instead be building from a bottom-up approach. 
        - [[Mary Chipman]]
            - For me the concept of the zettelkasten is a potential solution to a problem that I have been ruminating on for the last 15 years, to wit: how to break down the artificial barriers represented by information contained in different content silos as exemplified in wikis and hierarchical structures that have no connection to equally important content in other wikis, all of which is necessary to come up with a complete and valid solution or answer to a question. Databases, whether they are Excel, SQL Server or Roam, exist to answer questions, and all have a semantic structure that needs to be understood in order to get the most out of them. My perspective is that of a database developer -- how do you ask the right question, and what kind of a structure best facilitates getting an accurate answer? As a programmer-writer at Microsoft I was obsessed with how content was sealed off in different repositories, each of which was narrowly focused on only one aspect. It was a blind-man-and-the-elephant problem where focus was narrow and cross-product documentation impossible to find. One has to piece together the elephant piece by piece, which is incredibly frustrating.
        - [[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]]
            - Zettlekasten is atomic note-taking.
            - A note-taking method that allows me to write effortlessly. 
            - It's a way to have a conversation with your knowledge.
            - Zettlekasten allows for more writing flow.
            - But why do we write?
                - We write to understand what we're learning and thinking. We learn to reflect ourselves.
                - The Zettlekasten listens. Then it speaks our ideas back to us. We hear the ideas in a different way when we read them on the page. It's a way to test our ideas and understanding.
            - Idea generation
                - I'd like to approach this a non-dualistic way. 
                - Let ideas arise. See that I'm not ultimately in control. I'm more watching the ideas arise. 
                - The idea might be a reformulation of what I'm reading.
                - Or it might be a new connection to something else I've been thinking about.
                - Or it might be a "totally new idea" (scare quotes used because there are no "totally new ideas").
            - I'm not so insecure about writing, but perhaps a little insecure about may ability to learn the technique.
            - Code-switching questions
                - How would you explain this to a five-year old?

    - Is the fleeting note necessary?
    - But with tools like the slip-box, we sometimes forget that the handling is as important as the possibilities of the tool itself. If we try to use a tool without putting any thought into the way we work with it, even the best tool would not be of much help. The slip-box, for example, would most likely be used as an archive for notes–or worse: a graveyard for thoughts (cf. Hollier 2005, 40 on Mallarmé’s index cards). Unfortunately, there are quite a few explanations of Luhmann’s technique on the Internet that focus in a misleading way on the technicalities of the slip-box. This has led to plenty of misconceptions about its abilities. But things are changing: Luhmann’s slip-box is currently the object of a long-term research project at the University of Bielefeld, and their first results have already given us a comprehensive understanding about how Luhmann really worked with it. You can look up for yourself some of his notes on their website.[ 12] Soon, you will be able to access the whole digitalised slip-box online. Add to this understanding recent psychological insights about learning, creativity and thinking, and we also get a pretty good picture why it works. ^^And it is indeed crucially important not only to know how it works or how to work with it, but also why it works. Only then will you be able to tweak it for your own needs.^^ And this is what this book is for: To give you all the resources you need to work in the best possible way with the best technique available. By keeping just a few basic principles in mind and with an understanding of the logic behind the file system, I see no reason why anyone should not be able to replicate Luhmann’s formula for successful learning, writing and research.

            - Learn the system, then personalize.
    - With anything, you need to use it before it can be personalized
    - We really need to understand the process to use it well
    - It applies to other things
    - Learn the system, then tweak it,

                - The strategies are inadequate and the business fails or impaired
            - p60 OBECALP (placebo backwards) - a dose to overcome self doubts and build self confidence "Imagine, for a moment, that all your self-doubts are simply a function of society's immune system, designed to extinguish noncomforming actions."

        - chapter - "Accomodate [[free radicals]]" is really interesting - pps 137-139. here's [Belsky's article](https://99u.adobe.com/articles/7098/a-manifesto-for-free-radicals-less-paperwork-less-waiting-more-action) from the Adobe website
        - importance of office space to create a collaberative and creative environment. I would love to work on the design of an office space for a team. that would be fun and meaningful, and to have the right art and other features.
        - interesting idea of a "done wall" to recognize accomplishments and success - not just the list of things that have to still get done #management
        - #delegation - people have to be able to clearly answer what their tasks/job are, but importantly in the context of the company vision
        - questions to ask to elicit better #delegation results
            - how did it go on a scale of 1-10
            - what should we have done differently
            - what worked suprisingly well
    - 
- #[[Fleeting Notes]] It's a bit like the GTD concept of having a single inbox for collecting all your to-dos. It'd be better to have a system that works in the same way no matter what you are reading or taking notes on.

            - 1st Question::
                - Core concepts of [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam]] {{[[POMO]]: 10}}
                - What are the core concepts of [[Zettelkasten]]?
                - I think there's much to be said about what this is, and there's so many people that want to figure this out, but there seems to be this gap, that everyone is struggling to understand 
                    - Fundamentally, I think there is something to be said about the personalized aspect of what this all is
                    - How else can this be functional, how else can it be worthwhile, if there isn't a part of me invested in the making of this [[Zettelkasten]]
                - When I think of how this relates to [[Roam]] I think about
                - The expectation that everyone has of just getting to the finish line is detrimental to actually achieving the goal of having setup something that will remain intact, and unbreakable no matter how much I change
                - There's something to be said about the hardships that I've encountered and I have to be realistic that all of this is going to be worthwhile
                - The teaching aspect isn't lost on me either though, because I see that just like any other skill that I have mastered in my life, there is something to be said 
                - 
                    - I posted it below
                - Core concepts:
                    - Personalized 
                    - Habitualized
                    - Idea-generating machine
                    - Dialogue
                - And to explain this to someone just starting, I think the most important thing I would say, would be this... just trust in the system, because the system works

        2. [[Michael Antoniou]]
            - Core concepts of [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam]]
                I currently have the Zettelkasten as follows in my head:
                    - I think about something in my daily life and make a fleeting note about it to elaborate later.
                    - I consume information through books, articles, podcasts etc. A difference from the original Zettelkasten is i want to have my highlights from these sources saved in raw form i.e Reference notes.
                    - My reference notes will lead to literature notes which is an enrinchment of a raw information piece with my own thoughts. A big debate i have here is whether a Reference note should lead to one Roam page with multiple literature notes or multiple pages i.e more atomic literature notes. 
                    - These multiple literature notes should then combine into a more abstract concept or idea. I think for now i am missing this step. I think i am mostly connecting interesting ideas from various sources as permanent notes whereas i should add a step where i first abstract concepts and then connect them together.
                Main Roam related questions:
                    - When do i create a separate page? Like the literature note above. 1 page with multiple literature notes or multiple pages
                    - Structure of each page - i am currently not clear on the benefit of having for example a block called "related notes" vs throwing related notes in the text like Andy Matuschak.
        3. [[Nikki Huang]]
            - reading with a purpose in mind
            - summarising information soon after you've read information and taken fleeting notes, ideally on the same day
            - organising notes according to context in which you think you will encounter them rather than topic
                - but what if you can't think of any contexts right now?
            - Step4: Building up to [[Permanent Notes]] - nest everything else under again
                - Step3: [[Literature Notes]] Come back and selectively write down the main points you want to remember in your own words. Nest the Fleeting Note and Quote block reference underneath
                    - Source:: [*Source](((ItfRjGKav))) - You can insert your source from Step 2 up here now and put Source as an attribute
                    - Step1: [[Fleeting Notes]] This is a thought that I had while reading 
                        - Step2: I can block reference "Check out [Roam Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=10&v=YcNW-eidDJk&feature=emb_logo)" the section of the text that led me to have that thought
                            - I can even replace the block reference with an alias: [*test alias](((ItfRjGKav)))

            - Core concepts of [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam]] {{[[POMO]]: 10}}
                Being intentional in what you put your second brain into.
                I setup my Zettels or [[Personal Knowledge Management]] in [[Roam Research]] with [[Consumption Vault]], [[Knowledge Vault]], and [[Wisdom Vault]].
                    - [[Consumption Vault]] summarizes and synthesizes the information or notes I accumulated from what I consumed from different resources like books, videos, courses, podcasts, articles, etc. They are further divided into `#Ongoing`, `#Processing`, '`#Waiting`, `#Shared`.
                    - [[Knowledge Vault]] is my main [[Slipbox]] which have `#Fleeting Notes`, `#Literature Notes`, `#Evergreen Notes`. etc.

        5. [[Andy Henson]]
            - Core concepts of [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam]]
                - Effortless capture of fleeting notes 
                - block references make literature notes more powerful
                - unique IDs of each block are there but don't get in the way
                - RE the system: Mindful curation of what we put in to allow us to gain compound interest on it. Zettelkasten as a lighweight system enables us to work our materials - Roam's inherent hierarchical structure lends itself to kneading our raw thoughts - into something more coherent
            - What is this system?
                - A personalised system for us to clarify our thinking towards whatever our purpose is
                    - Capturing thoughts and ideas, possibly in relation to other inputs
                    - Wrestling with those thoughts in front of us
        6. [[Wade Dominic]]
            - Core concepts of [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam]]
                - Since this is a new digital medium for capturing notes there is a lot of opportunity for exploration and experimentation. The flexibility of Roam allows a greater level of detail and a way to connect the Zettelkasten with our everyday life through journaling and goal management.
                - We are building a personal database that has increasingly advanced ways to query and analyse our notes and our life if journaling. 
                - Core concepts:
                    - Personal
                    - Flexible
                    - Trustable
                    - Building deeper connections of thought

            - Summary::
            - 
    - Step 1:: 
    - The whole workflow becomes complicated: There is the technique of underlining important sentences (sometimes in different colours or shapes), commenting in the margins of a text, writing excerpts, employing reading methods with acronyms like SQ3R[ 8] or SQ4R,[ 9] writing a journal, brainstorming a topic or following multi-step question sheets–and then there are, of course, the one thousand and twelve apps and programs that are supposed to help with learning and writing. Few of these techniques are particularly complicated in themselves, but they are usually used without any regard to the actual workflow, which then quickly becomes a mess. **As nothing really fits together, working within this arrangement becomes extremely complicated indeed and difficult to get anything done.**
    - And if you stumble upon one idea and think that it might connect to another idea, what do you do when you employ all these different techniques? Go through all your books to find the right underlined sentence? Reread all your journals and excerpts? And what do you do then? Write an excerpt about it? Where do you save it and how does this help to make new connections? Every little step suddenly turns into its own project without bringing the whole much further forward. Adding another promising technique to it, then, would make things only worse.
    - That is why the slip-box is not introduced as another technique, but as a crucial element in an overarching workflow that is stripped of everything that could distract from what is important. Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking. The slip-box provides an external scaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information.
    - That is pretty much it. To have an undistracted brain to think with and a reliable collection of notes to think in is pretty much all we need. Everything else is just clutter.

    - "^^A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas.^^ By breaking down the amorphous task of “writing a paper” into small and clearly separated tasks, you can focus on one thing at a time, complete each in one go and move on to the next one (Chapter 3.1). ^^A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975)^^. Something like that does not happen by chance. [*](((N9B8GYzJr)))"
