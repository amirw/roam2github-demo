- I want to read better
    - In china, you cannot found many (better, good or ) resource to improved yourself. The people who share their experiences always in a way to make profile, and the quality as always lower than English world
    - so, in twitter, quora ...etc English communities, I found too many good resource to learn, and I can trust on it , because the culture, chasing influences is the people who share their opinions, not directly to money.
- I want to thinking differently
    - China And West World are totally different between too many aspects. Tradition thinking is a massive gravity in the china communication, don't get me wrong , I wasn't say that Tradition were bad, the two culture's battle in my head could help me to generator some new way to think, new insight which can led me to a different world.
