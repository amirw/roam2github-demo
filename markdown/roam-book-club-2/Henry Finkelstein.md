    - ## Summary
        - Taking smart notes enhances learning, understanding, insight, and publication.
        - A system for smart notes is the Zettelkasten which spans fleeting notes, literature notes, and permanent notes. Each step is discrete and offers meaningful and notable value.
        - One's Zettelkasten is a dialogue and accountability partner in the exploration of knowledge and awareness. These dynamics are achieved with an external scaffold to expand retention while facilitating recovery, connection, and contextual resurfacing.
        - Overall, using the Zettelkasten system for PKM is compelling and just better learning & thinking technology - so why doesn't everyone Zettel?
        -  
        - **Summary Haiku**
            - Eyes now wide open
            - I Zettel therefore I flow
            - Ink rivers of growth

        - The presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin. [Page 36](((QZ6n1KZYz)))
        - The idea is not to copy, but to have a meaningful dialogue with the texts we read. [Page 75](((kfo0M_G9G)))
        - The mere copying of quotes almost always changes the meaning by stripping them out of context, even though the words aren't changed. [PageÂ 75](((zrdVApH_V)))
        - If you spend your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn. [Page 105](((_DTyJJSSR)))

    - ## Random thoughts
        - The awareness that Zettelkasten is a crystallization seed and a path forward for a massive project that will take the next 50 years to develop (#GIFT)
        - **Sanke said: Every idea has its time - love that!**
            - I have heard this plenty of times before. Means extra a lot to me now because it is so spot because so many ideas (Roam, Zettel, GIFT, Life, Thrive, etc) are having their time in me right now!
        - Curious: "**Worldly wisdom**" as many mental models. Is GIFT a metta-lattice of evidence-based models?
        - Social entropy exists.
            - Is there such a concept of **social entropy**? Core idea as relationships tend to fall apart, so we must be actively tending the garden of relating.
        - Each sense has its own biases.
            - Trust no one sense to triangulate "truth".
                - The strength, resiliency and power of ^^**not trusting any one sense or intuition is to look at what's behind the veil of all of them**^^
        - Sales conjures the feel-state of greater thriving.
            - Sales is partially about creating the feel state of a future with fewer / less painful problems
        - We are all hardwired to thrive #UTT
            - So why not thrive?
                - Don't know how OR not enough practice
                    - Years 0 - 5 study and develop an evidence-based, academically validated "Unified Theory of Thriving (UTT)"
                        - This will include over 1000 academic articles, over 100 non-fiction books, and interviews, all zettled into a web of interconnected brilliance
                        - The initial iteration of UTT will only be the starting point to begin our practice. 
                    - Years 5 - 10 is building and refining the practice
                        - The UTT will be the launchpad for building a profitable practice. Once we're up and running, we'll continue digesting relevant literature and we'll also start generating our own 
                            - make a short list of academics with whom we'd like to work to fill in certain knowledge gaps
                            - begin formulating gold standard research to test and validate the UTT model
                            - refine and iterate
        - Human capacity is inherently limited
            - Limited attention
            - Limited memory
            - Limited willpower / motivation
        - Humans are unique in how quickly we build tools and systems to expand our capacity
        - Why am I so drawn to Elon Musk?
            - Aspirations - what would it mean to be ^^**the "Elon Musk" of healthcare (less the bad boy facade / stupid antics)? of mysticism?**^^
                - What is my / our moonshot goal? Maybe bridging science into the spiritual realm / Life realm
        - Personal workflow optimization maximizes productivity
            - ^^**Personal workflow optimization - how we initiate parallel background processes is a huge multiplier and meta skill**^^
        - I seek to cultivate in my writing a well-developed voice and style.
            - **Key concepts in my writing**
                - bridge building
                - distillation
                - translation
                - questioning
                - corroboration
                - structure
                - simplifcation
                - process
                - transparency
        - Intuition is different from connection to Source / Spirit / Life / God / Divine (whatever word is resonant for any given individual)

                    - The quality of one's writing depends on the quality of one's notes before one starts writing. 
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    - I really appreciate this concept and it reminds me of the Zen buddhist saying of "how you do one thing is how you do every thing"
                        - If we can atomize our tasks well, and then do each of them well, then strong execution is an expected emergent outcome of such a system
                    - I like this concept as it continues to resonate throughout the book. If I am diligent and consistent in taking smart notes on everything I consume, then I will become increasingly sharp and well-researched in my writing (and thinking!) over time.
                    - This also plays in, slightly, to the idea of the accumulation of smart notes over time.
                    - How much of my day is writing?!?!
                    - Reminds me of [[Daniel Pink]]'s [[To Sell is Human]] where writing is paralleled with persuasion
            - #Zettels [[Increase writing throughput by implementing systems that remove resistance with well-defined, meaningful tasks]] (starting with smart notes then moving through the creation pipeline to output)
                - Related topics: #willpower #resistance #motivation #productivity
                - #[[Literature Notes]] [Intro, Page 5](((EyGC2LlUm)))
                    - Reduce the need to use willpower to write by aligning short- and long-term interests with meaningful, well-defined tasks such as smart notes.
                    - Not needing willpower (by setting ourselves up for success) is better than having it and using it.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    - This reminds me of [[The Willpower Instinct]] and how forceful it feels to try to "strengthen willpower" instead of simply removing resistance
                    - I very much like this idea. Brings up the concept of resistance and where / when / why do we feel resistance to do the things we want to do?
                        - The assumption in this statement is that we feel resistance whenever our short- and longer-term interests are not aligned. I'll have to noodle on whether that is always the case, or just incidental to 
            - #Zettels [[Insight-oriented writing requires system flexibility and fluidity to keep options open and to enter flow state. Rich, interconnected insights are more likely with bottom-up idea generation.]]
                - Related topics: #flow #productivity #insight #[[impact writing]]
                - #[[Literature Notes]] [Page 16](((S5mIxanir)))
                    - Insight-oriented writing is inherently fluid in that awareness shifts as one learns, understands, and thinks more.
                    - A system that is flexible enough to allow for adjustments to realign interest, motivation, and productivity will bring us closer to flow state.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    - I like the visual that ideas are like butterfly or sprites that float on by. They hang out with me for just a little while, and if I don't engage then they flutter on over to the next recipient.
                        - In that way, this system allows me to get the phone number of the butterfly or sprite so that, even if now isn't the right time, maybe we can hang out later when the time is right
                    - Framed in the light of "keep your options open during the writing process" it really begs the question for how to pull more bottom-up thinking into children's education
                    - I really appreciate the phrase "insight-oriented writing" and the awareness that, by necessity, such writing is fluid in nature with increasing rigidity leading up to the moments right before publication.
            - #[[Literature Notes]] [Page 104](((VR-Gqqmwt))) #learning #writing
                - Elaboration is core to understanding and writing.
                - First, think about information to write about it. Then, apply that information to different contexts.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    - I like the idea of elaboration as core to learning
            - #[[Literature Notes]] [Page 145](((IlOru3EP8))) #editing #writing
                - One of the hardest things to do is "kill your darlings"
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    - Ha! I did the same exact thing with my bschool applications. I had a "cutting floor" doc that "saved" all the garbage I never ended up looking at again.
                        - Not 100% true, I did use it just once to pull a sentence back from the dead. But generally, 99% went to trash and it's just a comfort blanket of intellectual hoarding.
                    - I find the framing of "kill your darlings" too violent for my word map, though I appreciate the core message and concept.

                    - Notes & computers do not facilitate science or other intellectual efforts - they are the medium of thinking.

                    - Writing facilitates rich understanding so we may as well use our notes to prepare for future publications.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    - Very much agreed that the act of thinking about and consolidating concepts forces a deeper understanding of the core material. I resonate with the idea that making more connections is fundamental to rich understanding.
                    - This is an example of aligning short- (understanding) and longer-term incentives (publications) to make the process smoother and more fluid

                    - Take fleeting notes - any idea or thought that comes to you - and place them in an inbox for processing later.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    - This reminds me of GTD's Inbox. That is what [[Nat Eliason]] implemented in his workflow and what I'm using now.
                    - There is something strangely validating about writing down every single thought. I only write down the thoughts that matter, so if I'm writing it down, then it must matter. Even when I later throw away some blocks, it still feels good to fully dump all ideas, tasks, projects into my Roam inbox.
            - #[[Literature Notes]] [Page 24](((ayX3LRSkz))) #[[idea generation]]
                - The purpose of a zettelkasten is to develop ideas, arguments, and discussions.

                    - You have achieved clean separation of each note phase when you close your project folder in the evening and the desk is empty.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    - The amount of calm I feel from pouring all my thoughts into Roam is pretty substantial. And it shockingly takes away a lot of the urgency to work ultra-hard because there is compound interest on every fleeting, literature, linking, and permanent notes. The more thoughtfully each note is created, the higher the ROI rate and dividends later.

                    - I appreciate the point, and the metaphor to fast food is evocative, but I'm not sure I exactly agree here. We know that young children seek structure (is this true? or is this just a current cultural norm that's being projected through a lens of qualified anxiety replacing thoughtful cautionary balance of learning to fall?) and the we generally learn better with methods and frameworks (is this true either? prove it).
                    - Generally, though, I agree the spoon feeding information (which is what most of my education felt like) is not a compelling answer either. Allowing for greater scope of exploration and self-discovered connections is value and I agree could have more focus. Just don't think structure and clarity of direction is all that bad when applied thoughtfully. (Can I prove that with evidence-based reasoning and rationale?)

    - ### Highlights
        - The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written **depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic**. (PageÂ 3)
        - The research on willpower or ^^[[ego depletion]]^^ is in a bit of turmoil at the moment. But it is safe to say that using willpower is a terrible strategy to get things done in the long run. For an overview: https://replicationindex.wordpress.com/2016/04/18/is-replicability-report-ego-depletionreplicability-report-of-165-ego-depletion-articles/ (PageÂ 4) #[[To Research]]
        - Luckily, this is not the whole story. We know today that [[self-control]] and [[self-discipline]] have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) - and **the environment can be changed**. Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn't one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway.

**Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long- and shortterm interests**. ^^**Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time**^^. Not having [[willpower]], but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play. (PageÂ 5)
        - His slip-box became his ^^**dialogue partner, main idea generator and [[productivity engine]]**^^. It helped him to structure and develop his thoughts. (PageÂ 13)
        - The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, ^^**it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea**^^. It is in the nature of writing, especially insight-oriented writing, that questions change, the material we work with turns out to be different from the one be er very imagined or that new ideas emerge, which might change our whole perspective on what we do. Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work. (PageÂ 16)
        - (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). (PageÂ 17) #[[To Research]]
        - **Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head. ** (PageÂ 23)
        - "Notes on paper, or a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible," neuroscientist [[Neil Levy]] concludes in the introduction to the [[Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics]] #[[To Research]], summarizing decades of research. Neuroscientists, psychologists and other experts on thinking have very different ideas about how our brains work, but, as Levy writes: "**no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding**." (2011, 270) (PageÂ 23)
        - If we write, it is more likely that we understand what we read, remember what we learn and that our thoughts make sense. ^^**And if we have to write anyway, why not use our writing to build up the resources for our future publications?**^^ (PageÂ 23)
        - Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write to capture every idea that worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on. **These are fleeting notes, mere reminders of what is in pops into your mind**. Don't your bead. They should not cause any distraction. **Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later.** (PageÂ 23)
        - The idea is not to collect, but to **develop ideas, arguments and discussions**. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What actions are triggered by them? (PageÂ 24)
        - **Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help **^^**to reduce distractions from the main work**^^, which here is thinking. (PageÂ 29)
        - I strongly recommend using a free program like **Zotero** #[[To Research]], which allows you to make new entries via browser plugins or just by entering the ISBN or digital object identifier (DOI) number. [[Zotero]] also can be integrated into Microsoft Word, OpenOffice, LibreOffice and NeoOffice, which allows you to insert quotations without actually typing in the reference. That not only makes things easier, you also mitigate the risk of messing things up when you add, edit or delete additional references. (PageÂ 30)
        - Google [[Monty Python]] "How to Play the Flute". (PageÂ 32)
            - Did this. Moderately funny and proves the point that simplistic and reductive explanations are ludicrous
        - Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community under public scrutiny. **There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia.** ^^An idea kept private is as good as one you never had.^^

And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas. (PageÂ 36)
        - This is why ^^**the presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin**^^ (Peters and SchÃ¤fer 2006, 9). (PageÂ 36) #[[To Research]]
        - You also have to think beyond the things you read, because you need to turn it into something new. And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. **Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing** (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008). (PageÂ 38) #[[To Research]]
        - **When you close the folder for your current project in the evening and **^^**nothing is left on your desk other than pen and paper**^^**, you know that you have achieved a clear separation between fleeting, permanent and project-related notes.** (PageÂ 46)
        - [[Feedback loops]] are not only crucial for the dynamics of motivation, but also the key element to any learning process. Nothing motivates us more than the experience of becoming better at what we do. And the only chance to improve in something is getting timely and concrete feedback. **Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn**, or in the more general terms of psychologist [[Carol Dweck]], to grow. Dweck shows convincingly that the ^^**most reliable predictor for long-term success is having a "growth mindset."**^^ To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (and happiness) in the long run. (PageÂ 53)
        - We know for example that **watching television reduces the attention span of children** (Swing et al. 2010). We also know that the average length of TV soundbites has steadily declined over the last several decades (Fehrmann, 2011). (PageÂ 57) #[[To Research]]
        - **While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased a lot** (wang andTchernev 2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009). *Not only the quantity but also the quality of their accomplishments lagged **significantly behind that of the control group. (PageÂ 58) #[[To Research]]
        - In short, academic writing requires the whole spectrum of attention. To master the art of writing, we need to be able to apply whatever kind of attention and focus is needed. Psychologists used to associate scientific work exclusively with focussed attention, while other, more floating kinds of attention were exclusively associated with creative work like art.

**We know today that we need both kinds of attention for art and science**. It is not surprising, therefore, that this flexibility can be among most, if not all, exceptional scientists. [[Oshin Vartanian]] **compared and analysed the daily workflows of Nobel Prize winners and other eminent scientists and concluded that is not a relentless focus, but **^^**flexible focus**^^** that distinguishes them**. "Specifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent tentists can alternate between **extraordinary levels of focus on eclectic concepts and playful exploration of ideas**. This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible 20ky application in relation to task demands." (Vartanian 2009, 57) (PageÂ 63)
        - **Real experts**, Flyvbjerg writes unambiguously, **don't make plans** (Flyvbjerg 2001, 19). (PageÂ 67) #[[To Research]]
        - Being able to finish a task in a timely manner and to pick up the work exactly where we left it has another enjoyable advantage that helps to restore our attention: **We can have breaks without fear of losing the thread**. Breaks are much more than just opportunities to recover. ^^**They are crucial for learning.**^^ They allow the brain to process information, move it into longterm memory and prepare it for new information (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013, 69)." (PageÂ 73) #[[To Research]]
        - The outcome of reading with a pen of in the hand is not possible to anticipate either, and here, too, the idea is not to copy, but to **have a meaningful dialogue with the texts we read**. (PageÂ 75)
        - Translating means to give the truest possible account of the original work, using different words it does not mean the freedom to make something up. As well, **the mere copying of quotes almost always changes the meaning by stripping them out of context**, even though the words aren't changed. (PageÂ 75)
        - There is no secret to it and the explanation is pretty simple: Handwriting is slower and can't be corrected as quickly as electronic notes. Because students can't write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are **forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details**. But to be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in the first place. So if you are writing by hand, you are forced to think about what you hear (or read) - otherwise be able to grasp the underlying principle, the idea, the structure of an argument. **Handwriting makes pure copying impossible, but instead facilitates the translation of what is said** (or written) into one's own words. The students who typed into their laptops were much quicker, which enabled them to copy the lecture more closely but circumvented actual understanding. They focused on completeness. Verbatim notes can be taken with almost no thinking, as if the words are taking a short cut from the ear to the hand, bypassing the brain. (PageÂ 78)
        - **Developing arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of topdown is the first and most important step to **^^**opening ourselves up for insight**^^. We should be able to focus on the most insightful ideas we encounter and welcome the most surprising turns of events without jeopardizing our progress or, even better, because it brings our project forward. We postpone the decision on what to write about specifically and focus on building a critical mass within the slip-box. Instead of having the hypothesis in mind all the time, we want to:

1. ^^**Confirm that we have separated tasks and focus on understanding the text we read**^^
2. ^^**Make sure we have given a true account of its content**^^
3. ^^**Find the relevance of it and make connections.**^^

Only then do we take a step back to look at what developed, then make a decision on what conclusions are to be drawn from that. (PageÂ 81)
        - One of the most important habitual changes when starting to work with the slipbox is moving the attention from the individual project with our preconceived ideas towards the **connections within the slip-box. **(PageÂ 81)
        - The ^^**slip-box is pretty agnostic about the content it is fed**^^. It just prefers relevant notes. It is after reading and collecting relevant data, connecting thoughts and discussing how they fit together that it is time to draw conclusions and develop a linear structure for the argument. (PageÂ 82)
        - It is proven that **readers regard an author and an audience a speaker as **^^**more intelligent**^^** the more clear and to the point their expressions** are (Oppenheimer 2006). (PageÂ 84) #[[To Research]]
        - The ability to spot patterns, to question the frames used and detect the distinctions made by others, is the precondition to thinking critically and looking behind the assertions of a text or a talk. **Being able to re-frame questions, assertions and information is even more important than having an extensive knowledge, because without this ability, we wouldn't be able to  put our knowledge to use. **The good news is that these skills can be learned. But it requires deliberate practice (Ericsson, Krampe, and Tesch-RÃ¶mer 1993; Anders Ericsson 2008). **Taking smart notes is the deliberate practice of these skills.** Mere reading, underlining sentences and hoping to remember the content is not. (PageÂ 85)
        - This is why **choosing an external system that forces us to **^^**deliberate practice**^^** and confronts us as much as possible with our lack of understanding or not-yet-learned information is such a smart move**. We only have to make the conscious choice once. (PageÂ 87)
        - how much effort teachers still put into the attempt to make learning easier for their students by prearranging information, sorting it into modules, categories and themes. By doing that, they achieve the opposite of what they intend to do. They make it harder for the student to learn because they set everything up for reviewing, taking away the opportunity to build meaningful connections and to make sense of something by translating it into one's own language. It is like fast food: It is neither nutritious nor very enjoyable, it is just convenient. (PageÂ 88)
        - ^^**When we try to answer a question before we know how to, we will later remember the answer better, even if our attempt failed** ^^(Arnold and McDermott 2013). (PageÂ 88) #[[To Research]]
        - The educational psychologist [[Kirsti Lonka]] compared the reading approach of unusually successful doctoral candidates and students with those who were much less successful. One difference stood out as critical: The ^^**ability to think beyond the given frames of a text**^^ (Lonka 2003, 155f). (PageÂ 90) #[[To Research]]
        - Putting notes into the slip-box, however, is like investing and reaping the rewards of compounded interest (PageÂ 93)
        - "[[Genius: The Life And Science of Richard Feynman]]," [[James Gleick]], Pantheon Books, 1992 (see pg. 409). (PageÂ 95) #[[To Research]]
        - But the first question I asked myself when it came to writing the first permanent note for the slip-box was: **What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box?** This is just another way of asking: ^^**Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest? **^^(PageÂ 97)
        - But it also became clear that this advantage came at a huge cost: It wasn't just that Shereshevsky was able to remember so much, he had trouble forgetting anything. The important things got lost under a pile of irrelevant details that involuntarily came to his mind. Although he was very good at remembering facts, Shereshevsky was almost incapable of getting the gist of something, the concepts behind the particulars and distinguishing the relevant facts from minor details. He had great trouble relating to literature or poetry. **He could repeat a novel word by word, but the greater meaning would be lost on him.** (PageÂ 100)
        - Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of a mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory. Psychologists call this mechanism [[active inhibition]] (cf. MacLeod, 2007). #[[To Research]] It is easy to understand what it is good for: Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings. That is what [[Shereshevsky]] struggled with in his life: There were moment where he tried to buy an ice cream, but some random word of the vendor triggered **such an enormous amount of associations and memonies  that he would have to leave the shop, so **^^**overwhelming was this experience.**^^ (PageÂ 100)
        - Robert and Elizabeth Ligon Bjork from the University of California suggest distinguishing between two different measurements when it comes to memory: Storage strength and retrieval strength (Bjork 2011). They speculate that storage strength, the ability to store memories, only becomes greater over one's lifetime. We add more and more information to our long-term memory. Just by looking at the physical capacity of our brains, we can see that we could indeed probably store a lifetime and a bit of detailed experiences in it (Carey 2014, 42). #[[To Research]]

It is difficult, if not impossible, to verify this claim, but it does make sense to shift the attention from storage strength to retrieval strength. **Learning would be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk, but about **^^**building connections and bridges between pieces of information**^^** to circumvent the inhibition mechanism in the right moment.** It is about making sure that the right "cues" trigger the right memory, (PageÂ 101) #[[To Research]]
        - When [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], the godfather of [[learning theory]] #[[To Research]], tried to understand the basics of learning and measuring learning progress, he deliberately used meaningless bits of information like random letter combinations and made sure they bore no accidental meaning.

From his understanding, meaning would distract from the actual learning process. But he didn't realise that **he was stripping the learning process from the very thing that is learning**, which is making meaningful connections. (PageÂ 103)
        - The challenge of writing as well as learning is therefore not so much to learn, but to understand, as ^^**we will already have learned what we understand**^^. The problem is that the meaning of something is not always obvious and needs to be explored.

That is why we need to elaborate on it. But elaboration is nothing more than connecting information to other information in a meaningful way. **The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well.** (PageÂ 104)
        - **If you spend your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn.** But if you focus your time and energy on learning without trying to understand, you will not only not understand, but also probably not learn. (PageÂ 105)
        - The fact that too much order can impede learning has become more and more known (Carey 2014). #[[To Research]] Conversely, we know that the deliberate creation of variations and contrasts can facilitate learning. [[Nate Kornell]] and Bjork #[[To Research]] showed this when they experimentally taught students different art styles. First, they used the traditional approach of showing students one art style at a time using different paintings. Then, they deliberately mixed up the styles and shuffled the paintings around. The students who were presented paintings from different styles in no particular order learned to distinguish styles faster and were also much more successful at matching paintings to styles and artists they had never seen before. This shows that elaborating on differences and similarities of notes instead of sorting them by topic not only facilitates learning, but facilitates the ability to categorise and create sensible classifications! (PageÂ 106)
        - Build a [[Latticework of Mental Models]] (PageÂ 107)
        - Because the slip-box is not intended to be an encyclopaedia, but a tool to think with, ^^**we don't need to worry about completeness**^^. We don't need to write anything down just to bridge a gap in a note sequence. We only write if it helps us with our own thinking. The gaps we do need to concern ourselves with are the gaps in the arguments in the final manuscript- but these gaps will only become obvious in the next step, when we take the relevant notes for an argument out of the network of the slip-box and sort them into the linear order for the rough draft. (PageÂ 108)
        - **Comparing notes also helps us to detect contradictions, paradoxes or oppositions - important facilitators for insight.** When we realise that we used to accept two contradicting ideas as equally true, we know that we have a problem - and **problems are good because we now have something to solve**. A paradox can be a sign that we haven't thought thoroughly enough about a problem or, conversely, that we exhausted the possibilities of a certain paradigm. Finally, oppositions help to shape ideas by providing contrast. [[Albert Rothenberg]] suggests that the construction of oppositions is the most reliable way of generating new ideas (Rothenberg 1971; 1996; 2015) #[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 116)
        - The slip-box not only confronts us with dis-confirming information, but also helps with what is known as the [[featurepositive effect]] (Allison and Messick 1988; Newman, Wolff, and Hearst 1980; Sainsbury 1971) #[[To Research]]. This is **the phenomenon in which we tend to overstate the importance of information that is (mentally) easily available to us and tilts our thinking towards the most recently acquired facts, not necessarily the most relevant ones**. Without external help, we would not only take exclusively into account what we know, but what is on top of our heads." The **slip-box constantly reminds us of information we have long forgotten** and wouldn't remember otherwise much so, we wouldn't even look for it. (PageÂ 117)
        - ^^**We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications (elaboration), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), ideally with the help of chance (contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort (retrieval).** ^^The slip-box not only provides us with the opportunity to learn in this proven way, it forces us to do exactly what is recommended just by using it. We have to elaborate on what we read just to be able to write it down and translate it into different contexts. We retrieve information from the slipbox whenever we try to connect new notes with old notes. Just by doing this, we mix up contexts, shuffle notes and retrieve the information in irregular intervals. And along the way, we further elaborate on the information, which we always retrieve deliberately. (PageÂ 120)
        - Being experienced with a problem and intimately familiar with the tools and devices we work with, **ideally to the point of virtuosity**, is the precondition for discovering their inherent possibilities, writes [[Ludwik Fleck]], a historian of science (Fleck 2012, 126) #[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 121)
        - But [[intuition]] is not the opposition to rationality and knowledge, **it is rather the incorporated, practical side of our intellectual endeavours, the sedimented experience on which we build our conscious, explicit knowledge** (cf. Ahrens 2014) #[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 122)
        - **Creative people are better at recognizing relationships, making associations and connections and seeing things in an original way-seeing things that others cannot see**" (Andreasen 2014) #[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 123)
        - ^^**The real enemy of independent thinking is not an external authority, but our own inertia.**^^ (PageÂ 124)
            - That's a real zinger of quote
        - In their book with the showy title "[[ðŸ“™ The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking]]", the mathematicians [[Edward B. Burger]] and [[Michael Starbird]] collected different strategies to do that (2012) #[[To Research]]. Some are already technically implemented in the slip-box, others are good to keep in mind. (PageÂ 125)
        - Another piece of advice is not a feature of the slip-box and might sound banal, but it is crucial: Make sure that you really what see you think you see and describe it as plainly and factually as possible. Double-check if necessary. That this isn't as obvious as it sounds will become clearer by the fact that the ability to truly see what is in front of one's eyes is often listed as a trait of experts.

**And that is easily explained by the fact that our perception does not follow the order of seeing first and interpreting second. It does both at the same time: We always perceive something as something - our interpretation is instantaneous. This is why we have so much trouble not falling for an optical illusion**:

we look at a three-dimensional drawing, we cannot see it just s an arrangement of lines and shapes - unless we are highly rained to do so. We don't even notice objectively missing parts in our perception, like the blind spot in the middle of everything we see. We need a trick to see what we don't see. As we always immediately see a whole picture of something, everything else, including the reinterpretation of it or the detection of missing bits, is a step that follows. (PageÂ 125)
        - To be able to see what we see instead of what we expect to see is indeed a skill in itself, not like a character trait of being "open-minded." ^^**Those who think of themselves as being openminded are often even more prone to stick to their first understanding as they believe to be without natural prejudices and therefore don't see the need to counterbalance them**^^. If we think we can "hold back" an interpretation, we are fooling ourselves. (PageÂ 126)
        - In his beautifully titled book "[[The Antidote: Happiness for People Who Can't Stand Positive Thinking]]," [[Oliver Burkeman]] #[[To Research]] describes how much our culture is focused on success and how we neglect the important lessons from failure (Burkeman 2013)#[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 127)
        - "**The principle is that you must not fool yourself, and **^^**you are the easiest person to fool**^^," Feynman stressed in a speech to young scientists (Feynman 1985, 342) #[[To Research]]. (Page 128)
        - **We tried to emulate birds by flapping wing-like apparatuses with feathers and all, but in the end, as about not getting distracted by details and discovering that the **^^**subtle bending of the wing is the only thing that counts. **^^(PageÂ 129)
        - This kind of self-imposed restriction is counterintuitive in a culture where more choice is usually regarded as a good thing and more tools to choose from seen as better than having less at hand. But not having to make decisions can be quite liberating. In his book "[[ðŸ“™ The Paradox of Choice]]," [[Barry Schwartz]] #[[To Research]] used numerous examples, from shopping to career options to romance to show that less choice can not only increase our productivity but also our freedom and make it easier to be in the moment and enjoy it (Schwartz, 2007)#[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 130)
        - **Thinking and creativity can flourish under restricted conditions and there are plenty of studies to back that claim** (cf. Stokes 2001; Rheinberger 1997)#[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 131)
        - The brain more easily remembers information that it **encountered recently, which has emotions attached to it and is lively, concrete or specific. Idealy, it rhymes as well** (cf. Schacter, 2001; Schacter, Chiao and  Mitchell, 2003) #[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 133)
        - It makes things worse that ^^**we tend to like our first ideas the best and are very reluctant to let go of them**^^**, irrespective of their actual relevance** (Strack and Mussweiler 1997)#[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 134)
        - **Good questions are in the sweet spot of being relevant and interesting, not too easy to answer but possible to tackle with material that is available or at least within our reach**. (PageÂ 136)
        - On the contrary: The more time an artist devotes to learning about an aesthetic "problem," the more unexpected and creative his solution will be regarded later by art experts (Getzels and Csikszentmihalyi 1976) #[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 137)
        - [[Jeremy Dean]], who has written extenvely on routines and rituals and suggests seeing old ways of thunking as thinking routines, puts it well when he writes that ^^**we cannot break with a certain way of thinking if we are not even aware that it is a certain way of thinking**^^ (Dean, 2013) #[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 137)
        - It is not surprising that ^^**motivation is shown to be one of the most important indicators for successful students **^^- next to the teeling of being in control of one's own learning course. **When even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it's mostly because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the sense of control to make their own studies autonomously and on their terms (Reeve and Jan, 2006; Reeve, 2009)**.#[[To Research]] (PageÂ 137)
        - Organizing the work so we can steer our projects in the most promising direction not only allows us to stay focused for longer, but also to have more fun and that is a fact (Gilbert 2006). #[[To Research]]" (PageÂ 139)
        - But there is one consolation: It has nothing to do with being a student. It has something to do with being human. **Even the people who study this phenomenon, which is called the **[[overconfidence bias]]**, admit that they too fall for it** (Kahneman 2013, 245ff)#[[To Research]]. (Page 142)
        - The lesson to draw is to be ^^**generally sceptical about planning, especially if it is merely focused on the outcome, not on the actual work and the steps required to achieve a goal**^^. While it doesn't help to imagine oneself the great author of a successtul and timely finished paper, it does make a difference if we have a realistic idea about what needs to be done to get there in our minds. We know from sports that it doesn't help when athletes imagine themselves as winners of a race, but it makes a big difference if they imagine all the training that is necessary to be able to win. **Having a more realistic idea in mind not only helps them to perform better, it also boosts their motivation** (Singer  et al. 2001)#[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 143)
        - This is partly due to the aforementioned [[Zeigarnik effect]] (Zeigarnik 1927)#[[To Research]], in which **our brains tend to stay occupied with a task until it is accomplished (or written down)**. If we have the finish line in sight, we tend to speed up, as everyone knows who has ever run a marathon. That means that the most important step is to get started. **Rituals help, too** (Currey 2013)#[[To Research]]. (Page 144)
        - **One of the most difficult tasks is to rigorously delete what has no function within an argument  - kill your darlings**. yourThis becomes much easier when you move the questionable pasinto another document and tell yourself you might use "kill your darlings."42 sages them later. For every document I write, I have another called "xy-rest.doc," and every single time I cut something, I copy it into the other document, convincing myself that I will later look through it and add it back where it might fit. ^^**Of course, it never happens - but it still works**^^. Others who know a thing or two about psychology do the same (cf. Thaler, 2015, 81f)#[[To Research]]. (PageÂ 145)
        - "Those with the strongest habits who were the least successful in predicting their behaviour over the coming week were the most confident in their predictions. The finding is striking because it hints at one of the dark sides of habits. **When we perform an action repeatedly, its familiarity seems to bleed back into our judgments about that behavior. We end up feeling we have more control over precisely the behav Jours that, in reality, we have the least control over. It's al other **^^**example of our thought processes working n the posite way to our intuitive expectations**^^." (Dean 2013, 22)#[[To Research]] (PageÂ 146)

    - # Outline
        - ## Intro
            - __Objective: Helping others implement Zettelkasten in Roam.__
                - I consume a lot of non-fiction texts and academic articles to formulate a coherent and consistent evidence-based worldview.
                - But because I read a lot, I also forget a lot, and that makes my mental model a leaky bucket that constantly needs filling. No matter how much I pour in, most of it splashes out the bottom, so I just have to pour ever more to keep the bucket half full.
                    - If that sounds exhausting and depressing to you, then I'm right there with you. I mostly came to terms and gave up on that dynamic ever changing.
                - Then I found Roamkasten. Roamkasten is a recently coined term (kudos Joey Harris!) that refers to implementing the Zettelkasten system in Roam Research. Roam + Zettelkasten = Roamkasten. Cute, right?
                - Roamkasten notably changed everything in my awareness around personal knowledge management (PKM). Specifically, this system unlocks superhuman powers of cognition and consciousness:
                    - 100% retention of everything I ever read
                    - Rich, deep understanding of each text far beyond that of my baseline reading style
                    - Contextualized rapid recall of core concepts, implications, and reference materials exactly when they are relevant to a project I'm working on or a piece I'm writing
                    - Integrating evidence, ideas, and arguments into a diligently documented personal worldview
                    - Developing connections between disparate domains that I'd never link with my baseline mental models
                    - Actively challenging my own insights and positions by structurally mitigating cognitive biases
                    - Achieving all this in a way that minimizes effort, decreases cognitive burden, releases stress and guilt, improves motivation, and positions me for greater success in any undertaking moving forward
                - Clearly, I'm sold. 
                - But it took me ~8 weeks and over 100 hours of hard, focused effort trudging up the mountain before I saw the epic vistas and fully grasped the glory of the Roamkasten landscape. Once I got over the joy of summiting, I realized that there is a much simpler, shorter path to get here. D'oh!
                - My objective here is to save time for others by mapping my route for those interested in walking the Roamkasten path. This article is written linearly to speak to the what and why before the how, though feel free to skip sections that you already know to save time. After all, my biggest win is getting you to the top of the mountain as quickly and effortlessly as possible. 
                - Let's jump right in by addressing why anyone would ever care about a Roamkasten system - to cure cognitive constipation.

        - ## Do you have cognitive constipation? Symptoms, root cause, and the cure
            - __Key Transmission: Why would anyone care about Roamkasten? Who is this post for?__
                - For the last 5 years, I had a nagging suspicion my reading style was sub-optimal. I felt like I was consuming, but not digesting and processing, so I frequently felt cognitive constipation. Tell me if any of my symptoms resonate with your experience:
                    - I would go through binge & purge cycles of reading. 
                        - I'd get interested in a topic, read a bunch about it, and then feel "full" like I cannot read another line.
                            - Beyond not feeling good, this sensation was hugely demotivating and limited my forward progress and intellectual growth
                        - I could not consume any more content until I "cleared" my system (read: forgot a large chunk of what I just read)
                            - Man, what a waste of time! Why read at all if retention and recall drop off to near zero as I purge for the next thing I'll soon forget?
                    - I could only vaguely remember core concepts and arguments made in books I read not too long ago
                    - I would look at a stack of books that I bought because they genuinely interest me and instantly felt overwhelmed and uninspired
                    - I was reading without taking any meaningful notes which yielded a shallow level of learning, understanding, and insight.
                        - (personal preference oddity: I can't stand highlighting or writing directly in book margins, but those aren't meaningful notes anyways) 
                - I was reading good quality information, but not processing it in any way. Reading like this is the equivalent of a healthy literary diet with a twisted intellect gut. Even though I feel good about what I read in the moment, the material doesn't offer much nutrition and is entirely unsatisfying and not nourishing in the long run. No wonder I felt cognitive constipation so much of the time!
                - If any of this resonates with you, you're in good company and it's perfectly normal. I posit 3 root causes for this experience:
                    - From Pre-K through PhD (at least in the US), we are never taught how to fully digest information or take meaningful notes
                    - There are very few role models for how to actively read well (though this is changing in select rapidly growing communities)
                    - The process to actively read and take meaningful notes is not intuitive and hard to figure out in a vacuum
                - So the cards have not been stacked in our favor, but I'm about to put the royal flush in your hand.
                - To cure my cognitive constipation, I knew I had to change the fundamentals of how I digest information. Without any clarity on process, I knew my purpose was to:
                    - Increase retention
                    - Improve recall
                    - Distill core concepts and how I can apply them to my life
                    - Feel more inspired and engaged with every book I read
                - I found all that, and surprisingly much, much more, with Roamkasten. Next I'll speak to Roam (a digital tool), then Zettelkasten (a framework and process), and finally how to maximize their value by using them together.
        - ## What is Roam Research? And why is there a #RoamCult?
            - __Key Transmission: Roam is a new online software that takes learning but is incredibly powerful. People are rightly obsessed because it's a quantum leap in value and power from any other note taking tool I've used before.__
                - [Roam Research](www.RoamResearch.com) is a relatively young cloud-based "note taking tool for networked thought". If that means something to you, then you're lightyears ahead of where I was when I first stumbled on Roam. I did not get any of it but I was curious why so many smart people were obsessing about this new software, so back in October 2020 I jumped in to take a gander.
                - My first reaction was that Roam looks like a funky minimalist text editor that uses bullet points for every line. It felt unfamiliar and unintuitive from the get go, and like many new users, confusion and uncertainty were my first reactions. But trust me, it's worth pushing through the initial discomfort.
                - The three fundamental conceptual assets of Roam are bi-directional linking, blocks + children blocks, and inline creation. We'll use each of these liberally in our Roamkasten.
                    - ### Bi-directional linking
                        - Bi-directional linking looks and feels a lot like a wiki ... with a twist. Any page or block within Roam can link to any other page or block, much like a website or wiki. But the twist is that once a link is created, it instantly points both ways. So if I link my [[Obsessive Communities]] page to the [[RoamCult]] page like so

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FXOPIxxkWqN.png?alt=media&token=fbcee485-75d2-4180-a3a2-1b4dea5320c2)

then on the [[RoamCult]] page the system instantly and automatically links to the [[Obsessive Communities]] page and shows the full linked content block like so

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FPqK5Y9coCs.png?alt=media&token=4f4ffa81-47ee-4e06-9dcd-a73236d19f0c)
__note: I did not include the other linked references in my screenshot, and they are to this very article because I write in Roam__
                        - Even more interesting, if I mention RoamCult on the [[Kind and supportive people]] page, __but do not explicitly link it__, like so

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FeiKUtSJUlo.png?alt=media&token=3c4d74ba-dbfe-4556-814b-31285e76c313)

then on the [[RoamCult]] page the system instantly and automatically shows the unlinked reference like so

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FohomWAIYG8.png?alt=media&token=9558d709-a127-4083-8485-4f03b6261d73)

                        - This seems innocuous at first but becomes incredibly powerful very quickly for browsing and discovery. So much so that I now find myself wishing wikis and websites also had this function.
                    - ### Blocks & children blocks
                        - Each bullet point in Roam is called a block, and it can have an infinitely nested series of child blocks below it. Visually, a child block is indented underneath it's parent, much like a sub-bullet. For example,

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2Fedr1HrGG2q.png?alt=media&token=2176583e-e478-4537-a86e-358eb143c644)
                        - To put information in a child block inherently suggests a relationship with its parent block. This could be elaboration, observation, referencing another page or block, examples, contradictions, or any other relevancy.
                        - When I want to only see the "big picture" concepts, I can collapse children blocks to the desired level of granularity
 
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2Fnf5FDjFVfd.png?alt=media&token=27b9aba4-3c4a-48d3-9efd-6c51a82a2dfc)

or even up to the tippy top

![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FnTJV-4MUCX.png?alt=media&token=69ba7aaa-1d5a-4958-9b9a-5eae5d015265)
                        - This simple visual trick is tremendously helpful to not get lost in the details of a thought process, written text, project plan, argument, or anything else with child blocks.
                        - Another nifty thing about blocks is that, if I want to only work on one specific branch of thought and reduce distraction, I can focus on that block exclusively
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2F-qhH9Zn66D.png?alt=media&token=ccb65186-c0a7-485a-bd7d-8a91d65529e0)
                        - In doing so, I can clearly see where this block sits in the nested hierarchy (in the header section), but I don't see anything else but that one block. This enables me to stay focused and precise on what I'm working on in that moment. When I'm ready to zoom back out, I click back in the browser or click on a breadcrumb in the header section.
                        - Again, this feature seems so simple but the depth of it's power is incredible for organizing thought and facilitating focus.
                    - ### Inline Creation
                        - The third simple but super slick feature is that every time I put double brackets around a letter, word, or phrase (any string, for the developers out there) it automatically creates that page and all associated referenced and unreferenced links.
                        - This makes the page creation process stunningly fluid and seamless. Using Roam, the pace at which I can now think and create has accelerated by an order of magnitude with this one feature alone.
                        - An unexpected benefit of this conceptual asset is that creating pages feels very inexpensive. I can create pages willy nilly and never think twice about how many I have or maintaining them in any way. If I stumble on linking the same word or phrase again, I'll immediately see that this was already linked before and, because of the bi-directional linking, with a single click I'll be able to see where it came up before. And if I link something but never stumble on it again, well then it wasn't a particularly compelling thought because it only came up once never to resurface again.
                        - This feature empowers a gripping sense of flow state. When I am writing on a wiki or website and I want to create a new page to reference, I have to break my train of thought to pause, hit create for a new page, title it, add a URL slug, then go back and link it from the original source. And only then can I get back to writing or thinking again. In Roam, as I'm writing or note taking I simply highlight, add [[ ]] around that word or concept, and move on. Much faster, easier, and more intuitive.
                - The are many, many more awesome and thoughtful features to Roam, especially once you start adding community-built plugins like [Roam42](https://github.com/roamhacker/roam42), but these three features are what really delineate Roam from any other website, wiki, or note taking tool I've ever used before.
                - And now that I'm a true Believer, I completely understand what it means to be a "note-taking tool for networked thought". Roam is built on a graph database, which is a technical way of saying it's a mind map on steroids. Individual nodes in the network are linked to other nodes in the network, and as the quantity of links between any two nodes grows the strength of that link becomes stronger. For all you data nerds out there, think of "Roam is to mind map" as "SQL Server (or any enterprise grade relational database) is to spreadsheet".
                - Turns out, our brain's neural architecture also operates like a (hyper sophisticated) graph database -  we create memory nodes and then reinforce and strengthen connections through repetition and practice. I realized later that although Roam felt unintuitive at first, it actually felt more native and natural as I got versed in the mechanics. 
                    - The initial unintuitive discomfort arose because I was stepping out of the "known" paradigm of wikis, websites, and folder-based note taking apps like Evernote. The paradigm shift to graph-based thinking took me some time to grok, but once I got there I sensed a deep sigh of relief and release of tension. That's because I didn't have to force the square peg of my brain's native format (graph-based) into the circle hole of tabular and disconnected structures (folders, labels, wikis).
                    - Oh, and I also found I wasn't losing the "edges" of my cognition that get scraped off when I forced the square through the circle. In capturing all of the square, and many times over on multiple thoughts, I'm finding that my ideas fit together much more firmly and cleanly. And I can stack them atop each other to form a very robust structure of thought (that I could never achieve before with other note taking tools).
                - There is something oddly relieving to have a digital tool that feels so closely aligned with how my mind already works. And I think that's part of what contributes to the incredibly vocal, prolific, and obsessive community that's grown up around Roam that lovingly calls itself RoamCult. 
                - In the community, there is a general perception that we're at the tip of a monumental shift in how society interacts with information, and that's pretty darn exciting. For the first time in a long time, a piece of technology has fundamentally changed the way I think and create. And I'll go so far as to say Roam is also making me smarter, more organized, more productive, more integrous, more caring and thoughtful, and more handsome. OK, maybe not that last one (yet, but I have some ideas ...)
                - If you'd like to dig deeper into why Roam is so freaking awesome, start with [Nat Eliason's piece](https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam) and then scout [RoamBrain's intro roundup](https://www.roambrain.com/roam-intro/). If you're considering Nat's [Effortless Output](https://www.effortlessoutput.com/) course, it was well produced, well organized, and facilitated a quantum leap in my Roam skills. Worth every penny (and then some) in my book, but you can find all the content he offers scattered across Slack, Twitter, and blog posts from various sources (if money is less available than time and patience for sifting through the noise).
                - Nat's course quickly spun me up on best practices and core concepts of Roam, and after a month of active futzing I was starting to see the tremendous potential, but none of that course or the reading I did addressed the root causes of my cognitive constipation.
                - That's when I blissfully stumbled upon the Roam Book Club 2 where they were reading a book called "How to Take Smart Notes" that discusses a funky sounding Zettelkasten something or other. I'm generally skeptical of book (*ahem* intellectually shallow boozy) clubs, and I'm extra skeptical about a framing like "smart notes" (are my other notes dumb somehow?), but I was starting to drink the Roam kool aid so I originally joined to observe best practices from Roam power users. The community and power users have been awesome for sure, but I had no idea the book and its core concepts would completely steal the show for me. Simply put, my life and cognition are forever changed.
        - ## What is Zettelkasten? And why is it such a compelling PKM system?
            - __Key Transmission: Zettelkasten is about managing information flow to learn, synthesize, and publish through the act of writing inter-connected smart notes.__
                - So if Roam is a note taking tool, then what notes does one take? Roam founder [Conor White-Sullivan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cwhitesullivan/) has a beautiful line that Roam was built with a "low floor and high ceiling". That means you don't have to do much to get started, but you can perform unimaginable magic once you attain virtuosity. I was definitely stuck in the "don't do much" phase until the brilliant flash of serendipity that was Roam Book Club 2.
                - In that book club we read [[ðŸ“™ðŸ—³ How to Take Smart Notes]] by [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] which covers the pros, cons, and how tos of creating a zettelkasten information management system. 
                    - Zettelkasten was the system used by [[Niklas Luhmann]], a prolific and influential German sociologist in the latter 20th. The man wrote more than 70 books and almost 400 scholarly articles on a wide range of topics such as law, economy, politics, art, religion, ecology, mass media, and love. He was so successful and so well-regarded, people started studying his systems and workflows to understand his epic success.
                    - Ahrens dissects the individual steps of the process, the value baked in to each step, and how to implement this system for non-fiction writers. The overarching argument of the book is that the simple process of taking smart notes facilitates learning, insight, and producing quality publications.
                    - Ahrens also highlights the system as a conversation and accountability partner. A way to explore one's own thoughts and consciousness in a perfectly safe environment while continually edging the [[Zone of Proximal Development]].
                - The way zettelkasten achieves these wonders is through an emergent web of fleeting, literature, and permanent notes.
                    - The overarching flow for the Zettelkasten process is fleeting notes -> literature notes -> permanent notes
                        - First, read the text and take fleeting notes.
                            - Fleeting notes are whisps of awareness that are triggered by the text. These can span the spectrum from fledgling tickles of cognition to fully formed thoughts and arguments.
                                - The mechanics of fleeting notes depend on how you like to read and take notes.
                                    - If you prefer physical books or printing out articles and papers, most folks do one of the following
                                        - Highlight in line
                                        - Write in the margins
                                        - Use removable sticky tabs to mark key passages
                                        - Write ideas with pen and paper on the side
                                    - If you prefer digital books on kindle or iPad, most folks highlight and comment directly in the file. 
                                    - There are notable advantages and disadvantages to both physical and digital formats that I'll discuss below in the workflow section.
                            - Fleeting notes may or may not be related to the text proper. As long as they were triggered by the text, or while you were reading the text, they count. Either way, it's critical to notate the page and passage that triggered this thought.
                            - Fleeting notes sometimes include phrases like "this reminds me of ..." or "concept is similar to this other idea from ..." or "The idea of ... resonates with me because of ..."
                            - For example, here is a highlight I took from the book:
                                - The best way to maintain the feeling of being in control is to stay in control. And to stay in control, it's better to keep your options open during the writing process rather than limit yourself to your first idea. It is in the nature of writing, especially insight-oriented writing, that questions change, the material we work with turns out to be different from the one be er very imagined or that new ideas emerge, which might change our whole perspective on what we do. Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work. (PageÂ 16)
                            - And here are the fleeting notes I took on this passage:

                                - I like the visual that ideas are like butterfly or sprites that float on by. They hang out with me for just a little while, and if I don't engage them they flutter on over to the next recipient.
                                    - In that way, this system allows me to get the phone number of the butterfly or sprite so that, even if now isn't the right time, maybe we can hang out later when the time is right.
                                - Framed in the light of "keep your options open during the writing process" it really begs the question for how to pull more bottom-up thinking into children's education
                                - I really appreciate the phrase "insight-oriented writing" and the awareness that, by necessity, such writing is fluid in nature with increasing rigidity leading up to the moments right before publication.
                            - Notate (write, highlight, tab, comment) every meaningful fleeting note in your book or article.
                            - You know you're done with the fleeting note stage when you've finished the book or article and notated everything that caught your attention. This step is closest to how US students have been taught to read non-fiction for decades, so this step feels pretty straightforward and intuitive. Unfortunately, this is where most folks usually stop, but the Zettel train is just getting started
                        - After fleeting notes are complete, go back and write up your literature notes.
                            - Literature notes are atomic concepts (meaning one idea unit per literature note) that you paraphrase with a direct reference back to the original text.
                            - To continue the example from the passage above on page 16, here are my literature notes for that excerpt:
                                - Insight-oriented writing is inherently fluid in that awareness shifts as one learns, understands, and thinks more.
                                - A system that is flexible enough to allow for adjustments to realign interest, motivation, and productivity will bring us closer to flow state.
                            - Notice how I broke out 2 literature notes for that section. I did so because each concept felt distinct so, in the spirit of atomic thoughts, I delineated the two.
                            - It's critical for the literature note phase that you do not project yourself or add any of your own thoughts or ideas onto the text. You are simply restating, in your own words, the section of text that caught your attention.
                            - This paraphrasing, or as Ahrens calls it "translation," is very important for facilitating deeper understanding and improved recall.
                            - From grade school through Ivy League undergraduate, I've never done this type of "translating," so this step definitely felt awkward and clunky to me at first. By the end of working through my highlights, even as a complete newbie and beginner, the flow felt much more natural and intuitive to me. Plus, I walked away with a much deeper understanding of the text and the wisdom it offers its readers.
                            - You know you're done with the literature note phase when every passage you highlighted or commented on (that is worth summarizing) is transmuted into your own words.
                        - Finally, write your permanent notes (I like to call them zettels because that sounds fun)
                            - Zettels are declarative statements that make an assertion related to, but not bound by, the literature and fleeting notes.
                            - Structurally, imagine a zettel as a three-legged stool - the original text, fleeting notes, and literature notes are the three legs of the stool and the zettel is what you can stand on to see further in your intellectual landscape. Later, I'll show you how to stack these zettels so you can keep climbing hiring in your own consciousness.
                            - Procedurally, to create a zettel, reread your highlight and its associated fleeting and literature notes, and then think about what that means to you. How does that fit into the larger narrative that you're developing? Does that support other thoughts you've had or evidence you've found on that topic? Does it contract past ideas?
                            - To round out the example above from Page 16, here is my zettel for that passage
                                - Insight-oriented writing requires system flexibility and fluidity to keep options open and to enter flow state. Rich, interconnected insights are more likely with bottom-up idea generation.
                            - This step was by far and away the least intuitive of the three and the least well described in the book. I really struggled with this concept and spent the vast majority of my time stumbling through this process. 
                            - This is where the Roam Book Club was so valuable for me - I could see how other people were doing zettels and I also got extensive coaching from a bright light and mind named [[Beau Haan]].
                            - The extreme difficulty I felt in this step is the precise reason I wanted to do this write up to show you how it works in action.
                - Each step of the zettelkasten process has compelling and ingenious value
                    - Fleeting notes feel deeply honoring and relieving to my intellectual body
                        - If a thought or wisp of attention crosses my mind, I write it down. In this way, I honor that every thought has value and is worth documenting in that moment. Sometimes when I go back and reread a fleeting note in the literature note phase I realize that thought wasn't so meaningful and I can peacefully throw away that fleeting note. But the fact that I took the time to write it down, and then think about it later, means that I am *always* capturing *every* meaningful thought. That is tremendously powerful for the compound interest of investing into my zettelkasten - the more I do this, the more new terrain I'll explore in the vast and diverse landscape of my consciousness.
                        - Once I am done with the fleeting note stage, I feel a deep sense of relief for having closed every open loop (to borrow David Allen's term) or niddly thought (to offer my own). That's it - I've written it all down. There is nothing I did not capture. I have never before felt the depth of completeness with a book like when I closed the final page after doing my last fleeting note.
                    - Literature notes require diligent reading and translation facilitates understanding
                        - Throughout the literature note process, I was shocked at how often I would project myself onto the text. I'd write a summary note, then go back and reread the original passage, and realize that half or more of my "summary" was nowhere to be found in that passage. Ahrens writes extensively about the cognitive biases that zettelkasten alleviates, but this one was genuinely surprising to me. I did not realize how much I was hijacking the intellectual honesty of a text's content by overlaying my own worldview or intellectual agenda.
                        - Practicing the skill to delineate my own declarative thoughts (zettels) from what is actually written in the book is hugely beneficial for understanding. In a number of literature notes, once I wiped clean my own overlay, I found that the text was actually pointing in a slightly different direction which unlocked new thoughts and insights. I have absolutely zero doubt that I understand the text on a much more intimate level because I took the time to paraphrase the key passages that stood out to me.
                    - Zettels distill core concepts and refine insights in the context of my own worldview
                        - Finally, taking the time to map the ideas found in the book to my own intellectual landscape feels like activating a nascent superpower. Every zettel I write is, by definition, written in the context of every other zettel I've curated from every other text I've written related to that subject. That means that disparate ideas from arenas I would have never correlated suddenly stand in stark clarity side by side. And I can immediately see if those concepts line up and support each other, or if in fact I need to further refine my awareness because I am holding two contradictory thoughts without any resolution.
                        - This is where the concept of "dialogue partner" and "accountability partner" come into play. As my zettelkasten gets deeper in certain areas of thought, a worldview naturally emerges from the bottom-up. Inevitably, I am pleasantly (or unpleasantly) surprised by what I think on a topic, and now I am having an active conversation with myself. Can I really declare that assertion with so much confidence? Is that a fair or honest statement to make? The cool part is, if I ever want to know how I got there, I have the entire breadcrumb trail back through literature notes, fleeting notes, and original text that I can follow. As I get more dialed and refined in a certain arena, I may go back and refine some ideas with greater context from more reading. 
                        - And, to paraphrase Ahrens, when I see two contradictory ideas side by side then it's extra exciting because it means I can iron out a wrinkle in my matrix. Because the zettelkasten constantly resurfaces information I would have otherwise forgotten exactly when it's relevant for a given thought process, it does not allow me to pick and choose the evidence that is convenient in that moment. I have to honor it all, and in doing so, I build a much more complete, coherent, and consistent perspective on any given topic.
                    - One overarching benefit of the zettelkasten process is that it is content agnostic and grows organically
                        - It does not matter if you care about architecture, spirituality, dental hygiene, or anything else - as long as you're taking smart notes the zettelkasten will support your growth in awareness at every step of your journey.
                        - It's also meaningful that I don't have to "pick a topic" and research the crap out of it. Instead, I simply pick up whatever interests me, zettel that text, and then move on. As I get more and more texts under my belt, without ever taking a directive approach, patterns will begin to emerge on the domains and disciplines that interest me most. And I never have to force it - if I don't feel like reading about topic X for a whole year, all my zettels will be patiently waiting for me when my interest veers back in that direction. And if it never does, then there is no harm and I can peacefully continue focusing on whatever interests me most in that moment.
                        - As a critical mass of insights arise, especially when I observe a narrative that I have not read elsewhere, it naturally become meaningful to distill those thoughts into a written form focused on publication. And what joy and ease to have the outline pre-baked for me! I've got the big declarative ideas (zettels) coupled with their evidence (literature notes) across a variety of texts complete with their relationships. Now it's as simple as organizing the flow of the narrative and pouring in the interstitial fluid to hold it all together.
                    - The absolute most compelling aspect to me is the concept of a dialogue and accountability partner.
                        - I miss the intellectual stimulation of being in a collegiate environment.
                            - In my current social circles, it is relatively rare to dive deep into thoughtful, heavily researched and well-cited primary research conversations on marquee topics that interest me like philosophy, ecology, education, medicine, productivity, business, spirituality, diversity, architecture, musical composition, poetry and many more.
                            - And in the rare instances that such conversations do arise, it is extra rare for someone to have the awareness or the gumption to call me out when I formulate incomplete thoughts or arguments riddled with logical fallacies and counter examples.
                        - No one will be more blunt about challenging my core beliefs than I. Better I poke holes in my own consciousness and awareness before anyone else finds them.
                - Because the zettelkasten is such a complete and exhaustive exercise, when I am done zetteling a book, I feel totally complete with that book. I have extracted every possible nutrient from the text that resonates with my worldview and fed those nutrients to grow my intellectual garden. 
                - At the end of finishing a text, I feel a deep sense of calm and completeness that I've never felt when reading before. Having released everything from my mind into my zettelkasten, I am again an empty vessel ready to take on the next text with pristine clarity and focus. Now I look at my stack of books and articles with genuine enthusiasm and excitement - the only question becomes how I can optimize my zettel flow. The faster I zettel, the faster I can grow my intellectual forest, and that's exactly where Roam comes in.
        - ## Why implement Zettelkasten in Roam? What is won or lost with this implementation?
            - __Key Transmission: Roam, implemented wisely, can make creating, exploring, and refining a Zettelkasten substantially more efficient.__
                - Luhmann, working before computers became prolific, built his zettelkasten on notecards with a complex system of coded cross-relations. I appreciate the value of the forced constraint of the notecard, but such a physical system would be a non-starter for me. 
                    - First, I don't have the space in my home to house a large card filing cabinet. 
                    - Second, I find the note referencing system to be confusing, exhausting, and overwhelming.
                    - Third, I travel often and would not be able to carry my entire zettelkasten with me everywhere I go.
                    - Fourth, I type much faster than I write. Although this opens the potential of not being concise, I can practice being concise while still utilizing the order of magnitude uptick in speed I win on a keyboard.
                - If I didn't know better, I'd say Roam was custom-built to be a perfect tool just for zetteling. It's not, of course, but it sure feels that way.
                    - The bi-directional linking means I can navigate my zettelkasten horizontally (across topics) and vertically (up and down the text -> fleeting -> literature -> zettel structure) with lightning speed.
                    - Blocks, block hierarchies, and block references are a quantum leap from Luhmann's original branching and index notes because they add a third (and fourth) dimension of relation.
                        - Luhmann had a "flat" or 2D data architecture because his cards where all stacked horizontally in his card cabinet. If he wanted to branch to another concept, he had to make a note to "link" to the other cabinet drawer, and then the cards were again stacked one behind the other. The best he could do was put one card behind another to suggest some hierarchy, but that breaks quickly if one card branches into two concepts.
                        - In Roam, I can have a 3D (or 4D?) hierarchy, plus some spooky action at a distance with all the block referencing. Specifically, if concept A branches into supporting evidence A1 and A2 then those can be two child blocks below A. And if A1 has some contradicting evidence, I can nest that under A1. And if that evidence is related to concept D7 somewhere else, I can reference that block and always see where and how it's referenced across my zettelkasten with a simple glance. Then if I care to dig into the references, I'm always one click away from exactly where I need to go.
                        - I personally don't like taking my fleeting and literature notes in Roam's daily notes section, but [[Beau Haan]] is all about it because he likes to see the date and timestamp for when certain ideas came to him. I don't care as much about the time graph concept for my zetteling, but the fact that this is available to those who care about that is extra cool and all it requires is a trivial change in your workflow. Just take your notes on a day's page (instead of, as in my case, a book's page) and your zettelkasten time graph is instantly unlocked by default.
                    - Inline creation makes the process of creating and cross referencing notes at every level extremely easy. On top of that, the ability to pull up my book notes in the primary screen side-by-side with my zettelkasten "dialogue" page is tremendous as I can see the big picture at the exact same time that I'm coloring in the edges with new zettels. This visual ease of access creates a much more fluid and seamless thinking, writing, and creating flow state.
                    - Also, because storage is free and frictionless, I can actually include my source text in line with my fleeting, literature, and zettel notes. This is huge! Luhmann had to maintain a separate bookshelf of all of his primary materials and pulling the original text must have been a pain. In Roam, the original text is always just one click away.
                        - Procedurally, Roam's integration with Readwise means I have a simple and automated inbound pipeline of books and articles that instantly plop in my zettel inbox. Even though I prefer reading physical books, I still have a way to get everything into Roam much faster than retyping by hand. 
                - I'll be the first to admit that Roam's "low floor" means that folks could miss a lot of these benefits by implementing a suboptimal Roamkasten. Next I'll dive into the meat of the mechanics of setting up your own optimized Roamkasten.
        - ## Mechanics, templates, and design decisions for an optimized Roamkasten
            - __Key Transmission: The way to optimize a Zettelkasten in Roam is with a series of simple, but notably powerful, workflows, conventions and design decisions.__
                - There are 3 global steps to Roamkasten:
                    - Ingest - getting primary source materials & highlights into Roam
                    - Digest - working through fleeting -> literature -> zettel notes flow
                    - Egest - organizing insights into publications and pushing back out into the world
                        - Strictly speaking, the third step is not necessary if you never seek to publish. Even if you're not an academic, I believe there is tremendous value to putting your thoughts and insights into the public sphere, but there is no express need for that step to ever come to fruition. You'll still get all the benefits of learning, understanding, dialogue and accountability if you just focus on steps 1 and 2.
                - ### Ingest
                    - I'm a total weirdo and I can't stand highlighting or writing in my books. So I used a series of sticky tabs and post it notes to take my highlights and fleeting notes.
                        - I had 4 colors of stickies that I used:
                            - Green = meaningful concept that I agree with and want to convert into a literature note
                            - Purple = awesome quote that I want to lift verbatim and hold on to
                            - Pink = disagree with this idea
                            - Orange = primary source I want to flag to review myself later
                        - I also had a series of post its where I wrote down my fleeting notes
                        - When I was done, my book looked like this:
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FFmjO-SvCK5.jpg?alt=media&token=66e0fdd7-a271-4cfd-a5a6-71a01c33076a)
                        - For what it's worth, the reason I don't like altering my books is that I don't want to bias myself or any future reader that I may lend the book to. I find it distracting to see other people's notes, especially when they are non-sensical to me, and I don't want to burden any future readers in that way. Plus, I love seeing a book with worn binding that I know has been well read and loved but never knowing what the readers thought about that book. Feels more free and inspiring to form my own opinions and more honoring of the author to let their work stand in isolation of my own overlay.
                    - Then to get my "highlights" (read: tab notations) into Roam I use [Readwise](https://readwise.io/)
                        - The Readwise iOS app has an OCR function where I took a picture of each page with a tab and notated C (for concept, green tab), Q (for quote, purple tab), D (for disagree, pink tab), and R (for research, orange tab) in the note section and the page number. As I captured each tab, I removed the tab so by the end the book was clean again.
                            - I admit this was a bit clunky and took extra time. I really prefer physical books, so this may be worth it, but I also bought a Kindle to see if I could get used to that flow because it truly does save a chunk of time to highlight inline without taking pictures later.
                            - If I do choose to stick with physical books, I'll build a small jig for my iPad mini so I can speed up the picture / OCR workflow.
                        - If you prefer Kindle, the flow for reading, highlighting, and importing via Readwise is much more seamless
                        - Outside of books, Readwise has a number of other useful integrations
                            - For articles online, I use [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) and sync via Readwise
                            - I haven't gotten beyond articles and books myself yet, but Readwise has many more integrations and they are actively building out their platform. It has quickly become the single point of entry for all external material that I don't copy-paste directly into Roam.
                    - Inside Readwise when you set up the export to Roam you can bake in some metadata to make things really easy downstream. The metadata I use is a very slightly modified version from Nat's Effortless Output course (seriously, it's worth the money, so go take it)
                        - ```html
Author:: [[{{author}}]]
Full Title:: {{full_title}}

                        - And the sample of what it looks like is:
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FM3V01W1mQh.png?alt=media&token=d812a792-157d-4614-a67c-8aa3f97a91c8)
                        - Nifty, right?!
                - ### Digest
                    - Once I have all my highlights in Roam on my book page, the real fun begins.
                    - Since I read the physical book, I had a series of fleeting notes on post it notes. Above my "Highlights" section I created a "Notes" section where I typed up all my fleeting notes. 
                        - I'm not convinced that every fleeting note must be bound to a given page or passage, so I like to break out a separate section for my notes and reference back to the source material block.
                    - Once all my fleeting notes were fully documented in Roam, I took a few days of break to gain space and perspective. Ahrens writes about how the discrete tasks of the Zettelkasten process offers an easy place to take a break, and how valuable those breaks can be for learning and understanding. I can speak to the value of these breaks first hand through this experience.
                    - After all my fleeting notes were entered, then I went back through each of my C or green tab highlights and parsed them into literature notes.
                        - Each literature note by definition must reference a primary source text, so I include the page number as a linked reference back to the highlight block
                        - I align any fleeting notes that came from that passage with the literature notes from that passage to keep things linear and tidy
                        - As I reread the highlight and drafted my literature note, I also fleshed out my fleeting notes with any other thoughts or concepts that came up on my second pass.
                        - Once I was done, it looked something like this:
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2F0KYqfPnzMu.png?alt=media&token=de8b7534-c0a6-40e0-a796-de6b0341060a)
                        - The cute formatting for the literature and fleeting note tags is just CSS that was created by [[Beau Haan]] for the Roam Book Club. I think it's beautiful and adds visual spice, so I ported it over to my personal Roam graph. If you like the CSS, I've pasted it in the addendum section and make sure to give Beau a big shout out on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/beauhaan)
                    - Even though I'd been through the book multiple times now ( 1) read book & tab, 2) ingest via Readwise OCR, 3) type up fleeting notes, 4) write literature notes ), somehow I was still finding more insight and more refinement of the concepts! And again, after the literature notes phase I took a break to gain some space and perspective.
                    - Next, I sat down to write my zettels
                        - I reread the source text (to validate I was honestly translating my literature notes), my fleeting notes, and my literature notes, and then I thought about why I care about that passage at all. Why did I notate it? Where does it fit in my worldview? What does it support or contradict? What ideas does it flesh out? Or is it a new idea altogether that offers a new branch in the ever growing forest of my consciousness?
                        - Structurally, my Zettels are a parent block with 3 children blocks
                            - Related topics - my tags for resurfacing later
                            - Literature notes that support the Zettel
                            - Fleeting notes related to that Zettel
                            - Looks like this:
![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FaVnTHDW-o9.png?alt=media&token=24e3f158-7ea6-448d-902a-fb1935aab60b)
                        - Structuring the Zettels in this format has a significant advantage for discovery and review downstream. Specifically, when I open that Zettel in the sidebar, I can see all of the supporting pieces in 1 quick glance
                            - ![](https://cdn.loom.com/sessions/thumbnails/c56ffa3f3cee4dcba9e1e7a5c5036fac-with-play.gif)
                            - And when I reference that Zettel in more places, I'll quickly see every location right away.
                    - Again, after my zettel round I took a break to gain some space and perspective. It feels FANTASTIC that I can quietly walk away from this book multiple times always to come back with greater clarity and precision in what I'm extracting.
                    - Finally, and to me this is the most exciting step, I figure out where each Zettel fits in my larger dialogue. 
                        - Because [[ðŸ“™ðŸ—³ How to Take Smart Notes]] is the crystallization seed of [[Mein Zettel]], I started with a blank page. Of course, that'll never be true again moving forward.
                        - First, I thought about the big picture concepts I care about and how they show up in the book. For me, that was learning (which includes writing), awareness, and productivity.
                            - For each arena, I wrote a strong declarative statement that I wish to flesh out, validate, refine, or completely refute throughout my Zettelkasten dialogue.
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2F-5fUkRHXVG.png?alt=media&token=9ce65b21-6a4c-438b-aba4-cdde65c7e65a)
                        - Then, I ran through all of my zettels from my book page and dropped them into each larger branch of thought.
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FaCND6adEg_.png?alt=media&token=faa5b764-45ac-41c6-b3e1-ccfab18a06b7)
                            - This step was especially interesting because when I first wrote my zettels in a vacuum I did not have a sense of how they would relate. Now, with the clarity of the hierarchy, I can start to see emerging patterns and larger narratives.
                            - Per [[Beau Haan]]'s recommendation, I included a 1 or 2 word "thumbnail" as a tag at the beginning of each zettel. This helps underscore what's in the content of that zettel as I'm scrolling through quickly and absolutely added to the efficiency of this process for me with just 1 book in my Roamkasten. I can only imagine the exponential value of this as I start to have hundreds or thousands of zettels
                            - Side by side with my book notes it looked like this:
                                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2Fw5lHRPFhFl.png?alt=media&token=0485ac4f-f787-4bb6-8a19-c88bc9991fd7)
                        - Finally, I went back to my book page and organized my zettels into Relevant Notes. Each Relevant Note is effectively a theme in the book.
                            - Just to see what happens, I organized my book page's Relevant Notes independently of looking at Mein Zettel. Naturally there was some overlap, but I was somewhat surprised to see that prevalent themes in the book (like writing and systems) were subsumed into larger narratives within my dialogue (writing under learning and systems sprinkled throughout learning and productivity, respectively).
                                - I think this is a pristine example of the value of having a centralized dialogue space as distinct from permanent notes on a book proper. Although the themes are strong enough to be called out independently from the book, the key points there serve as interstitial fluid for my intellectual body elsewhere.
                                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2F_jFS5dlARL.png?alt=media&token=88b4026b-9246-41c8-93bf-58167ae50327)
                            - After setting up the relevant notes, I dropped each of my notes where I thought it felt most natural.
                                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FjQ-NnMPhMH.png?alt=media&token=1acb7b2a-6c72-43de-9484-c5550a371a41)
                            - As the absolute last step, I went back through Mein Zettel and saw what zettels felt like they could be referenced within each of the larger relevant note themes and dropped them in as block refs.
                                - Of course, because I only have 1 item in Mein Zettel for now, I was referencing other blocks from within this text. As I start feeding more and more literature into my dialogue, I'll be able to quickly and dynamically pull core ideas from other texts into the thought process for the current text.
                                    - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2Flq9j-C_x8r.png?alt=media&token=6dd2329d-64a2-4d06-839b-ba7f3f5998f2)
                                - This exercise is EXACTLY the act of resurfacing, expanding, and connecting that Ahrens writes about in his book. I absolutely walked away from this process feeling like I understood the core concepts and how they mapped to my worldview in a pristine way. And I have no doubt that I learned more, understood more deeply, and felt way more prepared to write this article (and all future articles referencing anything from book) than I would have if I just read the book and highlighted a few sentences here and there never to look at them again.
                - ### Egest
                    - Writing has never been my profession or my focus, and strictly speaking one doesn't need to ever write or publish to deeply cherish the value of a zettelkasten. 
                        - Even if I cared to write, I did not feel like I had anything worthwhile or of value to share. 
                            - With bottom-up ideas, I realized that this really takes the pressure off of "knowing what to write". If some meaningful insight arises from this practice, and I know it's meaningful because I've done the research and took smart notes, then I would feel confident writing and publishing. If nothing of interest arises, then so be it and I know for a fact that I should not bother with publishing half-baked concepts or ideas.
                        - A few weeks later I read [[Nat Eliason]]'s post on starting a life-changing blog (link) and it further reinforced my desire to start a personal blog. Starting with the backbone of Roamkasten, I can construct a structurally sound and healthy functioning body of knowledge.
                        - So now I have a means and a motive to write! And this article is the very first example of that.
                    - Once I have enough insights to draw upon to add something valuable to our collective consciousness, I organize my thoughts into a more linear format like this article.
                    - When I first open an article page, I give it a title and drop in the following metadata
                        - Target publication date (so I can work backwards on writing and editing)
                        - Tags (so I can cross reference articles written in similar domains)
                        - Status (for querying within Roam elsewhere)
                        - Google doc (for the flatter version and formatting before porting to my site)
                        - Reference materials (for quick shift-click to open references in the sidebar)
                        - During writing, the article page looked like this:
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FzX4VQ25MV9.png?alt=media&token=0884145f-93a8-48da-b0da-3064843733a5)
                    - I also include a section for Outline and Cutting Floor
                        - In the Outline, I start by breaking out the big picture structure of the article like so
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FbGjOC_1a48.png?alt=media&token=2b302f81-d23c-4e29-9f6a-3c2c4b621344)
                        - Then I flesh out each section header with a 1 sentence summary. If I can't distill the entire section to 1 sentence, then I'm not clear enough on what I'm saying or I need to break it out into multiple sections.
                            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FrZYsSbVcSY.png?alt=media&token=edf3de66-55b5-4289-aea5-37a4b805f5ff)
                        - Once I have the summaries, I go back and start fleshing them out. I peruse my Roamkasten notes as well as other related notes and topics sprinkled across my Roam. I usually keep my writing text in the main screen and use the sidebar on the right for all my referencing need.
                        - I usually write over the course of multiple days and weeks, and every time I sit down to write I start by re-reading what I wrote before. Anything that seems superfluous I drop to the cutting floor section. Somehow, not deleting makes it much easier for me to feel calm slicing and dicing with a vengeance. Ahrens talks about "killing your darlings" - that's a touch violent for my flavor but I appreciate the point to remove everything that isn't necessary until only the core nuggets are left.
                            - I think the cutting floor works because I've convinced myself that I'm not losing anything - it's always there for me to pick back up in case I think it works somewhere else. In truth, I never touch 99% of what I makes it to the cutting floor, but the concept does enable me to cut without reservation or thinking twice.
                    - Once I have my logical backbone (the outline) and put some meat on those bones (the nested block writing in Roam) I then transfer all that to Google Docs and refine it into a flatter, more "normal" writing style that works for posting on my site. By the time my content lands in Google Docs, I'm about 90% done with the process and it's just editing and refinement from there.
        - ## Elements I added on top of strict Roamkasten workflows to tailor to me
            - __Key Transmission: I find tremendous value in the Roamkasten method, but it felt slightly incomplete to me. I found myself craving a simple summary, action items, research triggers, and a quote collection.__
            - It's hard for me to overstate how monumental the discovery of Roamkasten has been for me. I sense a tsunami swell of curiosity, drive, and ambition knowing that I now have a PKM that conclusively cures, once and for all, my cognitive constipation. I can now run hard, and think harder, with no hesitation and reservation.
            - And yet, when I finished zetteling the Smart Notes book I still felt incomplete. The pieces I found I was missing were Quick Summary, Action Items, Research Triggers, Random Thoughts, and Quote Collection.
                - **Quick Summary** is just that, a few sentence summary that draws the big picture overview of what this text covers. The pull for me here is for sharing my book notes with others as well as looking back at a book page many years in the future.
                    - I enjoy writing haikus, so I also include a quick summary haiku that's more abstract but captures the ethos and feel state I experience from the text.
                    - For Ahren's book, my summary is
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FuR-WsNcqBh.png?alt=media&token=58bb97a6-0c27-4143-bfa1-08c5256a042e)
                - **Action Items** are specific elements that I need to change in my life as a function of what I've learned
                    - Of course, my absolute top action item was to start zetteling immediately. Mission accomplished thanks to Roam Book Club!!
                    - The other action items are active tasks or writing ideas for the future
                    - Here is what my action items look like. Note: I did not throw the first task into my Inbox and tag it because I'm already doing it
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FzNX-0dMeos.png?alt=media&token=a5af3914-1b94-4ec4-a5c4-642e0523f6b3)
                - **Research Triggers** are questions that came up throughout reading the book or primary sources that I want to delve deeper into.
                    - I tend to reference these back to the highlight that triggered this thought, whenever possible. And if it was not triggered by anything, I just drop it in rough chronological order of when that question arose within the book.
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FCRwH_LZU7S.png?alt=media&token=f6218c6f-bbd5-4cd1-95eb-25a9ce821740)
                - **Random Thoughts** are not fleeting notes, literature notes, or zettels. They may not even be related to the book at all, but they came up while I was reading the book. I want them contextualized within the book page, and I want to document them so I don't lose the concepts, but there was no where else to put them.
                    - Here is what my random thoughts look like, collapsed to the top child level
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2FzmU8Z23Syu.png?alt=media&token=b8497d5b-b7eb-4768-8d51-a730324d73d4)
                - **Quote Collection** are direct lines from the book that I can imagine repeating in future writing. These are gems that I'll want to quote again and again in the future
                    - I'm not sure when I'll use these, but they're too good to get lost in the shuffle of my direct highlights
                        - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2FInstitute-of-Self-Actualization%2F7Bmm_EKp_-.png?alt=media&token=d1bb80f1-1df0-45f5-8df0-783fb794ae0d)
            - Once I had each of those sections filled out, I felt absolutely and fully complete with this book.
                - Every ounce of insight that's relevant for my larger dialogue has been extracted (notes)
                - I can easily share my book notes with others (quick summary + organization of relevant notes)
                - I know what I'm supposed to do (action items)
                - I know where I learn from here (research triggers)
                - I have arrows in my quiver for sounding smart (quote collection)
                - I have captured everything that doesn't fit anywhere else (random thoughts)
            - Now, I can peacefully put this book back on my shelf (or lend it to my friends and family since I keep raving about Roamkasten and they are getting curious about why I dove so deep into this system like nothing before). My overall feel state sensation is that of an empty vessel and empty mind, fully and completely ready for whatever I choose to digest and zettel next.
        - ## My outstanding Roamkasten questions and unknowns
            - __Key Transmission: Although I've figured out a lot, and feel really good about where I'm at, there are still plenty more questions I have yet to explore.__
                - I'm still early in the Roamkasten process and I'm sure I'll dial in both the workflow and the concepts over time. A couple of larger questions that I'm curious to explore in the future:
                    - How do I go back and refine zettels over time?
                        - As my thoughts and ideas refine, what do I do with old zettels that no longer fit? Or have been debunked? Or are mostly there, but need to be tweaked to get closer to my current concept of truth?
                        - I genuinely have no idea how this will work, though I know some folks who likely do and are eager to help out in the process.
                    - How can I make zetteling more approachable and accessible to more people?
                        - I sense tremendous value for individuals that zettel in the realm of sense-making.
                        - I want more people to be better at intelligent sense-making in this world.
                        - I know I am capable of being an entry point for this system for otherwise untouched populations.
                        - What is the most streamlined approach that feels most intuitive and accessible for other people to start zetteling on their own?
                            - I have my first test subject! Just today my wife said that, after seeing my process, she wants to start her Roamkasten as well.
                                - Beautifully, her lens on reality is starkly different from my own. So it will be wonderful to see the "content agnostic" quality of Roamkasten in play in my own household across our own personal graphs!
                    - Given that zetteling is a quantum leap in learning and understanding, how can we adapt this process to younger audiences and incorporate into their educational process?
                        - We'll likely homeschool our kids (none yet, but soon) so we have flexibility to try out new educational models with them
                        - I firmly believe zetteling has tremendous compound interest over time. If that's the case, and Luhmann only started in his 30s, what would happen if we gave a smart human a 30 year head start on Luhmann's insane productivity? Just wow.
                    - Is Zettelkasten restricted to written medium? How would I implement for the creative arts like music, dance, or sculpture?
                        - I suspect there is a way, and I very much intend to figure it out.
                    - What are the developmental inflection points in a Roamkasten?
                        - I understand Luhmann had to reboot his Zettelkasten at least once, and was also constantly refining it on a daily basis.
                            - What triggered his big reboot? Are there elements in Roam that make that much easier to stomach?
                            - What other triggers will require tectonic shifts in Mein Zettel above and beyond the standard refinements over time (that I also don't yet know how to do. Ha!)
                - Thankfully, none of this intimidates or scares me because, well, I have Roamkasten. If ever I have a thought or question I want to diligently explore, I know exactly how I'm going to do it and that it will yield tremendous value and unforeseeable emergent insights far in the future. Heck ya!

        - Learning best practices for how to read books / consume other media and take notes proactively within Roam
        - Figure out how to take those notes and convert them into meaningful content to share in multiple formats

    - "Reflection on first reading phase of the book "
        - "What ideas resonate with you from the book"
            - That this system has exponential network effects
            - That this system names a lot of the challenges and frustrations that I've felt in previous knowledge management attempts
            - That this system codifies a series of positive attributes into a virtuous cycle of knowledge
            - The idea of "having a conversation" with a "second brain". Almost like a playful and richly meaningful game of chess against yourself
            - That the system is simple but not easy
        - "What is the gist of the book? " 
            - The gist is smart notes are a critical function for better (faster, stronger, more creative, more constructive) thinking, learning, and writing
        - "Discuss the fleeting note phase"
            - "What does the concept of fleeting notes mean to you? "
                - Anything that catches my attention for any reason, and what thought or awareness came to mind in that moment
            - "Define a fleeting note in your own words. " 
                - A fleeting note is writing down an awareness that arose from a specific stimulus in a specific context.
            - "How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method."
                - Color coded tabs for different textual-based elements

                        - Read this reference
                        - I like and agree with this general idea
                        - I do not agree or like this idea
                        - Quotable moment
                - Pen and sticky note for random ideas that may or may not be related to the text in any way whatsoever
            - "What is the value of fleeting notes?  For this book, and for previous books you have read? " 
                - Minimize psychic weight down to zero. The stillness is "breath-giving"
                - Validate the thought immediately by giving it the weight of ink or tab
                - Never sure if a random thought could be fantastic. Increase odds by simply increasing the shots we take.
                - Some of the greatest brilliance comes at the intersection of various fields and in the subconscious mind. Catching what's in between is the most delicate, and most fertile, of intellectual activities.

    - What struggles have you had implementing literature notes? [*](((SIN62h-E3)))
        - Part of my struggle with taking literature notes is that I have a strong preference for reading physical books, so it was a non-trivial effort to port my literature notes into Roam
            - For literature notes, I have difference color tabs that I place throughout the book to highlight quotes, concept, disagreements, and a desire to dig deeper into a reference
        - Ultimately, I ended up using the Readwise app on iOS to take pictures and OCR the text into Roam. This requires a lot of manual steps:
            - Turning to the page
            - Taking a picture in the app (sometimes multiple times if the OCR doesn't catch right)
            - Highlighting the desired text
            - Add my comment
            - Save
        - I have a VERY STRONG preference for physical books, but this may prove to be a high barrier to entry for note taking. I've also purchased a Kindle to see if I can streamline this workflow without losing too much on the physical experience of reading
            - It may be that certain lighter (or maybe heavier?) books I can digest in Kindle, but there are some tomes that really require the physical aspect
            - It may also be that the physical act of writing and transporting is "healthy friction" that induces greater thought and learning. I did have to think back to each of my tab placements and understand why I put them there and what they mean to me. 
                - There were a few, maybe 5 out of 100, that I changed as I imported. The vast majority I still agreed with and kept as is.
            - Generally, trying to get away from so much screen time.
        - One idea that could make this better is to set up a jig with my tech so that I can more easily scan through a book using the Readwise book import tek
            - I do like that this import automatically pulls in the book cover!
    - Describe any enlightening moments you had while taking literature notes. [*](((FWJ5P3PcV)))
        - One of the most A HA! moments that I had relates to the experience of atomizing the tasks of smart notes
            - It felt really good and complete to read through the book taking any random fleeting note on a notepad and my first step of literature notes with my tabs. There was an incredible sense of completion when I got to the end.
            - It felt equally good to go through and port all of my literature notes into Roam. When I removed my last tab and closed the book, there was such a rewarding sigh of completion.
            - When I actually document my thoughts around each of these literature notes I expect there will be a similar sense of completion.
            - And when I finally write up the permanent notes then I imagine the completeness will be profound
        - I am so amazed at how much this technique minimizes the sensation of cognitive loss
            - Usually, there is some decay on retention whenever I read a book or article I find compelling. It's a known entity and it sucks, but it's just part of being human with limited retention space.
            - With zettles, that limitation is reduced to zero and it's SO!! empowering to know that I can fully and completely digest a given text, then the next one, and so on until my orbweaver of mental lattices builds the one web of knowledge to rule them all
        - In smaller bites, I've already experienced this with taking smart notes on articles and web essays that I've been digesting since reading the Smart Notes book
        - To me, this underscores the BIG difference between casually reading and fully digesting and internalizing a piece of knowledge or awareness. I sense a great deal of power, and delight, in the serenity of knowing that every piece of information I consume moving forward will be fully and completely digested into the larger zeitgeist of my zettlekasten and, ultimately, my one coherent mental model

        - Fleeting notes vs. Literature notes
            - Henry's take: Fleeting note is a wisp of awareness not necessarily tied to the book but worth capturing. Literature note is an awareness that's tied to a specific textual reference.
            - Adrian's take: Read online and use Readwise to highlight, then progressively highlight, and then permanent note is a new page with many references to many texts
            - Henry mentioned Nat Eliason's [Effortless Output text](https://www.effortlessoutput.com/)
            - How to read a book
            - Adil's take: Hi guys, i experience something familiar, both types - some books i read, highlight and import highlights into roam through readwise; some others i just have the physical book. Recently iá¸¿ trying different reading-noting modes trying to explore the concepts of Sonkes Book. Makes sense to me that fleeting notes on paper from printed books makes more sense than the virtual and automatic synchronizations by readwise, where I tend to jump from reading to marking core concepts and start taking literature notes immediately. The digestion from the first case - physical books - seems much more slow and rich in the end for exploring in a slow pace the book im readingâ€©(sorry by typing, not a native english speaker)
            - Adrian: Do I take notes while I'm reading? Or just take highlights and take notes once it's in Roam?
                - Often it's not practically easy to have a notebook in one hand and a pen and paper in the other
                - Typically just highlight, and then second stage is to take notes on highlights. Not preferred, but most practical
            - Art: Is it output or process? It needs to be enjoyable, fun, and scalable over time. Needs to bring into a flow state
                - Spectrum of value. People will work with process to match their value set.

- [[Live Session 4]] on [[November 22nd, 2020]]
    - "Reflect on the book.  What are you impressions? "
        - This is a wonderfully well reasoned and presented take on why smart notes are just a good idea for anyone who cares to curate knowledge or engage in thoughtful self discovery
        - This book is the crystallization seed of a life-long project and I will write a letter of gratitude to [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] for his impact on my life
    - "Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way? "
        - Tremendously useful, but I don't think they helped me understand the book in a different way. Instead, the act of writing down my ideas around each quote facilitated a sharper understanding of what exactly stood out to me from that passage, concept, or quote.
        - I also tagged every primary research I want to review later and already have a small library of academic articles to seed my larger Zettle worldview
    - "Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? "
        - It has been time consuming, for sure. But I know a lot of it was clumsy because it's my first time through the process. Having the support network and accountability of this group has helped, and I'm certain I can distill and refine the process to be more efficient as I process more media and types of media through my Zettle awareness
        - I think part of the process requires that one take the time to think and write about one's ideas. That is not easy, and it's not always lightning fast, so there may be some frustration until one accepts that this is built into the process. (Similar to the passage on writing notes by hands, though a different application)
    - "How is your progress towards your initial goals? Or have they changed?"
        - Fantastic. And enjoying the process thoroughly as a direct function of the support systems in this group. Thank you to the organizers!
    - "Explore the concept of permanent notes/zettels."
        - "Explain what a permanent note is in your own words?"
            - Permanent notes are self-generated units of grounded awareness. These are thoughts that have supporting evidence (references to literature) and can be combined into larger positions, publications, or overarching worldviews.
        - "What is holding you back from creating zettels?"
            - Nothing - it's the next step in the process.
        - "What are you unsure about? "
            - Little, just need to sit down and do the next part of the process.
    - "Do you have any questions for [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]]?"
        - In your awareness, what triggers Zettel tinkering? How do you know it's time to make one? Or refine an existing one?
        - What are the standard formats, metadata, conventions, or other mechanical best practices that you use in Roam in your Zettle? 
            - Anyone else have Zettel conventions to share?

            - I have invested more time and energy into understanding this one book than any other book or other media in my entire life. And it's so worth it!
                - Part of this is that I'm investing a lot of time into thinking about and setting up the architecture of my mental latticeworks. This takes time to tinker and I'm deeply grateful to the Book Club for the learnings, guidance, and best practices (CSS, nesting formats, etc)
            - As I've gone back over the book for multiple iterations I've gained ever deeper understandings. Also helps tremendously to have the notes and conversations from the Book Club.
            - This book is complex because it covers both big ideas (learning, writing, excellence) as well as very practical workflows (Zetteling) that are mostly, but not completely, defined. Without immediate examples, the abstract explanation seems to have yielded a variety of interpretations.
            - I have hit pause on reading pretty much anything else until I get my Zettel process dialed in because I want to make sure to do it right (as best as possible at any given moment) with everything from here on out
        - Why do you want a Zettelkasten? [*]()
            - Learning (Dialogue partner, accountability partner, emergent wisdom)
            - Expressing (Writing non-fiction, among other projects)
            - Optimizing (Knowledge+awareness scaffold, repeatable workflow, atomized tasks, quantifiable pipeline)
        - Reflect on your Zettel process [*](((PHU7lXKIB)))
            - Super duper clunky at first. First pass was not elegant or scaleable
            - After session with [[Beau Haan]] I thought long and hard and now appreciate the scalable value of this approach
            - Reworking my past Zettel setup to mimic the encouraged setup for the Book Club
    - Beau prompts
        - "Template - Apply children as text"
            - #[[Zettels]] [[Active reading becomes effortless with a routine of smart note-taking.]]
                - #[[Literature Notes]] [Chapter 14. (Paragraph 6))](((4hIM0I_l_)))
                    - To deeply understand a text, it is sufficient to build up new habits of smart note-taking. The initial startup effort quickly becomes effortless and intuitive because of the obvious and immediate benefits. It becomes difficult to imagine going back or reading in any other way.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Building up a productive habit will be easy because it's self-reinforcing
                    - This reminds me of [[The Willpower Instinct]] book and all those strategies to strengthen willpower of a new habit
                    - The act of developing new routines requires substantial effort. Even knowing the value and striving for it actively, not having guidance could make this an insurmountable task
                        - There is no doubt I would not have understood, valued, or used this book so purposefully without the guidance of the Book Club
        - 
    - Big questions for me: Must Zettels have a 1:1 relationship with literature notes?
        - In my first pass on creation in my personal graph, I started with Zettels as not linked to individual literature notes.
        - Also, it does not appear practical to "summarize in my own words" (lit note) and Zettel some of the passages that I highlighted. Do some notes stop at lit and not move up to Zettel but still hang around?
        - 
- [[Live Session 6]] on [[December 6th, 2020]]
    - "Questions for us from [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]]"
        - "What have you learnt about note taking that I (SÃ¶nke) should know about?"
            - I've learned that the way I was digesting information previously is largely misaligned with my overarching goal of developing a robust evidence-based worldview. Smart notes is a much better workflow for what I seek.
            - I learned that taking smart notes is time-consuming. 
                - Part of that is the clunkiness of trying it for the first time
                - Part of that is learning zettels in chunks from fleeting --> fugul instead of seeing an example of a functioning zettelkasten first and then working my way backward to how I need to start today 
        - "Are there any additions to the process described in the book?"
            - In my book review page, I have added a few more sections beyond the suggested Zetteling process:
                - Summary - quick 30 second overview of the key points of this book. Useful as a reference for myself, or others later, to see if this book is relevant for the questions at hand
                    - Now that I understand zettelkasten better, this may phase out over time. I like the idea of synthesizing the main points into a simple summary, but I don't know if the branches of discovery from Zetteling will make the summary step less useful.
                - Action items - what do I learn practically for myself that I need to start doing? What needs to get added to my queue of productivity so I can put these insights into motion?
                    - My top action item is "Begin zetteling immediately!!" :)
                - Quote Collection - these are direct quotes from the author (not referential text) that I like and can see myself slipping into publications or conversations later
                - To Research - this speaks to direct bibliographic references that I want to dig into the primary research directly
                - Highlights - I will not have access to the full text in a roam graph as we did here, so I went through a traditional workflow with a physical book where Readwise (via OCR in app) pulled in all of my "highlights" (I put in quotes because I can't stand marking a book so I use sticky tabs to mark highlights that I later remove)
                    - These are directly pulled quotes from the text that inform my fleeting, literature, to research, and quote collection notes
            - From the text of the book, I got lost after making permanent notes and was at all clear how that maps to the larger zettelkasten workflow.
                - I understood the points conceptually, but when I sat down to write zettels it didn't go very well. And I wasn't clear on how to really build out the true "dialogue partner" until [[Beau Haan]] showed me.
                - This is my biggest feedback for the book - being able to see an example of each of the steps would add a tremendous amount of clarity for how to implement the overall process.
                    - I understand not wanting to anchor or be directive as each zettelkasten is specific and unique to each individual. But there are mechanics and workflows that can be shared that would be tremendously helpful as I set up my personalized flow.
        - "Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten?"
            - I have thought long and hard about this, and I cannot think of a single situation where Zetteling doesn't work
            - I think in some situations it may make less sense. For example, when I'm reading a fiction book for fun it's unlikely I'll care to rev zettels out of it
                - That said, I can imagine some ideas or concepts in fiction triggering fleeting notes that may want to get pulled into my larger Zettelkasten. This would become especially relevant if I was focused on writing fiction literature (I am not)
            - Another fascinating use case I was noodling on is with creative or performing arts. How would I zettel a music score? Or a dance performance? Or a sculpture?
                - Incidentally, I think it's still possible but may be a little more clunky
                - I will try this out later when I build out my "Arts" zettelkasten. This will be a distinct slip box from my intellectually oriented writing / publication slip box.
    - "General review questions "
        - "Reflect on your impressions of the book "
            - Life-altering text. This is the crystallization seed for a new way of being for me.
            - This book, and learning how to create a zettelkasten, is the single biggest development in my intellectual trajectory in the last decade. So grateful!
        - "Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?"
            - Umm, just about everything.
                - How I read the text (more actively now)
                - How I take notes (the full zettel flow vs. no notes at all)
                - How I digest my notes (processing sequentially vs. no process at all)
                - How I internalize the information (into zettelkasten, instead of abstractly think about then forget it)
                - How I build a centralized repository of my consciousness (somewhere vs. nowhere)
        - "Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?  "
            - Why would I ever go back to the horse and buggy when I've been given a rocket ship?
- [[Live Session 7]] on [[December 13th, 2020]]
    - "You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say? "
        - Zettelkasten is an information management system that optimizes for active learning, insight, and productivity.
        - This system is useful for anyone that wants to cultivate more diligent, complete, and coherent modalities of thinking (dialogue & accountability partner) & creating (productivity and idea engine, writing workflow).
        - The workflow revolves around the unit of "meaningful notes" that progress through a pipeline from fleeting to literature to permanent to interconnected meaningful notes.
            - I think the framing of "smart notes" is a touch pedantic, albeit true. I hypothesize that meaningful notes may be less insulting and more approachable than "smart notes".
    - "Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?"
        - It was a complete paradigm shift in my entire cognition. How I read, write, think, communicate, and organize have all been impacted positively by this book.
        - I come back to the horse & buggy vs. rocket ship analogy. Before, I was barely getting from point A to point B and it took so long I forgot the road in the first place. With the rocket ship, I can get to so many places so much faster on this planet, and I can also conceive of reaching whole new universes that were previously unobtanium for me.
    - "The book promotes a bottom up approach to note taking, which we have used in Book Club. Reflect on this. How did this feel? "
        - The "bottom up" approach feels remarkable gentle, kind, and nurturing.
            - Releases a substantial amount of shame and guilt for me for "not knowing" or "forgetting" valuable info
            - Its super welcoming because it accepts me exactly as I am today knowing that I will grow more insight tomorrow. A lot like tending an already ripe intellectual garden.
            - Wow, how relieving to not have to "know the answer" and to simply seek it with earnestness, accepting that my "answer" will necessarily change as I read, learn, understand, write, and grow
        - It also feels a lot more intellectually honest
            - I don't have to approach with an explicit agenda - instead, I just focus on curiosity and diligence
                - All I need to do is read what interests me and extract the relevant notes. That's it!! Everything else emerges from there
            - Bakes in some structural blockers for cognitive biases. I love that.
    - "What's your favourite blocks (or quotes) from the book?"
        - Thats my "[[Quote Collection]]" :)
            - ...not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. [Page 5](((ewE8yeHMT)))
            - Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head. [Page 23](((FXTiDcAuy)))
            - Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work. [Page 29](((3UUi5E7dV)))
            - The presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin. [Page 36](((DLGYIldBd)))
            - The idea is not to copy, but to have a meaningful dialogue with the texts we read. [Page 75](((npPL8R8U5)))
            - The mere copying of quotes almost always changes the meaning by stripping them out of context, even though the words aren't changed. [PageÂ 75](((KIacMFyQe)))
            - If you spend your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn. [Page 105](((toMow84dV)))
            - The real enemy of independent thinking is not an external authority, but our own inertia. [PageÂ 124](((P0rytwjuF)))
            - We tried to emulate birds by flapping wing-like apparatuses with feathers and all, but in the end, the ... subtle bending of the wing is the only thing that counts. [PageÂ 129](((JcEKjeqV3)))
            - Good questions are in the sweet spot of being relevant and interesting, not too easy to answer but possible to tackle with material that is available or at least within our reach. [PageÂ 136](((OhDDjaMPG)))
    - "We went through the process fleeting notes, literature notes, zettels. But the real power comes from connecting them.  "
        - "How do we link? "
            - I like using Beau's flow of Relevant Notes (see my example in the book page above)
            - Of course, the tags help with resurfacing certain concepts again later
            - "Note to Note "
            - "By Topic?"
    - "Reflect on Roam Book Club"
        - Absolutely incredible. Some of the smartest people I've met in a long time, all with a selection bias towards the things that I care about deeply.
        - This has easily been the most interesting, insightful, and compelling book club I've ever experienced. I am deeply honored to have the ability to participate.
        - This book club (and this book, of course) have prompted a complete paradigm shift and cured my cognitive constipation (see my Roamkasten writeup on my personal page)
            - There is no shadow of a doubt that I would not have grokked this book and all of it's glory and power without the book club AND Beau's training. One or the other alone would not have sufficed.
    - "Comment on your impressions of the shared graph"
        - Messy and chaotic, though I love seeing how others structure their pages.
        - Tremendously helpful for me to learn from power users and brilliant thinkers.
        - The lack of coherent structure does not limit the value and function for me
    - ""Q: What were the most effective and/or useful conventions arrived at for making multiplayer work in the club?""
    - "Were you surprised by anything in the graph?"
    - "Reflect on the shared multi-player zettelkasten of Book Club"
    - "Refer to the #Zettels page. Any favourites? Any why?"
        - "#Process [[Simplicity in our process and thought enables the complexity we want in our work.]]"
        - "#Flow [[When structured thoughtfully, effort at work can become effortless as we enter a flow state of productivity.]]"
            - "#Energy [[Flow energizes the work you do so the energy should be put into creating a structure which incubates that flow]]"
    - "Have we finished? Do you feel you have clarity about the Zettelkasten process in Roam? "
        - For now, mostly. I have enough to feel empowered to tackle my backlog of articles and books and feel confident in digesting that into Mein Zettel.
        - I have a handful of outstanding questions noted here: "My outstanding Roamkasten questions and unknowns"
            - The most important outstanding question is the workflow for refining zettels downstream
                - If I find contradictory evidence, or otherwise new awareness that I'd like to utilize to refine an existing Zettel, how do I do that?
                    - Not sure I want to change my existing zettel because I'd like to retain how the idea morphed over time
                    - Maybe I write a new zettel and drop the existing one to a "deprecated thoughts" section below? That seems clunky. Have to play with it.
                    - Any other suggestions?
