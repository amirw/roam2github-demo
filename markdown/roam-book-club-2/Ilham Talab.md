    - [[Goals for Book Club]]
        - I am thinking about this particular book, not the Book Club as a whole... 
            - I want to think clearly and better - I think this book will help me organize my thoughts 
            - Be able to #remember most of my readings by organizing my thoughts more critically and systematically 
                - the principles of [[Sönke Ahrens]]'s book combined with #Roam equals a powerful tool
                    - I can track my notes 
                    - I can link my #thoughts 
                    - hopefully I will be able to #remember my thoughts especially that the linking parts is ongoing and I will meet my older notes in the future as I continue to consume more #information and generate #knowledge 
            - increase my ability to connect several thoughts together and generate new ideas #[[networked thinking]]
                - Its better when there is a goal, but even without an ultimate goal in advance, the process itself could create or lead to that goal 
                    - at the moment, I dont have a specific goal of what new ideas I am looking for
