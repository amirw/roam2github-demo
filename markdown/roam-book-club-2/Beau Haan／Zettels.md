        - #[[Literature Notes]] [Chapter 14. (Paragraph 6))](((4hIM0I_l_)))
            - An alternative strategy that aligns with one's true desires establishes the pull that creates a new habit
            - As the disadvantages of instant gratifications wears thin, the powerful force that comes from the incentive reward system habitualizes the difficult--into effortlessness 
            - This also gives way to hope for others by engaging our altruistic need to help those that are suffering 
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Even with my foolishness when attempting to do something new might cloud my judgement, as long as I follow my desires with enough emotional drive, then I am able to begin this journey of intuitively knowing how to handle the situations that used to baffle me (Thumbnail of what's below)
            - This reminds me of the pain that it takes to take on a new habit
            - I can remember first starting at the gym and the absolute cluelessness that I entered that space, and yet I still acted "cocky" because I didn't want to look like I had not fucking idea what I was doing
            - Breaking habits is incredibly difficult when I think about it, and I think about my own past--dealing with alcoholism and drug addiction as a kid growing up
                - It even reminds me of all of the times that I attempted to stop, to only find myself in the same predicament just a week later
            - This habit of fetching a pen and paper seems dated, when I have such a powerful note-taking tool like [[Roam]]
            - That urge that he talks about is what I really desire
                - To have a place where I can go each and every time without having to think about it
                    - It's just like how I go to the gym nowadays. I've done it so much that, even when I don't want to go, I just end up there, and afterwards it's like all of my endorphins are pumping and I'm solid
                        - This reminds me of the incentive reward system, and how when I am able to see my progress towards a goal, the dopaminergic responses that it produces creates an analgesic to the pain of adopting a new habit
            - Intuitively knowing how to handle the next situation is crucial when it comes to actually having a system of note-taking that I can trust in... interesting...
            - As for watching others continue down a path that reinforces something that they don't desire--is my driving force! 
                - That's my WHY!
