    - I think the analysis of why a [[Zettelkasten]] overcomes the limitations of the mind is flawed
        - if we want to increase our learning and understanding, then we should, as much as possible, focus on [[retrieval practice]] and NOT writing per se

        - it is important not to MERELY reread permanent notes, but first to try to create them (retrieval practice through self-testing) and only to read them subsequent to the testing
