- #Question [[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]] How do YOU create notes for questions? Are they [[fleeting notes]]? How would you deal with refining or follow-up questions?
    - It seems to me that a persistent idea might be better framed as a question. At some point it might start to look like an assertion. And then at some point, would all related questions be nested under the assertion?
        - #Reply-from [[Brandon Toner]] I agree! [[assertions]] are a maturity step in my notes. Almost everything starts as an idea, or a question. As those accumulate I form [[opinions]]. And eventually, those opinions strengthen. [[@[[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]]]] #[[My Zettelkasten Workflow]]

I use `#[[Zettel Questions]]` to address this. Feeling better about this very thing this week. And had a great day in the [[zettelkasten]] in my personal database. I'll be reflecting further on that in here. 

Here is my working array of note tags. 

[[reference notes]] — the bibliographic material and direct highlights

[[seedlings]] — bits of original inspiration, loose in format and tone-of-voice. More informal. 

[[fleeting notes]] — [[assertions]] start here. These are statements and claims. But not well thought out, yet.

[[literature notes]] — these are summaries of the author's main points. In my own words.

[[evergreen notes]] or [[permanent notes]] — these are the accumulation of [[fleeting notes]], [[seedlings]], and [[literature notes]] into a stronger idea [[synthesis]]. Densely linked and referenced, ideally. This is peak maturity of an [[atomic idea]].

[[zettel questions]] — these are questions I think of. Captured curiosities. Anything I'm wondering about. This may get noisy and I may need a tier for refined questions. Not yet, though.

[[project ideas]] — writing & creative projects — where I put the [[zettelkasten]] to work.

[[queries]] — this is where I find stray notes of these categories from around my database to gather the originals back here. Most of these notes form in some other [[context]].

            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FrP76Z9wEcq.png?alt=media&token=271505a3-2826-415a-aec1-f150a2fba6b7)
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] I love it! 
        - Yes ... for me questions often feel so "important" that I want to make them their own category. I've experimented with calling them "Zettelquestions". I think they are a different form of "organizer" entirely - not statements about what we DO know or what we DO feel comfortable asserting, but rather, pointers of our active curiosity, illuminating the things we do not yet know. 
            - In that sense, I think they are closer to what I am calling "Permanent Notes" in the nomenclature - which is to say, I grant them provisional permanence within the evolving slip-box - but I like to think of them as their own category.
                - #Reply-from [[Brandon Toner]] Loving "provisional permanence" as a framing. #[[permanent notes]]

Almost feels like an oxy-moron haha
- #Chat[[Mike Kramer]][[Ryan Holiday]] and [[Robert Greene]] do nothing more than [[tag]] their notes (i.e., categorize them), without links, in their analog commonplace book or [[Zettelkasten]]

            - # The Notecard System: The Key For Remembering, Organizing And Using Everything You Read - RyanHoliday.net
            - by Ryan Holiday
            - 16-20 minutes
            - ![photo-2 (1)](https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/photo-2-1.jpg?w=584&h=584)
            - After the response to [this recent LifeHacker piece](https://lifehacker.com/im-ryan-holiday-and-this-is-how-i-work-1485776137), I thought I would explain [the system](https://www.writingroutines.com/) I use to take notes, research books and keep track of anecdotes, stories and info I come across in my work.
            - This isn’t the perfect system. It might not work for you. All I can say is that since learning it about 7 years ago, it has totally transformed my process and drastically increased my creative output. It’s responsible for helping me publish [three books in three years](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591846358/ryanholnet-20), (along with other books I’ve had the privilege of contributing to), write countless articles published in newspapers and websites, [send out my reading recommendations every month](https://ryanholiday.net/reading-newsletter/), and make all sorts of other work and personal successes possible.
            - Now to be clear, this is not “my” notecard system. If anything, I use a perverted version of a system taught to me by the genius [Robert Greene](http://powerseductionandwar.com/), when I was his research assistant. What he taught me was neat, clean and orderly. Mine is more of a mess. But it’s still be hugely helpful to me and I think I’m in a unique position to explain this method to people.
            - I hope it inspires your own method.
            - ## The System
            - -It’s difficult to describe this in any linear way so I am just going to do this in kind a brain dump way. By the end of it, I promise the system will make sense.
            - -If I have a thought, I write it down on a 4×6 notecard and identify it with a theme–or if I am working on a specific project, where it would fit in the project. For instance, as I was preparing for my next book, [__The Obstacle is The Way__](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1591846358/ryanholnet-20), I filled out thousands of these cards for ideas and concepts that I wanted included in the book. Some examples:
            - “Don’t be the slave of circumstance.” (intro)
            - “We know objectively that we learn from failure, yet we spend all our time trying to avoid it. Why?” (intro)
            - “Gaman–the Japanese word for endurance” (Persistence)
            - “Our actions our constrained, our will is not. We always decide whether we continue or not.” (Will)
            - “Ulysses S. Grant–incident at Mathew Brady’s studio where glass fell on him and he didn’t move. Also, where he ran toward the explosion at City Point. See: Simpson’s bio” (Nerve)
            - So those are the kinds of notes I write to myself. Either sentences in my own writing, words I like, questions I have, or examples I think might fit somewhere and want to learn more about.
            - -Most of the time, what I write down are quotes (I used to [put them on a blog instead](https://ryanholiday.net/quotes-and-passages/) but it was too unwieldy). They’re either famous quotes or quotes from the writer that I think are smart. It’s very important that you mark quotes properly so you never risk forgetting to attribute. To make this extra clear, I always put a circle around the first quotation mark. If I am quoting someone quoting someone else, I’ll usually write “qtd in.”
            - -If it’s a really long story or example, I will just jot down a few notes on the key points and then put something like: “For a story about _________ see: pg 14 in [insert book].”
            - Here are some quotes from my Strategy cards:
            - “It is better to see once than hear a hundred times.” – Gorbachev
            - Retort: “You may not be afraid to have your hand cut off, but your body will suffer.” – John D. Rockefeller
            - “Politeness is to human nature what warmth is to wax.” – Schopenhauer pg 77
            - “Pursuit should be to the last breath of man and beast.” – (Prussian Maxim qtd in Knights Cross)
            - “All men work more zealously against their enemies than they cooperate with their friends.” – Caesar qtd in Schiff’s Cleopatra pg 19
            - “Find them! Fix them! Fight them! Finish them!” – Gen. Ridgway/military slogan in Korean War. qtd in Savior Generals.
            - So those are the kinds of quotes I grab for one particular topic. Most of the quotes are longer than that, but space is constrained here in this post so I won’t rewrite the longer ones for you. For longer quotes, I will type them out and print them. Then I cut them out and tape them to a notecard.
            - ![image (26)](https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image-26.jpeg?w=584&h=584)
            - -I’ve talked about this before, but [the key to this system is the ritual](https://ryanholiday.net/read-to-lead-how-to-digest-books-above-your-level/): Read a book or an article and diligently mark the passages and portions that stand out at you. If you have a thought, write it down on the page (this is called marginalia). Fold the bottom corner of the page where you’ve made a note or marked something (alternatively, use post-it flags).
            - -A few weeks after [finishing the book](https://www.writingroutines.com/how-to-write-book/), return to it and transfer those notes/thoughts on to the appropriate note cards. Why wait? Waiting helps you separate the wheat from the chaff. I promise that many of the pages you marked will not seem to important or noteworthy when you return to them. This is a good thing–it’s a form of editing.
            - -In the top right hand corner of each card, put a theme or category that this card belongs to. If a card can fit in multiple categories, just make a duplicate card. Robert uses color coded cards for an extra layer of organization.
            - ![image (25)](https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image-25.jpeg?w=584&h=438)
            - **Some categories I currently use:**
            - *Stoicism
            - *Life (General advice about life)
            - *[The Narrative Fallacy](https://ryanholiday.net/the-narrative-fallacy/) (Something I’d like to write a book about one day)
            - *Strategy (Examples of strategic genius or wisdom)
            - *Post Ideas (Many cards here have been turned into articles you’ve read)
            - *Animals (Weird stories about animals. For instance, according to the book [One Summer by Bill Bryson](https://www.amazon.com/One-Summer-America-Bill-Bryson/dp/0767919408?tag=ryanholnet-20), the hotel that Babe Ruth lived in for most of his career had a live seal living in the lobby fountain)
            - *[Trust Me, I’m Lying](https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Me-Lying-Confessions-Manipulator/dp/1591846285?tag=ryanholnet-20) (Media manipulation)
            - *[Writing](https://ryanholiday.net/so-you-want-to-be-a-writer-thats-mistake-1/) (Wisdom about the craft)
            - *[Education](https://ryanholiday.net/finding-hidden-education-subsidies/) (Wisdom and ideas about learning)
            - *Misc (Naturally)
            - -As you compile cards and study different things, it’s not uncommon to organically begin coming across unexpected themes. This is how new categories are born.
            - -If you are working on a book project where there are a limited amount of themes or you know exactly what they are, it makes sense to introduce a shorthand. For instance, with my last book [__Growth__ __Hacker Marketing__](https://www.amazon.com/Growth-Hacker-Marketing-Advertising-Portfolio-ebook/dp/B00BPDR3JM/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1387495978&sr=1-1&keywords=growth+hacker+marketing&tag=ryanholnet-20), I had 6 themes that roughly corresponded with the chapters and structure of the book:
            - 1) Intro
            - 2) Growth Hacking
            - 3) Product Market Fit
            - 4) Growth Hacks
            - 5) Virality
            - 6) Optimization and Retention
            - (Misc)
            - -If anyone hassles me about my sloppy handwriting in the photos, I swear to god…
            - -Originally I would do one set of note cards for a whole book (numbering the cards 1,2,3,4,5 etc–but I found that limited my ability to move the pieces around because unrelated but important ideas were wrongly joined together.
            - -I think it’s important that the notes are not just about work. In mine, my two most important categories are “Life” (which is mostly advice for myself) and another called “Me”, where I put things that I think are important criticisms or places for improvement in my own life. (By that I mean stuff about dealing with parents, relationships, etc. Just little reminders that help.)
            - ![image (24)](https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image-24.jpeg?w=584&h=588)
            - **Here are some cards from those sections:**
            - “He’s detached about __your__ pain, but God knows he takes his own pain more seriously than cancer… It finally dawned on me that my father, for all his protestations and lectures and writing about detachment, is a very, very needy man.” Margaret Salinger, qtd in Salinger pg 570 (Me)
            - These people don’t work hard enough for their opinions to matter to you. (Life)
            - “Just because you’re winning a game doesn’t mean it’s a good game.” Seth Godin, __Icarus Deception__ (Life)
            - “Q: Ok, but what should I be most worried about here? A: __Nothing__ should worry you” conversation with a friend (Me)
            - “Character is fate.” Heraclitus (Life)
            - “If you see fraud and do not say fraud, you are a fraud.” – Taleb
            - Don’t pick fights with members of your own team. (Life)
            - “You know workmen by the chips they leave.” – Old saying (Life)
            - -Don’t stress about filling up whole cards. I have hundreds that just have a ONE or TWO words on them. These might be cool new words that I’ve never heard before, words I think have a lot of meaning in them, reminders about topics I want to mention.
            - -Helpful tip: If you end up using the back of the card (I do it fairly often), put an arrow on the front side. Sometimes when you’re flipping through them, you miss the fact that there is text on the back.
            - -Get in the habit. If you have an idea, put it on a damn card. If you don’t, you’ll regret it. I can’t tell you how many times I saved my ass writing down a title idea or a thought, I otherwise would have forgotten. It’s a good thing when your own cards surprise you.
            - -When I go back through the cards, I’ll often remember other things from more recent reading or thinking and add to them. This is why, if you went through all mine, you’d see different colors of ink on the same card.
            - ## Other People Who Use This
            - -I want to be clear that I’m not the one who invented this. I didn’t even perfect it. I’m just explaining it because people asked.
            - -Here’s Robert explaining his system in [an interview with Andrew Warner at Mixergy](http://mixergy.com/robert-greene-mastery-interview/) (he shows one of his boxes on camera if you feel like looking):
            - I read a book and I take, as I’m reading it, I underline it and put [notes on the side](https://www.writingroutines.com/how-to-write-book/) and then I go back and put them on notecards. And I can gauge a good book will generate 20 to 31 notecards. A bad book will generate two or three notecards and I will find themes in this book and I will take a book that’s maybe not organized very well and I will do the organizing. On page 30 you talk about this and you talk about it on page 180, you should have put those two together but I’m going to put those two together. And I find the themes in there and I break the book down into the gist of it, the heart of it.
            - And, I categorize it later as I move into the process, I see these themes and patterns that you were talking about that an apprenticeship, creativity, working with a mentor, social intelligence. Slowly the chapters come to life and I’m now able to organize it in various chapters. Each part has the title of the book on it and is color coded, having different colors of cards, depending on the kind of subject that I’m dealing with. If it’s the arts, science, [generic drugs](https://nosorh.org/generic-cialis/), politics, etc. It’s elaborate. You don’t want to know everything about it, but with this there now, if I’ve done all that work and I sit down to write, I have at my fingertips, all of this. If I want to do Leonardo da Vinci, I have 50 notecards that break him down from every possible angle. I can now, with that, write in a much fuller, deeper, dimensional way because I’ve taken all this information and I’ve organized it.
            - -Someone also asked him about it in his Reddit AMA. [Here is that exchange](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1cmb0d/i_am_robert_greene_author_of_the_48_laws_of_power/c9hv3g8) with some info about the color coding:
            - user: Robert, I’m a big fan of yours. In one interview you mentioned your research method for your books (with index cards and shoe boxes). Could you provide some more detail on the process of your method?
            - [–]robertgreene I read a book, very carefully, writing on the margins with all kinds of notes. A few weeks later I return to the book, and transfer my scribbles on to note cards each card representing an important theme in the book. For instance, in Mastery, the theme of mirror neurons. After going through several dozen books, I might have three hundred cards, and from those cards I see patterns and themes that coalesce into hardcore chapters. I can then thumb through the cards and move them around at will. For many reasons I find this an incredible way to shape a book.
            - user: Ah–found it! Still curious about the colors, but I guess the obvious answer is that they would represent categories, topics, and the like. ![🙂](https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.0/svg/1f642.svg)
            - [–]robertgreene The colors represent categories, you are correct. So, for instance, with the War book, blue cards would be about politics, yellow strictly war, green the arts and entertainment, pink cards on strategy, etc. I could use this in several ways. I could glance at the cards for one chapter and see no blue or green cards and realize a problem. I could also take out all the cards of one color to see which story I liked best, etc. It also made the shoebox look pretty cool.
            - user: That’s ingenious–so you’ve effectively created a relational database in a shoebox, because you can have many to many relationships between card colors and chapters. Your passion for organization is one of the (many) things that makes your work so incredibly fun to read and reference. Thank you for sharing some of that with us.
            - -It looks like the system is also very similar to Luhmann’s [Zettelkasten](https://takingnotenow.blogspot.com/2007/12/luhmanns-zettelkasten.html). Though again, his discipline seems to exceed mine because I am a lot less ordered.
            - –[Ronald Reagan also kept a similar system](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-05-08-reagan-notes-book-brinkley_n.htm) that apparently very few people knew about until he died. In his system, he used 3×5 notecards and kept them in a photo binder by theme. These note cards–which were mostly filled with quotes–have actually been turned [into a book edited by the historian Douglas Brinkley](https://www.amazon.com/The-Notes-Reagans-Private-Collection/dp/0062065130/ref=pd_sim_b_1?tag=ryanholnet-20). These were not only responsible for many of his speeches as president, but before office Reagan delivered hundreds of talks as part of his role at General Electric. There are about 50 years of practical wisdom in these cards. Far more than anything I’ve assembled–whatever you think of the guy. I highly recommend at least looking at it.
            - -It’s not totally dissimilar to the Dewey Decimal system and old library card catalogs.
            - -I’m sure there are other awesome people who use a similar system. If anyone has examples, send away!
            - ![image (23)](https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/image-23.jpeg?w=584&h=437)
            - ## FAQ
            - **What do you use these note cards for?** Whatever I want! Recently I started tweeting quotes that I had taken note of. But that’s just a little thing. I use these notecards for my life. When I have a problem, I flip through them. When I am looking for material in my writing, I use them. For instance, [I wrote this post exclusively off my notecards](http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/10/35-badass-quote-that-will-make-you-rethink-going-to-college/) (if you couldn’t tell).
            - **How do you know what to write down?** You just write down whatever you want. Don’t stress about it. This is your system. We all have our own preferences. Personally, I look for actionable, small sized chunks.
            - **Where do you put the cards?** I have one big box that I used that’s actually meant for photos. It’s called a [Cropper Hopper](https://www.amazon.com/Cropper-Hopper-4-Inch-6-Inch-Purple/dp/B000S14TNA/ref=pd_sim_ac_3?tag=ryanholnet-20). But it took me a long time to acquire enough cards to need that. Before, I used the smaller[Vaultz 4×6 Index Card File boxes](https://www.amazon.com/Vaultz-4x6-Index-Black-VZ01171/dp/B000GP0Z68/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1377530158&sr=8-1&keywords=vaultz+index+card+box&tag=ryanholnet-20). There are also cheaper cardboard versions out there.
            - **What do you do when a box gets full?** If I am taking notes for a specific project, like a book, I give it it’s own box. For instance, my __Cash Money__ book is just about at the stage where it can fill up a Vaultz box. After another hundred or so notecards, I’ll move it into it’s own Cropper Hopper.
            - **Wouldn’t digital be easier?** Yes. But I don’t want this to be easy. Writing them down by hand forces me to take my time and to go over everything again (taking notes on a Kindle is too easy and that’s the problem). Also being able to physically arrange stuff is crucial for getting the structure of your book or project right. I can move cards from one category to another. As I shuffle through the cards, I bump into stuff I had forgotten about, etc.
            - **Isn’t it hard to carry around?** Yeah, a little. But so what? It pays off so it’s worth it. Joking aside, what I tend to do is just take the section I am working on with me. If I am working on chapter 2–I take those cards. If I am writing a post about education, I’ll take the education cards with me. Very rarely do I find that I need the whole thing with me.
            - **How do you remember it all?** That’s why doing it physically is so important. I am invested in each one of these cards. I made them and arranged them with my own hands. This tactile relationship helps. As one reader put it, it helps make a “memory palace.” I don’t vaguely remember what I put on the note cards, but where I put it, what it’s connected to, what’s around it, when I did it, etc.
            - **Do you review the cards?** Absolutely. If I am lacking inspiration or just kicking something new off, I always try to flip back through them. It doesn’t have to be all of them either. Just grab a few. Another example: When I wrote the new foreword for __[Trust Me I’m Lying](https://www.amazon.com/Trust-Me-Lying-Confessions-Manipulator/dp/1591846285/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1387497544&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=trust+me+i%27m+lying&tag=ryanholnet-20)__, I started by going back through the cards. When I starting prepping the paperback of __[Growth Hacker Marketing](https://www.amazon.com/Growth-Hacker-Marketing-Advertising-Portfolio-ebook/dp/B00BPDR3JM/ref=sr_1_cc_3?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1387497544&sr=1-3-catcorr&keywords=trust+me+i%27m+lying&tag=ryanholnet-20)__ (out in 2014), I went through the cards and was able to find a place for some that I hadn’t used the first time.
            - **But wouldn’t Evernote be better?** Maybe for you but not for me. If that’s what you want to use then go for it. But I think there is something irreplaceable about the physical aspect. Physical books, physical notecards, that’s the best in my opinion.
            - **What if something happened to your box?** [My house recently got robbed](http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/11/a-lesson-from-the-worlds-worst-week/) and I was so fucking terrified that someone took it, you have no idea. Thankfully they didn’t. I am actually thinking of using [TaskRabbit](https://www.taskrabbit.com/) to have someone create a digital backup. In the meantime, these boxes are what I’m running back into a fire for to pull out (in fact, I sometimes keep them in a fireproof safe).

            - Make your own way. But I think you’ll love this system.

            - # How And Why To Keep A “Commonplace Book” - RyanHoliday.net
            - by Ryan Holiday
            - 10-13 minutes
            - The other day I was reading a book and I came across a little anecdote. It was about the great Athenian general Themistocles. Before the battle of Salamis, he was locked in a vigorous debate with a Spartan general about potential strategies for defeating the Persians. Themistocles was clearly in the minority with his views (but which ultimately turned out to be right and saved Western Civilization). He continued to interpret and contradict the other generals. Finally, the Spartan general threatened to strike Themistocles if he didn’t shut up and stop. “Strike!” Themistocles shouted back, “But listen!”
            - When I read this, I immediately began a ritual that I have practiced for many years–and that others have done for centuries before me–I marked down the passage and later transferred it to my [“commonplace book.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book) Why? Because it’s a great line and it stood out to me. I wrote it down, I’ll want to have it around for later reference, for potentially [using it in my writing](https://www.writingroutines.com/how-to-write-book/) or work, or for possible inspiration at some point in the future.
            - In other posts, we’ve talked about [how to read more](https://ryanholiday.net/how-to-read-more-a-lot-more/), [which books to read](https://ryanholiday.net/24-books-youve-probably-never-heard-of-but-will-change-your-life/), how to [read books above your level](https://ryanholiday.net/read-to-lead-how-to-digest-books-above-your-level/) and [how to write](https://www.writingroutines.com/). Well, the commonplace book is a thread that runs through all those ideas. It what ties those efforts together and makes you better at each one of them. I was introduced and taught a certain version of this system by [Robert Greene](http://powerseductionandwar.com/) and now I am passing along the lessons because they’ve helped me so much.
            - ![](https://thoughtcatalog.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/photo-2.jpg?w=584&h=584)
            - ### What is a Commonplace book?
            - A commonplace book is a central resource or depository for ideas, quotes, anecdotes, observations and information you come across during your life and didactic pursuits. The purpose of the book is to record and organize these gems for later use in your life, in your business, in your writing, speaking or whatever it is that you do.
            - Some of the greatest men and women in history have kept these books. [Marcus Aurelius](https://dailystoic.com/marcus-aurelius/) kept one–which more or less became the __[Meditations](https://dailystoic.com/meditations-marcus-aurelius/)__. Petrarch kept one. Montaigne, who invented the essay, kept a handwritten compilation of sayings, maxims and quotations from literature and history that he felt were important. His earliest essays were little more than compilations of these thoughts. Thomas Jefferson kept one. Napoleon kept one. HL Mencken, who did so much for the English language, as his biographer put it, “methodically filled notebooks with incidents, recording straps of dialog and slang” and favorite bits from newspaper columns he liked. Bill Gates keeps one.
            - Not only did all these famous and great individuals do it. But so have common people throughout history. Our true understanding of the Civil War, for example, is a result of the spread of [cheap diaries and notebooks that soldiers could record their thoughts in](https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/dear-diary/). Art of Manliness recently did an amazing post about[ the history of pocket notebooks.](http://www.artofmanliness.com/2010/08/23/the-manly-tradition-of-the-pocket-notebook/) Some people have gone as far as to claim that [Pinterest is a modern iteration of the commonplace book.](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/08/16/social-media-nothing-new-commonplace-books-as-predecessor-to-pinterest.html)
            - And if you still need a why–I’ll let this quote from [Seneca](https://dailystoic.com/seneca/) answer it (which I got from my own reading and notes):
            - “We should hunt out the helpful pieces of teaching and the spirited and noble-minded sayings which are capable of immediate practical application–not far far-fetched or archaic expressions or extravagant metaphors and figures of speech–and learn them so well that words become works.”
            - ### How to Do It (Right)
            - –[Read widely](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/www.ryanholiday.net/how-to-read-more-a-lot-more/). Read about anything and everything and be open to seeing what you didn’t expect to be there–that’s how you find the best stuff. Shelby Foote, “I can’t begin to tell you the things I discovered while I was looking for something else.” If you need book recommendations, [these will help.](https://ryanholiday.net/reading-newsletter/)
            - -Mark down what sticks out at you as you read–passages, words, anecdotes, stories, info. When I read, I just fold the bottom corners of the pages. If I have a pen on me, I mark the particularly passages I want to come back to. I used to use [flag-it highlighters](http://www.staplespromotionalproducts.com/ProductDetail.aspx?id=7413&EXID=PS:GooglePLAs:50146&KPID=50146), which can be great.
            - -Again, take notes while you read. It’s what the best readers do, period. it’s called “[marginalia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marginalia).” For instance, [John Stuart Mill hated Ralph Waldo Emerson](https://www.historytoday.com/frank-prochaska/mills-and-emerson-sense-and-nonsense), and we know this based on his copies of Emerson’s books where he made those (private) comments. You can also see some of [Mark Twain’s fascinating marginalia here.](https://marktwainhouse.blogspot.com/2010/01/mark-twains-marginalia.html) Bill Gates’ marginalia is public on a website he keeps called [The Gates Notes.](http://www.thegatesnotes.com/Books) It’s a way to have a conversation with the book and the author. Don’t be afraid to judge, criticism or exclaim as you read.
            - -Wisdom, not facts. We’re not just looking random pieces of information. What’s the point of that? Your commonplace book, over a lifetime (or even just several years), can accumulate a mass of true wisdom–that you can turn to in times of crisis, opportunity, depression or job.
            - -But you have to read and approach reading accordingly. Montaigne once teased the writer Erasmus, who was known for his dedication to reading scholarly works, by asking with heavy sarcasm, “Do you think he is searching in his books for a way to become better, happier, or wiser?” In Montaigne’s mind, if he wasn’t, it was all a waste. A commonplace book is a way to keep our learning priorities in order. It motivates us to look for and keep only the [things we can use](https://corpvisionlife.net/cialis-generic-tadalafil.html).
            - -After you finish the book, put it down for a week or so. Let it percolate in your head. Now, return to it and review all the material you’ve saved and transfer the marginalia and passages to your commonplace book.
            - -It doesn’t have to just be material from books. Movies, speeches, videos, conversations work too. Whatever. Anything good.
            - -Actually writing the stuff down is crucial. I know it’s easier to keep a Google Doc or an Evernote project of your favorite quotes…but easy has got nothing to do with this. As Raymond Chandler put it, “When you have to use your energy to put those words down, you are more apt to make them count.” (Disclosure: for really long pieces, I’ll type it up and print it out).
            - -Technology is great, don’t get me wrong. But some things should take effort. Personally, I’d much rather adhere to the system that worked for guys like Thomas Jefferson than some cloud-based shortcut.
            - -That being said, I don’t think the “book” part is all that important, just that it is a physical resource of some kind. If you do want a book, [Moleskines](https://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&keywords=moleskine&linkCode=ur2&qid=1377630070&rh=n%3A1069756%2Ck%3Amoleskine&rnid=2941120011&tag=ryanholnet-20) are great and so are [Field Notes](https://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-keywords=fieldnotes&linkCode=ur2&rh=n%3A1064954%2Cn%3A1069242%2Cn%3A1069664%2Cn%3A1069756%2Ck%3Afieldnotes&tag=ryanholnet-20&url=node%3D1069756).
            - -I use 4×6 ruled index cards, which Robert Greene introduced me to. I [write the information on the card](http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/12/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-using-everything-you-read/), and the theme/category on the top right corner. As he figured out, being able to shuffle and move the cards into different groups is crucial to getting the most out of them. Ronald Reagan actually kept [quotes on a similar notecard system](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-05-08-reagan-notes-book-brinkley_n.htm).
            - -For bigger projects, I organize the cards [in these Cropper Hoppers](https://www.amazon.com/Cropper-Hopper-4-Inch-6-Inch-Purple/dp/B000S14TNA/ref=pd_sim_ac_3?tag=ryanholnet-20). It’s meant for storing photos, but it handles index cards perfectly (especially when you use [file dividers](https://www.amazon.com/Smead-Self-Tab-Manila-Guides-56030/dp/B0006HV3F8/ref=pd_sim_op_8?tag=ryanholnet-20)). Each of the books I have written gets its own hopper (and you can store papers/articles in the compartment below.
            - -These [Vaultz Index Card boxes](https://www.amazon.com/Vaultz-4x6-Index-Black-VZ01171/dp/B000GP0Z68/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1377530158&sr=8-1&keywords=vaultz+index+card+box&tag=ryanholnet-20) are also good for smaller projects (they have a lock and key as well).
            - -Don’t worry about organization…at least at first. I get a lot of emails from people asking me what categories I organize my notes in. Guess what? It doesn’t matter. The information I personally find is what dictates my categories. Your search will dictate your own. Focus on finding good stuff and the themes will reveal themselves.
            - -Some of my categories for those who are curious: Life. Death. [Writing](https://www.writingroutines.com/). Stoicism. Strategy. Animals. [Narrative Fallacy](https://ryanholiday.net/the-narrative-fallacy/). Books. Article Ideas. Education. [Arguing with Reality](https://ryanholiday.net/voting-on-reality/). Misc.
            - -Don’t let it pile up. A lot of people mark down passages or fold pages of stuff they like. Then they put of doing anything with it. I’ll tell you, nothing will make your procrastinate like seeing a giant pile of books you have to go through and take notes on it. You can avoid this by not letting it pile up. Don’t go months or weeks without going through the ritual. You have to stay on top of it.
            - -Because mine is a physical box with literally thousands of cards, I don’t carry the whole thing with me. But if I am working on a particular section of a book, I’ll take all those cards with me. Or when I was working on [my writing post for Thought Catalog](https://ryanholiday.net/how-and-why-to-keep-a-commonplace-book/www.ryanholiday.net/so-you-want-to-be-a-writer-thats-mistake-1/%E2%80%8E), I grabbed all the “writing” cards before I hopped on a flight and threw the post together while I was in the air.
            - -It doesn’t have to be just other people’s writing. One of my favorite parts of [The Crack Up](https://www.amazon.com/The-Crack-Up-F-Scott-Fitzgerald/dp/0811218201?tag=ryanholnet-20)–a mostly forgotten collection of materials from F. Scott Fitzgerald published after his death–is the random phrases and observations he made. They are aphorisms without the posturing that comes with writing for publication. So many of my notecards are just things that occurred to me, notes to myself in essence. It’s your book. Use it how you want.
            - –[Look at other people’s commonplace books](http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2013/08/everyone-should-keep-a-commonplace-book-great-tips-from-people-who-do/). It’s like someone is separating the wheat from the chaff for you. Try [a Google Books search for “Commonplace Book”](https://www.google.com/search?q=commonplace+book&btnG=Search+Books&tbm=bks&tbo=1#fp=8b07867c850d4b92&q=commonplace+book&safe=off&tbm=bks)–there is great stuff there.
            - -Use them! Look, my commonplace book is easily justified. I write and speak about things for a living. I need this resource. But so do you. You write papers, memos, emails, notes to friends, birthday cards, give advice, have conversations at dinner, console loved ones, tell someone special how you feel about them. All these are opportunities to use the wisdom you have come across and recorded–to improve what you’re doing with knowledge passed down through history.
            - -This is a project for a lifetime. I’ve been keeping my commonplace books in variety of forms for 6 or 7 years. But I’m just getting started.
            - -Protect it at all costs. As the historian Douglas Brinkley [said about Ronald Reagan’s collection](https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-05-08-reagan-notes-book-brinkley_n.htm) of notecards: “If the Reagans’ home in Palisades were burning, this would be one of the things Reagan would immediately drag out of the house. He carried them with him all over like a carpenter brings their tools. These were the tools for his trade.” I couldn’t have put it better myself.
            - -Start NOW. Don’t put this off until later. Don’t write me about how this is such a good idea and you wish you had the time to do it too. You do have the time. But start, now, and stop putting it off. Make it a priority. It will pay off. I promise.
            - If anyone wants to post photos of their Commonplace Book or describe their personal method–go for it (or [email it to me](mailto:ryan.holiday@gmail.com)).

    - This suggests to me that the system is incredibly robust if it can be so helpful even when a key feature has been disabled.
        - I agree with [[Sönke Ahrens]], however, whom I can summarize as recommending ABC: always be connecting.
            - The reason is that by connecting permanent notes, we are "prewriting." The threshold for writing a text has been lowered when entire sections of it have been laid out in advance.
                - #Reply-from [[Matt McKinlay]] Love the prewriting expression Mike! Captures much of the blank page problem discussed by Sonke
    - {{[[DONE]]}} write out the argument __against__ anything other than minimal tagging. (I am thinking it might rely heavily on how important it is to have an effective retrieval function in the slip box.)
        - ""The reason he was so economical with notes per keyword and why we too should be very selective lies in the way the slip-box is used. Because it should not be used as an archive, where we just take out what we put in, but as a system to think with, the references between the notes are much more important than the references from the index to a single note. Focusing exclusively on the index would basically mean that we always know upfront what we are looking for–we would have to have a fully developed plan in our heads. But liberating our brains from the task of organizing the notes is the main reason we use the slip-box in the first place." [*](((UjeoZyqmz)))" (Thanks to [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] for the tutorial on text and alias!)
            - "a link encourages surfing, Roaming, exploring serendipitous pathways, because in a densely linked slip box one note always leads to another. A [[tag]] can only take you from one note in the category to another note in the same category."
                - "it is more fruitful to explore weak ties across diverse fields than to stay within the silo defined by the [[tag]]"
        - #Reply-from [[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]] #Question   Do you use tags for archiving? Do you add links to related [[permanent notes]] and [[literature notes]] for discovery and [[Idea generation]]?
            - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]]This is all a work-in-progress for me, so I tend to defer to those who have been working in a Zettelkasten for years, compared to my monthslong experience. I have learned that I want a robust system that could still function if, like Luhmann, I had 90,000 permanent notes.
                - the consensus seems to be that tags should be used minimally and outline notes, or structure notes, or indexes, or notes that are lists of other notes, are the better way to go.
- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"How often do you feel overwhelmed by the process of creating your own [[Zettelkasten]]? What exactly are the sticking points that continue to resurface? How can you breakthrough those issues with a clearly drawn out plan? What are the steps you would show others to take, who deal with similar problems?"
    1. [[Kate Foy 🌱]] No, not overwhelmed at all by the process. If there is a sticking-point - more a challenge in a busy life - it's creating the habit of writing on a daily basis - my current discipline. By the way, props to [[~[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]] for his point (below) about whether a "group zettelkasten" is possible. Couldn't agree more. It's a fascinating exercise but (apart from the investigative/learning focus of the task) pointless, imho. There, I said it. 
    2.  
    3. [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] I can't say that I feel overwhelmed, on the contrary I think I've been enjoying the process of refinement.

One thing that really resonated with me was [[Wade Dominic]]'s quote - hold on a sec lemme find it ... actually Wade was riffing off [[Brandon Toner]] - here: "Having a galaxy brain moment here 🤯"

This to me gets at the absolute heart of what this process is about - something that in my own mind I've started calling "**atomic authorship**"

If a Zettel becomes an "assertion" - one that can later be "retracted" or "shaped" - then it is, in a purest sense, "mine" - it marks the boundary between my "responses" to a text (which are the fleeting notes in my mind, also according to [[Brandon Toner]]'s formulation.) - see: "Fleeting Notes:: "

Then the Zettelkasten, in part, becomes the engine for **consistenty defining and demarcating the boundaries between my own original thoughts, and those thoughts which I have, that are primarily either reactive or responsive to others** - which I think is a powerful and simple working definition for what it "affords". 

It also resolves the whole question, in my mind of whether a group Zettelkasten is even "possible" (IMO it isn't, or at least it is very much a different "kind" of thing - even though multiplayer graphs are cool and fun, I don't expect them to serve remotely the same "purpose".)

The rest in my opinion kind of consists of details, that I can sort out later ... which I find exciting.  Woo hoo! 🎉 🎉 🎉
        - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] in regards to group Zettlekasten, atomicity could potentially be abstracted to the individual level (but this is where the fun comes in, I agree it will have a life of its own just like any other collaboration!).  what might be possible in the next book club is pull our group slipbox forward and shape our permanent notes based on what we’ve already developed)
            - "#Chat [[Chinarut]] I poked into our original book club out of curiosity. How are we leveraging what was developed there and bringing these two books/slipboxes together? It’s absolutely clear to me a tremendous amount of brainthink goes into each of these graphs! I absolutely love [[Lindsey Johnston✨]]’s insight on how #multiplayer pans out & wondering to what degree we are reusing this:"
    4. 
    5. [[Denise Todd]] I'm not overwhelmed by the process but by the lost opportunity.  If I had started long ago (I'm a bit older than the average age of a ROAMer, I can't even imagine what more I could have accomplished! But as they say (whoever "they" are) — it's never too late. 

Sticking points? I'm still trying to absorb everything, but the hardest thing for me to grasp is Permanent Notes.  I've done literature reviews before so I've got that part.  Fleeting notes are, to me, more than what I've seen explained by many - but it works for me.  But Permanent Notes - hmmm, they make me go wonky. 🤪

My plan is two-fold.  One - to not worry about it.  I'll continue to do my version of fleeting notes, literature notes, and just let the permanent notes evolve organically.  Second - keep an open mind and review the practices of others and "borrow" what resonates with me. 

I'm in agreement with [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] above as to group Zettelkasten.  The whole process is so unique to what's important to me, what resonates to me - I'm hard-pressed to see a group Zettel working.  That said, there is something to benefit to "group think" in terms of widening your own thoughts and understanding the common denominator of many.

        - [[Denise Todd]] [[Question]] for [[Beau Haan]] or [[Chat]] for others  -- some of my [[Fleeting Notes]] are not specifically related to what I'm reading.  The reader just triggers a thought or question I'd like to follow up on later.  How would you all suggest that to be handled within ROAM?
