                - It gave me a chance to reflect on how I read and reassess if that is now the optimal way to do so.
            - "Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?"
                - I will try to change my habit of highlighting and once I develop a usable workflow, will try to form Zettels as I go along.
            - "Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?  "
                - Yes, although I expect it will be a slow go initially as this has taken 6 weeks for this book :)

- [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
    - In psychology, this is known as the **Dunning-Kruger** effect (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). That means that those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort, tend to underestimate their abilities.  Poor students of knowledge won’t have trouble finding confirming evidence in the literature as they usually lack both interest and skill to detect and think through dis-confirming facts and arguments. [*](((LTX79DEgy)))   This must be important as it is the second article I have read this week that mentioned this "effect"
    -  [[David Allen]]’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001). The principle of [[GTD]] is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. ...   Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. ... it does provide a structure for our everyday work that deals with the fact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds. [*](((ngW0psLUC)))      So the idea is to keep just a few important things in your conscious mind and not be distracted by the many little things  on your TODO list that you didn't get around to yet today.
    -  And this is the other insight of David Allen: Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand. [*](((wAz831-X5)))  As above, this must be the key to his system. Allow you

        - In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, "#quote ^^the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?^^" Most students sort their material by topic or even by seminars and semester. From the perspective of someone who writes, that makes as much sense as sorting your errands by purchase date and the store they were bought from. Can’t find your trousers? Maybe they are with the bleach you bought the same day at your department store. [*](((qjApgS0oM)))
            - #quote ^^the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?^^
            - fleeting note - The goal is to store a note in a manner that will allow you to most easily run into it in the future.
        - The slip-box is the shipping container of the academic world. Instead of having different storage for different ideas, everything goes into the same slip-box and is standardised into the same format. Instead of focusing on the in-between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published. The biggest advantage compared to a top-down storage system organised by topics is that the slip-box becomes more and more valuable the more it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing. If you sort by topic, you are faced with the dilemma of either adding more and more notes to one topic, which makes them increasingly hard to find, or adding more and more topics and subtopics to it, which only shifts the mess to another level. The first system is designed to find things you deliberately search for, putting all the responsibility on your brain. "#quote ^^The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.^^" [*](((EVjA9eABJ)))
            - #quote ^^The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering.^^
            - fleeting note - ** This is the key of the Zettelgast system, which is targeted towards insight that can be published. The function of the slip-box is to hold ideas that allow you to think rather than just remember.
        - ^^FLEETING NOTES would be highlighting, notes in margins, etc.^^
        - ^^PERMANENT (LITERATURE) NOTES will be kept; these are the important thoughts one should formulate when reading; should be short and are there to facilitate writing Zettels for the slip-box.^^
        - As it is not possible to foresee the development of the slip-box, the fate of the notes is nothing to worry about. In contrast to the fleeting notes, every permanent note for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece, but that can not be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments. "#quote ^^The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.^^" [*](((UZ4XCHfSA)))
            - #quote ^^The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.^^
        - ZETTELS contain the actual thought in written form and are not just reminders keeping in mind that it is desirable to store these in a way that will most easily be connected to.
        - PROJECT NOTES can include comments, outlines, drafts and reminders related to a single project.
        - **ZETTEL** - Notes from a book should promote ideas and thinking about how they can relate to other ideas, strengthening the bonds of knowledge and promoting growth and thought.

        - "Any attempts to trick ourselves into work with external rewards (like doing something nice after finishing a chapter) are only short-term solutions with no prospect of establishing a positive feedback loop. These are very fragile motivational constructions. Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward (DePasque and Tricomi, 2015)."

        - The extraordinary successful fitness motivation coach Michelle Segar uses this dynamic to turn even the most stubborn couch potatoes into exercise aficionados (Segar, 2015). She brings those who really don’t like exercise but know they have to do it into a sustainable workout routine by focusing on one thing: Creating satisfying, repeatable experiences with sports. It doesn’t matter what her clients are doing–running, walking, team sports, gym workouts or bicycling to work. The only thing that matters is that they discover something that gives them a good experience that they would like to have again. Once her clients find something, they are encouraged enough to try something else as well. They enter the virtuous circle where willpower isn’t needed anymore because they feel like doing it anyway. If they tried to trick themselves into exercise by rewarding themselves afterwards with a relaxed evening on the sofa watching TV, it wouldn’t have taken them long until they went straight for the sofa, skipping the workout altogether, because this is how we tick. [*](((ZLooaikXs)))
        - 
        - Feedback loops are not only crucial for the dynamics of motivation, but also the key element to any learning process. Nothing motivates us more than the experience of becoming better at what we do. And the only chance to improve in something is getting timely and concrete feedback. "#quote ^^Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn^^, or in the more general terms of psychologist Carol Dweck, to grow. Dweck shows convincingly that ^^the most reliable predictor for long-term success is having a “growth mindset.”^^ To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (and happiness) in the long run." Conversely, nothing is a bigger hindrance to personal growth than having a “fixed mindset.” Those who fear and avoid feedback because it might damage their cherished positive self-image might feel better in the short term, but will quickly fall behind in actual performance (Dweck 2006; 2013). Ironically, it is therefore often the highly gifted and talented students, who receive a lot of praise, who are more in danger of developing a fixed mindset and getting stuck. Having been praised for what they are (talented and gifted) rather than for what they do, they tend to focus on keeping this impression intact, rather than exposing themselves to new challenges and the possibility of learning from failure. Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding). The orientation towards the latter makes one stick to safe, proven areas. The orientation towards the first draws the attention to the areas most in need of improvement. "#quote ^^To seek as many opportunities to learn as possible is the most reliable long-term growth strategy.^^" And if growth and success are not reasons enough, then maybe the fact that the fear of failure has the ugliest name of all phobias: Kakorrhaphiophobia. [*](((AR7OaXAvj)))

        - Having a growth mindset is crucial, but only one side of the equation. "#quote ^^Having a learning system in place that enables feedback loops in a practical way is equally important.^^" Being open for feedback doesn’t help very much if the only feedback you can get comes once every few months for work you have already finished. The linear model of academic writing comes with very few feedback opportunities, and even those are usually spread out over time (vgl. Fritzsche, Young und Hickson, 2003). If you choose a topic for your paper and work according to the linear model, you will only learn if your choice was wise after multiple stages of research. The same applies to the question of if you understood what you read and if your idea for an argument makes sense. [*](((fAEc5q4n4)))
            - #quote ^^Having a learning system in place that enables feedback loops in a practical way is equally important.^^
        - Our brains work not that differently in terms of interconnectedness. Psychologists used to think of the brain as a limited storage space that slowly fills up and makes it more difficult to learn late in life. "#quote ^^But we know today that the more connected information we already have, the easier it is to learn, because new information can dock to that information.^^" Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or “latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information. That makes it easier not only to learn and remember, but also to retrieve the information later in the moment and context it is needed. [*](((E6qEFWAIg)))

    - [[Chapter 9. Separate the Interlocking Tasks]]
        - "#quote ^^When it comes to focused attention, we focus on one thing only, something we can sustain for only a few seconds.^^" The maximum duration of focused attention seems not to have changed over time (Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013, 91). Focused attention is different from “sustained attention,” which we need to stay focused on one task for a longer period and is necessary to learn, understand or get something done. This is the kind of attention that is most certainly under threat from an increase in distractions. The average duration seems to have shrunken quite considerably over time–we practice much less focused attention than we used to (ibid). [*](((UHcHGWMNj)))
            - #quote ^^When it comes to focused attention, we focus on one thing only, something we can sustain for only a few seconds.^^
            - fleeting note - We need to focus attention, avoid distraction and try not to multi task
        - Psychologists used to associate scientific work exclusively with focused attention, while other, more floating kinds of attention were exclusively associated with creative work like art. We know today that we need both kinds of attention for art and science. It is not surprising, therefore, that this flexibility can be found among most, if not all, exceptional scientists. Oshin Vartanian compared and analysed the daily workflows of Nobel Prize winners and other eminent scientists and concluded that it is not a relentless focus, but flexible focus that distinguishes them. "“Specifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can #quote ^^alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas.^^ This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible strategy application in relation to task demands.”" (Vartanian 2009, 57) [*](((sT8GoIPxY)))
            - “Specifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can #quote ^^alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas.^^ This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible strategy application in relation to task demands.”
            - fleeting note - problem solving involves focused attention and creative exploration of ideas
        - Attention is not our only limited resource. Our short-term memory is also limited. We need strategies not to waste its capacity with thoughts we can better delegate to an external system. While the estimations of our long-term memory capacity are wildly diverse and rather speculative, psychologists used to tend to agree on a very specific number when it came to short-term memory: "#quote ^^We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time^^", plus/ minus two (Miller 1956). [*](((xyY0jdDXR)))
            - #quote ^^We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time^^
            - fleeting note - We can only hold 7 things in short term memory, then they are either forgotten, replaced by something else or shifted to long-term memory
        - This is why it is so much easier to remember things we understand than things we don’t. It is not that we have to choose to focus either on learning or understanding. It is always about understanding–and if it is only for the sake of learning. "#quote ^^Things we understand are connected^^, either through rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations. ^^And deliberately building these kinds of meaningful connections is what the slip-box is all about.^^" [*](((3u90h1h1x)))
            - #quote ^^Things we understand are connected^^, either through rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations. ^^And deliberately building these kinds of meaningful connections is what the slip-box is all about.^^
            - fleeting note - It is easier to remember things we understand as it connects them to other items in stored memory - that is what the slip-box should do
        - Zeigarnik successfully reproduced what is now known as the Zeigarnik effect: Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory–until they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance. But thanks to Zeigarnik’s follow-up research, we also know that we don’t actually have to finish tasks to convince our brains to stop thinking about them. All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of. That’s right: The brain doesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. "#quote ^^By writing something down, we literally get it out of our heads. This is why David Allen’s “Getting things done” system works^^": The secret to have a “mind like water” is to get all the little stuff out of our short-term memory. And as we can’t take care of everything once and for all right now, the only way to do that is to have a reliable external system in place where we can keep all our nagging thoughts about the many things that need to be done and trust that they will not be lost. [*](((E4Y2AJaeT)))
            - #quote ^^By writing something down, we literally get it out of our heads. This is why David Allen’s “Getting things done” system works^^
            - fleeting note - open tasks occupy short-term memory until they are done. We don't need to finish task but need to reassign it (GTD. David Allen)
            - literature note (combining above fleeting notes) - Focused attention and creative thought should be rewarded with a permanent note to moves the thoughts out of our limited short-term memory
            - Zettel - Focused thought and a creative approach can help distill the author's presentation into a meaningful Zettel.
            - Zettel - These Zettels can free up our short-term moving our idea into our long-term memory with the slip-box but should be stored in a manner that will increase the likelihood of us coming across it as we continue to read other material in the future.
        - Conversely, we can use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage by deliberately keeping unanswered questions in our mind. We can ruminate about them, even when we do something that has nothing to do with work and ideally does not require our full attention. "#quote ^^Letting thoughts linger without focusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in a different, often surprisingly productive way.^^" While we have a walk or a shower or clean the house, the brain cannot help but play around with the last unsolved problem it came across. And that is why we so often find the answer to a question in rather casual situations. [*](((tRi4T9gqd)))
            - #quote ^^Letting thoughts linger without focusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in a different, often surprisingly productive way.^^
            - fleeting note - we can purposefully keep unanswered questions in our mind to ponder while doing other activities
            - literature note - Sometimes it is desired to keep an idea in our short-term memory to ponder before assigning to long-term memory or discarding
        - Even though results of these studies are currently under intense scrutiny and have to be taken with a grain of salt (Carter and McCullough 2014; Engber and Cauterucci 2016; Job, Dweck and Walton 2010), it is safe to argue that a reliable and standardised working environment is less taxing on our attention, concentration and willpower, or, if you like, ego. "#quote ^^It is well known that decision-making is one of the most tiring and wearying tasks^^", which is why people like Barack Obama or Bill Gates only wear two suit colours: dark blue or dark grey. This means they have one less decision to make in the morning, leaving more resources for the decisions that really matter. [*](((GA_-GRwmF)))
            - #quote ^^It is well known that decision-making is one of the most tiring and wearying tasks^^
            - fleeting note - Why is this??
            - literature note - This seems like a subject for more exploration
        - Being able to finish a task in a timely manner and to pick up the work exactly where we left it has another enjoyable advantage that helps to restore our attention: We can have breaks without fear of losing the thread. "#quote ^^Breaks are much more than just opportunities to recover. They are crucial for learning. They allow the brain to process information, move it into long-term memory and prepare it for new information^^" ([[Doyle and Zakrajsek 2013]], 69).[ 23] If we don’t give ourselves a break in between work sessions, be it out of eagerness or fear of forgetting what we were doing, it can have a detrimental effect on our efforts. To have a walk (Ratey, 2008) or even a nap[ 24] supports learning and thinking.[ 25] [*](((LhfTAVsR5)))
            - #quote ^^Breaks are much more than just opportunities to recover. They are crucial for learning. They allow the brain to process information, move it into long-term memory and prepare it for new information^^
            - fleeting note - breaks are important
        - Zettel?  Reading for knowledge requires not only focused attention but a sportful attempt to connect the information to ideas and thoughts already stored in our memory and slipbox.

        - "#quote While the literature notes will be stored within the reference system together with the bibliographic details, separate from the slip-box, but still close to the context of the original text, ^^they are already written with an eye towards the lines of thoughts within the slip-box.^^" #quote ^^Luhmann describes this step as follows: “I always have a slip of paper at hand, on which I note down the ideas of certain pages. On the backside I write down the bibliographic details. After finishing the book I go through my notes and think how these notes might be relevant for already written notes in the slip-box. It means that I always read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 150)^^ [*](((7kgUv6PAe)))

            - fleeting note - reflect on what is NOT mentioned as well as what is mentioned

        - There is no secret to it and the explanation is pretty simple: Handwriting is slower and can’t be corrected as quickly as electronic notes. Because students can’t write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. But to be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in the first place. "#quote ^^So if you are writing by hand, you are forced to think about what you hear (or read)–otherwise you wouldn’t be able to grasp the underlying principle, the idea, the structure of an argument.^^" Handwriting makes pure copying impossible, but instead facilitates the translation of what is said (or written) into one’s own words. The students who typed into their laptops were much quicker, which enabled them to copy the lecture more closely but circumvented actual understanding. They focused on completeness. Verbatim notes can be taken with almost no thinking, as if the words are taking a short cut from the ear to the hand, bypassing the brain. [*](((fxe-n8Txn)))
            - #quote ^^So if you are writing by hand, you are forced to think about what you hear (or read)–otherwise you wouldn’t be able to grasp the underlying principle, the idea, the structure of an argument.^^
        - literature note - Writing a note by hand forces one to think about what one is saying to put it into one's own words. The benefit from writing may not be just from writing but from consciously thinking about what one is writing.  That is to say, that perhaps one could achieve the same result by digitally typing an idea down rather than writing it as long as one has put the idea into ones own words allowing for actual understanding.
        - fleeting note - Verbatim notes can be typed quickly as almost no thought is required. (but not helpful)
        - fleeting note - Confirmation bias - We are drawn to what confirms what we already believe we know. Being aware of it is the best we can hope for.
        - **ZETTEL** - As we read we should strive to be aware that we have biases that will draw us to focus on what we already know or believe to be true.

            - #quote ^^Developing arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of top-down is the first and most important step to opening ourselves up for insight.^^
            - literature note - Bottom-up thinking can help reduce confirmation bias.
                - Confirm that we have separated tasks and are focused on understanding the text
                - Make sure we have a true account of the content

            - **ZETTEL** -  These should connect to or be open to connections.  We want information that can add something and enrich the slip-box.  Don't add extraneous information.

        - But this dynamic can only start if we ourselves deliberately decide to take on the task of reading and being selective about it, relying on nothing other than "#quote ^^our own judgement of what is important and what is not^^". Textbooks or secondary literature in general cannot take this off our hands, and students who solely rely on them have no chance of becoming “worldly wise.” This is not far off from what philosopher Immanuel Kant described in his famous text about the Enlightenment: “Nonage [immaturity] is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s own mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) "#quote ^^‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.” (Kant 1784)^^") [*](((wzyxLhq_8)))

            - literature note - What matters are your thoughts and how you perceive the information as it relates to your world and you should try to understand what is presented in your terms of understanding and perspective and question what is said and not hold everything as fact, but rather the author's presentation.

        - While it is obvious that familiarity is not understanding, we have no chance of knowing whether we understand something or just believe we understand something until we test ourselves in some form. If we don’t try to verify our understanding during our studies, we will happily enjoy the feeling of getting smarter and more knowledgeable while in reality staying as dumb as we were. This warm feeling disappears quickly when we try to explain what we read in our own words in writing. Suddenly, we see the problem. "#quote ^^The attempt to rephrase an argument in our own words confronts us without mercy with all the gaps in our understanding. It certainly feels less good, but this struggle is the only chance we have to improve our understanding, to learn and move forward^^" (cf. below). This, again, is deliberate practice. Now we are faced with a clear choice: We have to choose between feeling smarter or becoming smarter. And while writing down an idea feels like a detour, extra time spent, not writing it down is the real waste of time, as it renders most of what we read as ineffectual. [*](((5pGdRqCEM)))

        - Understanding is not just a precondition to learning something. To a certain degree, learning is understanding. And the mechanisms are not so different, either: We can only improve our learning if we test ourselves on our progress. Here, too, #quote ^^rereading or reviewing does not confront us with the things we haven’t learned yet, although it makes us feel like we have. ((ut7VNyT_o)).^^ [*](((hffwZywwQ))) The mere-exposure effect would fool us here, too: Seeing something we have seen before causes the same emotional reaction as if we had been able to retrieve the information from our memory. Rereading, therefore, makes us feel we have learned what we read: “I know that already!” Our brains are terrible teachers in this regard. We face here the same choice between methods that make us feel like we learned something and methods that truly do make us learn something. [*](((gPZsuV0dj)))

        - “The principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool,” Feynman stressed in a speech to young scientists (Feynman 1985, 342). Reading, especially rereading, can easily fool us into believing we understand a text. "#quote ^^Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it.

                    - Writing a note by hand forces one to think about what one is saying to put it into one's own words. The benefit from writing may not be just from writing but from consciously thinking about what one is writing.  That is to say, that perhaps one could achieve the same result by digitally typing an idea down rather than writing it as long as one has put the idea into ones own words allowing for actual understanding.

                    - permanent literature notes should be written with the thought of a Zettel in mind
                    - problem solving involves focused attention and creative exploration of ideas
                    - Verbatim notes can be typed quickly as almost no thought is required. (but not helpful)

    - [[Chapter 11. Take Smart Notes]]
        - Experienced academic readers usually read a text with questions in mind and try to relate it to other possible approaches, while inexperienced readers tend to adopt the question of a text and the frames of the argument and take it as a given. "#quote ^^What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text.^^" [*](((x8xsQz6Ns)))
            - #quote ^^What good readers can do is spot the limitations of a particular approach and see what is not mentioned in the text.^^
            - fleeting note - What hasn't been mentioned?  Are both sides presented? Is there supporting data? Does what the writer says make sense? Do you agree?  Are they overlooking things or simplifying them?
            - 
        - As we write notes with an eye towards existing notes, we take more into account than the information that is already available in our internal memory. That is extremely important, because the internal memory retrieves information not in a rational or logical way, but according to psycho-logical rules. The brain also doesn’t store information neurally and objectively. We reinvent and rewrite our memory every time we try to retrieve information. The brain works with rules of thumb and makes things look as if they fit, even if they don’t. It remembers events that never happened, connects unrelated episodes to convincing narratives and completes incomplete images. It cannot help but see patterns and meaning everywhere, even in the most random things (cf. Byrne, 2008). "#quote ^^The brain, as Kahneman writes, is “a machine for jumping to conclusions”^^" (Kahneman, 2013, 79). And a machine that is designed for jumping to conclusions is not the kind of machine you want to rely on when it comes to facts and rationality–at least, you would want to counterbalance it. Luhmann states as clearly as possible: it is not possible to think systematically without writing (Luhmann 1992, 53). Most people still think about thinking as a purely internal process, and believe that the only function of the pen is to put finished thoughts on paper. Richard Feynman once had a visitor in his office, a historian who wanted to interview him. When he spotted Feynman’s notebooks, he said how delighted he was to see such “wonderful records of Feynman’s thinking.” [*](((BernhIBab)))
            - #quote ^^The brain, as Kahneman writes, is “a machine for jumping to conclusions”^^
            - fleeting note - This is the best quote in the book!
        - fleeting note - by writing down our thoughts we externalize and ask how these can apply, affect or interact with other ideas
        - "#quote ^^Transferring ideas into the external memory also allows us to forget them.^^" And even though it sounds paradoxical, forgetting actually facilitates long-term learning. It is important to understand why, because there are still many students who shy away from using an external memory. They fear that they would have to choose between remembering things in their heads (which wouldn’t require an external memory) or in the external memory (which then would be forgotten in the internal memory). That this is a false choice becomes obvious as soon as we understand how our memory truly works. [*](((wz1tMENoR)))
            - #quote ^^Transferring ideas into the external memory also allows us to forget them.^^
            - fleeting note - transferring into long-term memory frees up our mind.  The subconscious mechanism of inhibition creates a  mental barrier  between conscious mind and long-term memory.
        - Robert and Elizabeth Ligon Bjork from the University of California suggest distinguishing between two different measurements when it comes to memory: Storage strength and retrieval strength (Bjork 2011). They speculate that "#quote ^^storage strength, the ability to store memories, only becomes greater over one’s lifetime.^^" We add more and more information to our long-term memory. Just by looking at the physical capacity of our brains, we can see that we could indeed probably store a lifetime and a bit of detailed experiences in it (Carey 2014, 42). [*](((J0FDxuUyD)))
            - #quote ^^storage strength, the ability to store memories, only becomes greater over one’s lifetime.^^
            - 
        - "#quote ^^If we instead focus on “retrieval strength,” we instantly start to think strategically about what kind of cues should trigger the retrieval of a memory. There are no natural cues: Every piece of information can become the trigger for another piece of information.^^" These can be associations like the scent of a sweet, as the madeleine triggered childhood memories for Proust, but this kind of flashback is called “involuntary memory” for a reason: we can’t retrieve it on purpose. Then there are the accidental cues that become attached to information when we learn something in a particular environment. It is, for example, easier to remember something we have learned in school if we are tested for it in the same room with the same noise in the background (Bjork 2011, 14). Likewise, sometimes it is difficult to remember something from school when we are not sitting in the classroom where we learned it. [*](((pZPxO9lYf)))

            - 
        - #quote ^^What does help for true, useful learning is to connect a piece of information to as many meaningful contexts as possible, which is what we do when we connect our notes in the slip-box with other notes. Making these connections deliberately means building up a self-supporting network of interconnected ideas and facts that work reciprocally as cues for each other. ^^[*](((29l608MMw)))
        - THIS IS IMPORTANT!!! 
        - The challenge of writing as well as learning is therefore not so much to learn, but to understand, as we will already have learned what we understand. The problem is that the meaning of something is not always obvious and needs to be explored. That is why we need to elaborate on it. "#quote ^^But elaboration is nothing more than connecting information to other information in a meaningful way. The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well.^^" [*](((TG5v6IOas)))

        - When we delegate the storage of knowledge to the slip-box and at the same time focus on the principles behind an idea while we write, add and connect notes, "#quote ^^when we look for patterns and think beyond the most obvious interpretation of a note, when we try to make sense of something, combine different ideas and develop lines of thought, we do exactly that: we build up a “latticework of mental models” instead of just “remembering isolated facts and try and bang ’em back.”^^" [*](((rrSp1EqGy)))

        - fleeting note - Mental models are useful
        - The beauty of this approach is that we co-evolve with our slip-boxes: we build the same connections in our heads while we deliberately develop them in our slip-box–and make it easier to remember the facts as they now have a latticework we can attach them to.

The slip-box not only provides us with the opportunity to learn in this proven way, it forces us to do exactly what is recommended just by using it.^^ We have to elaborate on what we read just to be able to write it down and translate it into different contexts. We retrieve information from the slip-box whenever we try to connect new notes with old notes. Just by doing this, we mix up contexts, shuffle notes and retrieve the information in irregular intervals. And along the way, we further elaborate on the information, which we always retrieve deliberately. [*](((3alXROjys)))
            - THIS QUOTE PRETTY MUCH SUMS IT ALL UP!!
        - Our brains just love routines. Before new information prompts our brains to think differently about something, they make the new information fit into the known or let it disappear completely from our perception. "#quote ^^Usually, we don’t even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to make it fit its expectations. We need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinking routines. In their book with the showy title “The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking”, the mathematicians Edward B. Burger and Michael Starbird collected different strategies to do that (2012).^^" Some are already technically implemented in the slip-box, others are good to keep in mind. [*](((6JKyVrlqX)))

            - It's trying to switch from Fleeing Notes to Fleeting Notes, if we don't make it a habit of immediately catching our thoughts onto a sustainable format we will lose most of them like we lose and forget our dreams
            - Today we have no excuse to refrain from this habit as it's never been easier, on the one hand we have easy capture tools on the other hands we have tools that will transfer our highlights, references and thoughts from one platform to another without any friction, think about #Roam and #Readwise
            - We have to transit from a previous habit to a new habit, this takes time, and a commitment from ourselves to ourselves

- [[Live Session 7]]
    - "You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say? "
        - That would depend on how much time they have.  Zettelkasten is a method of reading so that one can summarize an author's message in a way that is clearly understood and can be communicated to others and easily retrieved as needed.
    - "Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?"
        - Yes it did - It slowed it down tremendously :)  I think now I am more aware of general themes the author is trying to communicate to me and also now consciously aware of how these might tie in to other topics, threads or conversations from the same or other sources.
    - "The book promotes a bottom up approach to note taking, which we have used in Book Club. Reflect on this. How did this feel? "
        - It feel different at first.  Now I can see the merits of thinking that way. Having said that, however, I can appreciate Sonke's suggestion last week that perhaps it is best thought of as a combination of both top-down and bottom-up approach.
        - 
    - "What's your favourite blocks (or quotes) from the book?"
        - "The brain, as Kahneman writes, is 'a machine for jumping to conclusions'."
        - 
    - "Comment on your impressions of the shared graph"
        - I found it most helpful to be able to look at some other graphs to see new ways of looking at some of the ideas and to see how others are processing the same sections of the book.
    - "Have we finished? Do you feel you have clarity about the Zettelkasten process in Roam? "
        - I think I still need to fine-tune my Zettels into permanent notes and most importantly, need to find the right way to tie them into my threads of conversation to be stumbled upon later.  I think this will be the most difficult task yet for me.  So I don't yet feel finished.
    - ""Q: What were the most effective and/or useful conventions arrived at for making multiplayer work in the club?""
        - The breakout sessions were quite helpful to be able to discuss things in a much smaller group.
    - "Reflect on Roam Book Club"
        - This was quite worthwhile for me as a newer Roam user.  I struggled in the beginning to become familiar with some of the technical aspects of Roam such as which keys to click, etc.  I am more comfortable with that now but far from proficient.  Some kind of "manual" for the format might be helpful for any possible upcoming Roam book clubs.  In addition, we are all using Roam for somewhat different purposes and perhaps a way to group participants with similar goals, some of the time would be helpful if that is at all possible.
        - How can we output this information into our personal graphs?
