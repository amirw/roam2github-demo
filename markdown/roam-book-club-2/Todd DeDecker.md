        - I've read the first two sections and have watched several videos on note taking and how others have implemented the concepts. For me, a few specific things I want to take away from the process:
            - Continue to #[[work out loud]] 
                - Doing the writing as part of this book club encourages this behavior
                    - Forcing function as a matter of fact
            - Engage with an awesome community in a way I have not done before
                - This actually builds on the a few other things I've been done
                    - #roamcult on Twitter
                    - Classes that develop community

                - Learn from others
                    - Such a broad group - can't wait to see where this goes
            - Take great notes!
                - Quality over quantity
                - Leverage the full process
                    - Not just highlighting sections and never coming back
                    - This is tricky - it will clearly take time and energy to do this consistently
                    - Looking to build it into a habit
            - Do something with those notes!
                - Have a purpose for this work
                - I have taken notes and highlighted books my whole life
                    - Other than for a class, I have not taken that next step to do something meaningful with the notes and knowledge
                - I did a presentation for my broader group at #work on this 
                    - Really a discussion as we started a book club
                    - I'm planning on following it up with another session a few weeks in
            - Refine my broader system
                - Ideas and notes from everywhere
                - Processed and done in a way that I can find them and they make future connections
        - This will force me to add a bit more consistency to my reading
            - But looking forward to this approach to a book club

    - ""He not only stressed that he never forced himself to do something he didn’t feel like, he even said: “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f.)" - p. 15"
