        - I still want to review the book deeply...  just need more time;
        - I'm looking forward to get to learn about #[[Relevant Notes]]
        - I had an amazing session with [[@Beau Haan]] and we walked me through the creation of my first Zettel. It was mind blowing and I practice it this week on my daily work and decision making. It has been live changing.
- #[[Zettles]] [[Structure helps task execution and overcomes distraction. It also helps my hungry brain to feel fulfilled by only one task, instead of multitasking. The extra attention I devote to keep the structure helps me keep the focus on the subject I'm working on.]]
- #[[Literature Notes]] [Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know](((59-bYYcu-)))
    - A good structure brings flow to a task execution.
    - Author claims that a good structure can help with issues of procrastination and motivation
- #[[Fleeting Notes]] It seems that author claims that good structure may help him like just any content and I'm curious if this is the claim of the book or not.
    - I find a bit over the top the quote about not forcing himself to do anything he didn't want to.
    - indeed, I agree with the book that a good structure makes a process with less friction, and therefore a greater flow of thoughts
    - as opposed to what the text says, I am afraid that the level of detail may lead to the lost of sight of the big picture.
