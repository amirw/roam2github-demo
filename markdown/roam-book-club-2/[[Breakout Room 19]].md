- hi this is an experiment
- Hi Andre, this is Lars writing
    - Is it just us?
    - I think there are four of us in the "room"
- do you guys have any questions about the stuff [[Matt McKinlay]] said?
- [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]]
    - I am quite new to all of this
    - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] Lars don't worry we're all figuring out a lot of this as we go
        - What are we supposed to do now? 
        - I am just reading the guidelines
- 1st useful step is probably just to set up a home page for yourself, put whatever into it
    - so the official "task" for the breakout rooms is to come up with a question or questions for [[S√∂nke Ahrens]]
    - Ah, okay. 
    - [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]] Have you already read the book? @Matt
    - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] yes I have, but even if not, if you have any questions about the book's theme or what it's about that's still going to be useful
    - read it Lars?
    - [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]] No, I have heard about it the first time about two weeks ago from the person that introduced me tro Roam. 
    - [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]] Was the book written with Roam in mind? 
        - How does S√∂nke see the implementation the principles and methods in the book in Roam? Does he use other tools that he finds more useful? "Who went through the effort to turn the book into a Roam graph"? Was is a lot of effort to turn the book into a Roam Graph?
            - Who went through the effort to turn the book into a Roam graph
- right on
- are you broadly familiar with the concept of "Zettelkasten" which I think is the book's theme?
    - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] yeah I am also wondering how much [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] has played around with Roam, too
    - Wow, emojis? :D
    - 
- "template üß©: report back from small group"
    - Breakout Group Number - 19
        - Who was in this group on 11.1.20:: [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]]
        - What did your group talk about?::
            - haha we faced significant technical difficulties, took whole convo into database
        - Any questions for the book club as a whole?::
        - Our group question for S√∂nke Ahrens:: Nikolas Luhmann gets a lot of the attention for his techniques, are there other really important or significant historical note-takers we might benefit from studying
(#[[question for Soenke]])
- [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]]
    - How did you just do that? The template? 
        - Never mind. 
- 
- he started using it at least a few months back
- 
- [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]] pretty sure the book pre-dates Roam
    - interestingly, not by that much though - 2017 is the pub date for HTTsN
    - Conor had the alpha version up an running summer of 2019 I think is when Roam was up in early form
- re: "Who went through the effort to turn the book into a Roam graph"
    - I think we have it more in a basic, markdown form with maybe paragraph breaks at most
    - part of the project of the book club is to explore whether, in fact, a richer representation of the book might be possible
- I just noticed I think we are now the only people left in the breakout room!
    - Sorry that I cannot unmute myself. Didn't actually expect this to be so engaging.
        - I will figure out something else for next time
    - Yes, me too.
    -  
- [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]]
    - Could you summarise the concept of Zettelkasten for me in a few quick bullets?
