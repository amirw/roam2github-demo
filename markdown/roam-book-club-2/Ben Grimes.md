        - Benefits of written notes vs. digital notes
            - Act of writing help with retention
            - Analogue tools are screen-free, so limits distractions
            - Roam helps remove friction of using the notes
            - On balance, there is more benefit with digital notes than paper
        - How does routine fit into the Zettlekasten method; what is your routine?
            - No routine yet with the use of Roam
            - Techniques and routines vary, based on the need and questions at hand
            - "Being flexible is more important than being [too rigid in a routine]"
        - How does it feel to have become "the Patron Saint of Roam" and an inspiration to its development?
            - It's nice to have written something that feels to have been useful to people
        - What do you think about building a Zettlekasten in Roam?
            - The book is focused on principles and ideas, making it easier to apply to Roam
            - Roam allows you to write much longer notes, because of the granular use of the block reference
            - Another thing that is often misunderstood is note sequences, where he might write them all in a single note (multiple perspectives on a giving issue or argument), but separate new ideas (rather than explanation on a current idea) into a new note
            - Use of hastags# as index markers within notes, to create sort of collection boxes of similar notes.   These would be treated differently from a more traditional long-title note, which would be used for node and cluster analysis
        - had to duck out early, after just an hour
