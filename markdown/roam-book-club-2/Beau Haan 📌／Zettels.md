1. Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note[*](((hG7TRPF5I)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Is not story-telling an intellectual endeavor?
2. What they all have in common, though, is that they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper[*](((baDCUDIxD)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This is exactly the same sentiment in screen-writing books
3. how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way[*](((baDCUDIxD)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] And to give those written pieces/scenes a depth that this world has never seen before
4. #[[Relevant Notes]] [[Blank Page]]
    - #Zettels [[Having a practical note-taking system alleviates the biggest struggle when writing--the blank page]]
        - #[[Reference Notes]] [Introduction, Paragraph 7](((VQiKWP6bz)))
        - #[[Literature Notes]] The physical limitations of attempting to juggle the infinite threads of thought, allows for a system that is practical and eliminates the problem of a blank page
            - Avoiding the ever-present blank screen before beginning the writing process, can be mitigated by having a system that allows for an assembly of items through a [[Zettelkasten]]
            - Attempting to juggle the multiple threads of ideas is impossible 
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This reminds me of [[Rich Hickey]] talking about juggling code, and how there's a literal physical limitation no matter how skilled
5.  “I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.”[*](((59-bYYcu-)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This is the basis of creativity. The foundation of insight
6. #[[Relevant Notes]] [[Structure]]
    - "#[[Blank Page]] [[Having a practical note-taking system alleviates the biggest struggle when writing--the blank page]]"
    - #Zettels [[A system that provides a simplified chunking of complex concepts, gives users a structure that they can depend on, developing trust and habit]]
        - #[[Reference Notes]] [Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know, Paragraph 2](((N9B8GYzJr)))
        - #[[Literature Notes]] Building trust in a system happens when the complexity of the problem of knowing how to store things becomes simplified through activating the incentive reward system
            - The ability to chunk down something far more complex than it's individual simpler tasks, reinforces the trust since the results are seen consistently
            - Becoming immobilized from overwhelm is only mitigated when the incentive reward system is activated, and having a system that functions how you want it to, without having to think about it, opens that door
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This reminds me of GPS, and the importance of or knowing where you are and how trusting in that orientation by having their trust in that orientation allows one to not worry about the driving directions or the destination you get to enjoy the process, wow!

        - #[[Literature Notes]] Enabling flow where thinking is principle, allows for the tool to disappear, and the thoughts to become crystallized
            - Creating a dependable system that exhibits trust in the process enables flow, where we're no longer thinking about where to write, or even the tool that we're using, but we can just focus on the most important task at hand--writing!
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Just like an acting performance, and the inner-work prior to the rehearsals. It’s what [[Ivana Chubbuck]] talks about all the time. Flow!
8. where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement–which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception.[*](((e5t8EGtoY)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Exactly! Every day is another day within this journey that is life. It’s effervescent and ephemeral.

        - #[[Reference Notes]] [Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know, Paragraph 4](((e5t8EGtoY)))
        - #[[Literature Notes]] The limitations of planning is the presupposition of knowing what the outcome is, the power of insight is allowing that curiosity to lead you to around the bend of your own awareness
            - There is a strong delineation between structure and planning
            - Structure if done correctly, is confining the process in order to produce insights
            - Planning in any form, is results-oriented which eventually leads to conscientiousness being tested, instead of encountering the unexpected 
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This is exactly what it means to rehearse something and then letting it go before the actual performance of filming--it's exactly the same fucking thing!

        - #[[Literature Notes]] There's a sense of dread that hangs over the thoughtless pursuit of what does not interest us, this sort of answer seeking, makes what sparks our true interests seem absolutely what we would spend our lives doing 
            - Expertise in a field is predicated on the joys of the job of seeking insight, which is rewarding
            - Compared to the willpower it takes for planners to complete an exam, only to be glad that the arduous journey is over with
            - There's a problem when the system of education instills finding answers rather than finding truths
            - Answers can be planned for, truths have to be built upon
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The solution for the educational system, poisoned, through no ill-will, our basic nature of curiosity, immobilizing us from seeking truths--rather having us seeking answers
            - I don't ever want to do things that don't bring me to life
            - There's such a disconnect with doing things we enjoy compared to doing things just to get it done and over with
            - There has to be some sort of reasoning for this
            - I'm reminded of our history
                - How did we learn before the indoctrination of the factory sytem
                    - Filled with bells and alarms
                        - Clocks with timecards
                        - Whistles that tell us that we are on time or late
                        - Orderly tables, with things contained in boxes
                            - And boxes in boxes
            - The reflection of that is so evident in the way that sort of educational system has on people's psyche
                - There has to be that joyous search for meaning that comes from fighting back against this sort of step-by-step approach
                    - Not malevolent in nature, not done from a place of ill-will
                        - It's the ease in which we organize in order to feel a sense of order
                            - Especially in the chaos that we call our lives
                                - Steeped in uncertainty, ever present now that we are in the middle of a global epidemic 
11. a system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information, which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent way with the aim of generating new ideas.[*](((GgF6t07Z4)))

            - Reducing the complexity and chuncking the actionable items creates a fertile environment for new habits to form over time
            - The tool that is used, is nothing compared to the habit of continually sharpening the blade
            - Over time, the habits become behaviors that take less and less decisions to implement providing a true transformation 
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This is the power of [[Roam]], think about it, the frictionless way to input information causes a new change of behavior which predicates a tool that accommodates that the easiest. That’s [[Roam]] in a nutshell!

            - Paying attention to how well we are focused throughout the day will show us signs of where we may be in need of a mindfulness check-up
            - The capturing of ideas throughout the day lessens the mental ram it takes to remember things, especially with knowledge that our minds are essentially forgetting machines
                - [[Reticular Activating Systems]]
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Exponentially multiplied by [[Tony Robbins]]’ RPM method, with a strict adherence to PURPOSE
14. Writing that aims at insight must therefore be organised in a much more open manner[*](((PxFYE_wSD)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Is screenwriting an exercise in insight?
15. Writing is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forth between different tasks[*](((uROSshEwO)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Does this apply to screenwriting? Creative writing that is meant to tell a whole story through connected scenes?
16. So he started to think about how one idea could relate and contribute to different contexts[*](((BjFRHwXXy)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This is exactly why I am interested
17. His slip-box became his dialogue partner, main idea generator and productivity engine. It helped him to structure and develop his thoughts. And it was fun to work with–because it worked.[*](((BjFRHwXXy)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Fun $$X$$ Structure $$X$$ Ideas $$=$$ It Works!!!
18. He constantly generated more ideas than he was able to write down. His texts read as if he is trying to squeeze as much insight and as many ideas as possible into one publication.[*](((jCXXAWuQo)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This is the prolific nature in which I desire to tell stories, adding depth to the breadth
19. Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place[*](((hhTaHBEnz)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Mise en place
20. 3. The third and maybe the most important reason is the very fact that it is simple. Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas. They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means.[*](((j85ILtzRh)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Is it simplicity or is it mastery? When one who is a masterclass in acting performs, it is graceful, like the ballet
21. He then would add references to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of them which were located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts. Some were directly related and read more like comments, others contained not-so-obvious connections. Rarely would a note stay in isolation.[*](((zt7lrN7X2)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Just like when having a conversation with someone you are deeply infatuated with, the sparks with her become altogether magical!
22. By adding these links between notes, Luhmann was able to add the same note to different contexts[*](((k1R5hvOJl)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Then multiply this by the power of tags and pages and block references and sprinkle the 4th dimension of time through having them dated, and you've got something powerful
23. The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points.[*](((gq3S3MuUq)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Tags, pages, and block references in a nutshell
24. We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains[*](((kVuIQFmCg)))
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Again this harkens back to when [[Rich Hickey]] talked about the actual physical limitation of things one can ever juggle. There's an actual numerical amount.

26. "We have the best chance to change our behaviour over the long term if we start with a realistic idea about the difficulties of behavioural change (Dean 2013). And that is not so easy, because the more we are used to doing something in a particular way, the more in control we feel about it, even though we are less in control of it. (This is in part also due to the aforementioned mere-exposure error.)"
    - #[[Literature Notes]] [[Stay dumb, since anything worth doing is going to be difficult]] 
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This reminds of the fundamental concept of having a system that causes the least amount of friction from start to finish. Not necessarily stream-lined for the sake of it, but rather a way so the overwhelming feeling of this process doesn't cause immobility.
