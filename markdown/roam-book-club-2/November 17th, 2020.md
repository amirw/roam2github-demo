- #Chat [[Chinarut]] I poked into our original book club out of curiosity. How are we leveraging what was developed there and bringing these two books/slipboxes together? It‚Äôs absolutely clear to me a tremendous amount of brainthink goes into each of these graphs! I absolutely love [[Lindsey Johnston‚ú®]]‚Äôs insight on how #multiplayer pans out & wondering to what degree we are reusing this:
    - [@roam-book-club/((T8zIAAriq))](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/roam-book-club/page/T8zIAAriq)
        - If [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] was participating in [[Instructions for Book Club]], the way he would like to do it is...
            1. He would want to write his [[Literature Notes]] formatted to his liking and see how others were approaching the book
            2. Then have a second step where he could **contribute to the common good** and look at how we bring ideas together
                - Collecting questions and observations from others that he can freely take [for his own database]
                - Building upon discussions, structures, questions that are deliberately put in the common database
                - That would be where the power of [[Roam]] comes clearly into play in his opinion - when you have to **discuss between what are different perspectives and what can be commonly decided upon**
                    - ^^‚Äùelaborating on the differences and similarities of notes instead of sorting them by topic not only facilitates learning, but facilitates the ability to categorise and create sensible classifications!‚Äù^^ [*](((ljQOefd5j)))
                    - A discussion on why things are interesting in the book, suggestions for connections, pointing out mistakes, blind spots from the author, cross-references to other books, discussions on certain aspects
                        - (as we have been with [[Epistemic spot check]]ing & testing [[Steven B. Johnson]]s claims for errors)
                    - This requires a **mindset shift** from __"what can I take away?"__ to __"what can I contribute?"__
                    - How to have a different objective towards what's interesting to others
- #Question [[Siva Arunagiri]]: How are you all writing down references for your notes on [[Roam]]?
- #Chat[[Mike Kramer]] "Two common misconceptions that this otherwise [insightful article](https://writingcooperative.com/zettelkasten-how-one-german-scholar-was-so-freakishly-productive-997e4e0ca125) endorses and that [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] got right"
    - "Principle of Atomicity"
        - "I have the highest respect for Christian and Sascha of zettelkasten.de and they are credited with formulating this principle of the Zettelkasten method. It is usually said to state that each permanent note consists of a single thought or idea."
            - "The motivation for this principle seems to be that we must tear down texts into their constituent parts, put the interesting parts into our slip box, and then recombine those parts to create our own texts. I agree with this."
            - "Since we are tearing down into constituent parts, we are tearing down into atoms, hence, the Principle of Atomicity."
        - "I believe that it is a mistake to promulgate this principle (and I could paste many, many web pages that reiterate the primacy of this principle) because it overshadows a more primary principle, thereby misdirecting novices from the fundamental ontology of networked thought."
        - "Learning rests on the ability to aggregate simple ideas or actions into increasingly more complex combinations of ideas or actions. This is often called chunking and it refers to the modular nature of our minds."
            - "First, we learn to press one keyboard key with one finger."
            - "Then we learn to combine sequences of keypresses."
            - "Now I am typing this and I am not thinking about each finger separately."
        - {{embed: ((MOX8w9l6I))}}
        - "The contents of our minds are fractal in nature, which means that what looks like an indivisible unit from one perspective (e.g. the individual human being for a demographer) could be an aggregation of many units from a different perspective (a complex consisting of a circulatory system, nervous system, respiratory system, digestive system, etc. for a clinician)."
        - "The concept of an atom is relative to the level of analysis that one is taking."
        - "Hence, the Principle of Atomicity runs at cross-purposes to the primitive chunkability or modularity of the ideas and thoughts expressed in our permanent notes."
        - "If we must formulate a decalogue for the Zettelkasten, we might consider starting with Thou Shalt Write Chunkabe Notes."
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] How I chunk ideas, concepts, thoughts, and words, makes me either want to keep doing what I'm doing... or throw my hands-up in frustration.
            - "The learned commentators will explicate this as follows:"
                - "Any note should be combinable or connectable with another note."
            - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] I love this commandment!

and then of course we most also recognize that one person's chunkable is another person's unchunked or underchunked or overchunked or whatever

so in the end it becomes a deeply personal process of distillation
                - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]]Yes! [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] emphasizes this in the book, and I think it is essential. You and I will read the same book and we will create very different Zettels, not because one of us is better at Zetteling but because we have highly individualized interests and, hence, are creating our Zettels for different reasons.
        - "More simply, we should replace the Principle of Atomicity with the Principle of Chunkability."
        - 
    - "Principle of Inclusivity"
        - "That's my label for the essay's injunction:"
            - " "Add notes without fear. You can never have too much information in your Zettelkasten.""
        - {{embed: ((mLFDl3Dvg))}}
        - "Just as the Principle of Atomicity, was not baseless, neither is this Principle of Inclusivity."
        - "We should create permanent notes when we get a hunch that we think might, after some incubation, turn someday into a good idea."
        - "But [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] and even the zettelkasten.de guys (with their formulation of the "collector's fallacy") ably put the lie to the idea that we should capture everything:"
            - "A friend of mine does not let any idea, interesting finding or quote he stumbles upon dwindle away and writes everything down. He always carries a notebook with him and often makes a few quick notes during a conversation. The advantage is obvious: No idea ever gets lost. The disadvantages are serious, though: As he treats every note as if it belongs to the ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù category, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. . . . It is not surprising that my friend has a bookshelf filled with notebooks full of wonderful ideas, but not a single publication to show. [*](((7GWVsCHA5)))"
        - "Instead of shoveling everything into our slip box, we should, again, follow the advice of [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] (70) and be more discriminating:"
            - "The slip-box forces us to be selective in reading and note-taking, but the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections.[*](((2J1X0Ixx_)))"
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] What about the gap for people who are seeking that discussion, but lost in the abyss of "is this right?"
                - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] I really like this idea of focusing on a simple criterion, and that criterion being "does this add to the discussion?" 

It reminds me a little of [[Christopher Alexander]] and his ideas about allowing emergent structure to ''unfold", in that there's a felt sense for me that a well written permanent note "adds liveliness" - it has a sense of possibility, of aesthetic "fit", that just "feels" right - and keeping this in mind I think is a helpful counterbalance to the tendency to try to make the whole system excessively ordered or "logical".
                    - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]]I was about to write that I don't know who this guy is, and then I Googled him and realized I read his article in the prior club about A City is not a Tree. 
I think that what you are saying here is very important. My big fear is that as my Zettelkasten grows it will become too unwieldy. I query for two or three tags with an "and" and still get 10,000 hits. The problem, as I currently see it, is to get the right balance between structure and chaos, as [[Steven Johnson]] might have said. So, I think I have to follow your advice from the get-go and create groupings of notes based on the "felt sense."
        - "More simply, we should replace the Principle of Inclusivity with the Principle of Selectivity."
- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"How are you enjoying [[Roam Book Club]]? Describe your experience. #feedback"
    1. [[Yingyue Liu]]I hope there will be another round. I missed the former 3 sessions but I like that there is enough information recorded here for me to catch up with the book club a little bit. But I still want to join the live sessions in the future.
Besides, anybody thought of hosting the book club in other languages. I read through the book [[How to Take Smart Notes]] and wrote 5000-word notes in Chinese. It seems easier to assimilate the ideas in my mother tongue. A [[Meetup]] in Chinese would be a great alternative, too.
        - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] - [[@[[Yingyue Liu]]]] would you have any interest in "hosting" a Chinese-language "book club"? or co-hosting - probably ideal to have a small "crew" of people
        - #Reply-from[[Yingyue Liu]]-[[@[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]]Hey Matt. I think co-hosting a Chinese-language 'book club' is a great idea. 
        - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] this sounds really great [[@[[Yingyue Liu]]]]! [[@[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]] perhaps nudge Jessy next you speak to her. I will do the same.
