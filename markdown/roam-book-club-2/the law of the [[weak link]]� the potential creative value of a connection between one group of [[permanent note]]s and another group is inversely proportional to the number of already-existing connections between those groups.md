- notes::
    - the words "potential" here carries a huge burden since the overwhelming proportion of links will be a waste of time and mental inergy.
    - a group of [[permanent note]]s is a context. Exaptation  takes a single trait that was in one group and adds it to another group
        - [[an idea that was originally useful in one context, and which is later used in a different context, has been exapted]]
