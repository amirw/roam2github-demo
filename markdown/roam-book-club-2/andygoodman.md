            - [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] The Author
                - Experiment
                - It was a procrastination project
                - Like systems theory
                - Nickolas Leumens?
                - Leverage for higher education
                - Interdisciplinary way to connect ideas
                - [[Question]] Benefits of reading and taking notes in this style? In a rigorous way
                    - Making connections between ideas that are new and old an those that are already forgotten. Avoid floating on new ideas.
                    - 2 notes at different stages: I thought this was the same idea but isn't. 
                        - Addition, contradiction, something else: how to justify
                        - Lumens : note as a dialogue partner; doesnt think for itself but so much better at storing as it was at that time.
                        - Writing takes more time however; sometimes it's better to read more.
                - [[Question]] Cross domain applicability outside of academia
                    - For professional writers intially
                    - Now more broadly; business background, coders
                - [[Question]] handwritten vs typed?
                    - Different: written does have benefits. Screen is a source for distraction.
                    - Risk: start thinking about the software rather than the content.
                    - Ne benefit is with software.
                - [[Question]] routine: writing / note-taking balance?
                    - warning: looking for a perfect system... daily routine XX projects?
                    - Don't highlight things you want to take notes on later.
                    - Sometimes full emersion is better; sometimes, projects have to be more ad-hoc
                    - Routines for when you are stuck.
                    - Being flexible more important than being rigid.
                - [[Question]] [[multiplayer Zetteling]] [[Individual and Collective Zetteling]] How will it work? How? Advice?
                    - Might be more important to put it into practice: might be better to focus on the task;
                    - Focus on the meaning of the book?
                    - Take Zettlekasten notes as described... not alway best to write into practice.
                        - 1. Individually?
                        - 2. collectively?
                    - Principles and idea of Zettlecasten is the focus of the book.
                    - Large notes: granularity on the block level?
                    - Collective writing allows you to do different things to that you can do on your own. Where will this go?
                        - Note sequences and density: now, within one note to lend coherence, if density then connected
                        - One information in each block; different types of links between blocks... ie. one  word = index entry. These are notes within network that are a place to jump to and from; rather than links to descriptive titles = entry points or clusters. 
                        - You need a firewall as you get familiar with your own Zettelkasten and that canâ€™t happen in a collective process; but what kind of experiences do you have when there is so much possible, when you do something collectively that is impossible when you do it on your own.
                        - These clusters are different to the index point

                    - We linearise learning and research.
                    - The [[Zettelkasten]] method is bottom-up and emergent. As such it provides a tool that affords learning, research and insight that other methods do not

                - There is a "way" - but it is not the true way, since that wouldn't be written in words: meditate ;-) - to use this collectively. 
                - I'm not sure if I am putting my notes in so that they create the type of feedback that supports the emergence of a collective understanding, if that is a desirable outcome.
                - Feeling: there will be 'attractors' (in the chaos sense), and I think that might be an overarching objective; and that those 'attractors' will accelerate one's own understanding, and more importantanly - I believe - a shared understanding with others.
