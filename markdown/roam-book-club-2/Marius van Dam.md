- Literature Notes::
    - [[Introduction]]
        - Essentially explains how this book focusses on a totally different aspect of writing compared to other books on writing. 
            - It doesn't focus on
                - Writing good prose or the formal requirements for "good writing".
                - The psychology associated with the process of writing. As creating a good proces and environment has more influence on results.
                - Actually is doesn't focus on the process of writing the final piece you are setting out to publish.
            - Instead it is about note-taking as a systematical approach for gathering information that eventually can be used to productively create the actual pieces of writing.
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - If this is not a motivation to try to adopt an approach like is going to be discussed in this book i don't know what is!
            - "Until now, writing and note-taking techniques were usually taught without much regard to the overarching workflow. This book aims to change that. It will present you with the tools of note-taking that turned the son of a brewer into one of the most productive and revered social scientists of the 20th century. But moreover, it describes how he implemented them into his workflow so he could honestly say: “I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.” A good structure allows you to do that, to move seamlessly from one task to another–without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture."
        - "A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). Something like that does not happen by chance"
        - The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery–or insight.
        - "This book is for you, the good students, ambitious academics and curious nonfiction writers who understand that insight doesn’t come easy and that writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing"
            - Because as explained in the previous paragraphs the good student understands that it takes more time, there are more good questions to be asked and most easily found questions have been answered before by other people. They are less over-confident
