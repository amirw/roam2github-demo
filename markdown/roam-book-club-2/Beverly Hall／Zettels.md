    - #[[Zettels]]  A desired flow state, one where ideas, insights and connections come naturally, is an energetic, light process.   
        - #[[Reference Notes]]  [Chapter 8, Paragraph 1](((RK0T2uHBh)))
        - #[[Literature Notes]]  Flow is a momentum in and of itself and is energizing
            - A good workflow fuels itself, and pulls the participant along with its own momentum.  A good workflow is not forced.  It is a light process, comparatively speaking.  This is an ultimate, desired goal.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] My workflow goal is an undistracted, consistent, focused, energetic state of flow to produce connections and results
            - Workflow
                - It means desired process
                - To get from A to Z
                    - A being the starting point
                    - Z being the ending point
                        - Not necessarily a linear process
                            - It develops organically for me
                                - Rather than A, B, C, D
                                    - It's a lot like a tapestry
                                        - Like a painting
                                            - Ultimately it all comes together
            - Ease of process
                - Lack of distraction
                    - Sitting my butt in the chair and just getting it done
                - Interest
                    - It's something that's engaging
                    - Fulfilling
            - Flow state
                - For me, what maybe the classic
                    - Lose track of time
                    - Fully immersed at the task at hand
                        - Sitting in front of the computer and making the work happen
            - Getting to that desired flowstate
                - That's something that seems to me that is the state where the connections are more easily made
                - Insights are coming and the questions are the right questions
                    - Being generated
                    - Sometimes it comes all at once like a Whoosh~
            - Having energy vs. being drained of energy
                - I view that as not being hard
                    - I'm not talking about not working hard
                    - It's not being difficult in presenting obstacles
                        - Lighter, elevated, process

    - Sometimes you need to fuel the process and sometimes the process fuels itself
    - Flow is a momentum in and of itself and is energizing
        - This is the ultimate goal.

- #[[Fleeting Notes]]  Reading drives learning drives discernment drives understanding and becomes a self-perpetuating, leveling up process
    - What does it mean to express understanding? | How is understanding expressed?
        - Before expressing understanding, I must first understand
        - This means first seeking to understand
            - Really dig into it
            - Avoid relying on assumptions
                - But clearly note the assumptions if they must be considered
                    - And note the impact of the assumptions
            - Get deep below the surface
                - Discard superficial thoughts
            - Reveal questions
                - What's missing
                - What's not known
                - What's inconsistent or inaccurate
                    - Identify clarifying questions
        - Discern what's relevant
            - The true essence of the message
                - Not just underlines
                - Not restatements 
            - Discard (or set aside for further thought) what’s not relevant for the context
        - Then explain in plain terms, like to a 12 year old
            - Make it my own
                - In terms of what's meaningful to me 
                - Based on my experiences
                - Based on where I need to go 
    - This process blows learning wide open
        - Infinite possibilities
        - Search for learning experiences
    - Reading process is also infinitely changed
        - What I notice now is different
        - Discernment of reading material (books and articles) is important
    - The process is:  read=> discern => dig to understand => learn => apply => read some more
        - Keep going, go faster
            - The more we read, the more we learn, and the better we get at learning
                - Learning is a deep purpose
                - Reading drives learning
            - Consistent, intentional engagement of the process 
            - It's like a flywheel, maybe slow to start but once it starts it travels easily under it's own momentum and energy
    - It's a constant, self-perpetuating, leveling up process
        - Leveling up personally 
            - Encourages leveling up for other participants  
        - Not only for the zettelkasten process, but in all other areas.  
            - This is a massively important goal
                - It is a goal to aspire to

    - The ability to express understanding in one’s own words is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes–and only by doing it with the chance of realizing our lack of understanding can we become better at it. But the better we become, the easier and quicker we can make notes, which again increases the number of learning experiences. The same applies to the crucial ability to distinguish the important bits of a text from the less important ones: the better we become at it, the more effective our reading will become, the more we can read, the more we will learn. We will enter a beautiful, virtuous circle of competency. You cannot help but feel motivated by it.
