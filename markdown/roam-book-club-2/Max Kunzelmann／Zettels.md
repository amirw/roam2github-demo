                - #[[Literature Notes]] Energy of interesting projects can be used to work on projects which are boring or need to be done and building a habit lowers the initial amount of energy required to get into the flow which will produce momentum and energy.
                    - Exergonic reaction: I need to put energy into this process to keep it going. Like using energy from a different project or different area to work on something which I don't like.
                    - Endergonic reaction: When this reaction is triggered with some initial amount of energy (habit?), this reaction continues to happen for some time and releases energy which can be used for the same or other projects. Getting into the flow releases energy and keeps me working on some projects. 
                    - Building a habit can remove or lower the initial amount of energy required to start a process. As soon as this happened, the work itself can create momentum (and energy) to keep us working on a project.
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] I can use the momentum and flow of intersting things to work on boring stuff which needs to be done. The way this can be done is to trick myself to like some boring task and working on it for a limited time before working on some interesting task. Building a habit might be very useful.

                    - Get myself to like German
                        - That changed something
                            - I need to do this
                                - I'm going to analyse this poem

                                    - A very good point
                    - Building momentum
                        - If I'm in sort of a flow - like programming
                            - That builds momentum
                                - I don't want to stop until I finish
                        - Couple of times I started at 8pm, sitting there at 1am
                            - Very, very useful

                                            - 2-3-4 hours focusing on the problem
                                                - Very productive
                                                - Also important to let the mind wander
                                                - Going for a walk
                        - Excited about one project
                        - Work on what I have to do first, for an hour
                            - Then go back to what I want to do
                    - Reading the book Flow
                        - That's what I wanted to do for quite some time
                            - Because I heard of the word flow a year ago

                                        - I haven't read it yet is because there are other things that I want to do first
                                        - I understand from the diagrams
                                            - I can't know that for sure until l read the book first

                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] By indenting blocks related information can be kept together and correctly referenced in Roam. And it's possible to branch into multiple discussions or arguments from one key aspect.
                    - indenting keeps __related information together__ and these block can be referenced in a nice way with roam.
                    - with indenting we can __branch__ from a thought into a discussion and built multiple parallel discussions doing so.
                    - top bullet is key idea. Further indented notes support that point with other arguments (eg. used for a research paper but also applies in general).
                    - deeply related to previous thought ($$\rightarrow$$ new indented block)
                    - **parent-child** relationship.
                        - The indented block is deeply connected to the previous block
                    - **sibling relationship**. at the same level
                        - same, like major points, major concepts. Keep in mind that references do not recognize these siblings because they are not indented.
                    - make sure to think about how a information relates to the previous block of information.
                        - deeply connected -> indented
                        - on the same level of thought -> sibling
