    - **Metadata:**
        - **Title:** [[How to Take Smart Notes: One Simple Technique to Boost Writing, Learning and Thinking - for Students, Academics and Nonfiction Book Writers]]
            - **Tags:** #Books #Ongoing | [[November 5th, 2020]] to _______
        - Authored by:: [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]]
        - **Year:** 2017
    - **Context**
        - Why Did I Consume This?:: I felt frustrated in the books and information that I consumed in the past. I had no system in synthesizing those information. Came across on  this book in my effort to effectively learn and not waste my precious time on not doing anything and forgetting what I've learned.
        - Who Recommended This?:: [[Shu Omi]]
    - ^^**Questions for SÃ¶nke:**^^
        - 
    - [[Goals for Book Club]]
        - Learn more about Roam Research.
        - Finally create my effective note-taking system. Read the book already but lack in execution because of inadequate guide. I hope I can learn and decide my final personal knowledge management for now but becoming open for improvement and growth as time goes by.
        - Finally not hesitate and not be overwhelmed with the process and effectively synthesize everything I learned through writing.
    - **Fleeting Notes**
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] #Chat    #@[[Joel Chan]] #@[[Sue Borchardt]] Having these same frustration now that I started. 
            - "Feeling constricted thinking in this space (can't connect to my own graph, transfer insights over easily), not too different from what [[Sue Borchardt]] mentions:"
            - "I read [[How to Take Smart Notes]] about the same time I started using roam (January 2020?) and took a ton of notes in my own graph. I think what I'm more interested in for these four weeks is experimenting with what it's like to try to work in a shared graph with others. I've tried this a bit with [[Joel Chan]] and it's been kinda painful. This is partly because I'm jumping into the deep end of his existing graph and he as established conventions quite different from mine (which are fairly non-existent -- i'm pretty ad-hoc). It's also been frustrating in that I can't migrate my insights back to my own graph. "
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] I had the same issue initially and realized it was more useful to stay on my page & focus on getting through the book. Since you've already read the book, do you have a set of permanent notes and a slipbox in your personal graph? have you been adding to your slipbox on a regular basis based on what you are reading?

            - #[[Fleeting Notes]]  __"Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note."__
**Thinking of anything that exempts on this and found none.**
                - "Everybody writes. Especially in academia. Students write and professors write. And nonfiction writers, who are the third group of people this book is aiming to help, obviously write as well. And writing doesnâ€™t necessarily mean papers, articles or books, but everyday, basic writing. We write when we need to remember something, be it an idea, a quote or the outcome of a study. We write when we want to organise our thoughts and when we want to exchange ideas with others. Students write when they take an exam, but the first thing they do to prepare even for an oral examination is to grab pen and paper. We write down not only those things we fear we wonâ€™t remember otherwise, but also the very things we try to memorise. Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note."

    - ## **NUGGETS FROM THIS COMMUNITY**
        - The whole process is what makes any endeavor worthwhile. #[[Permanent Notes]]
            - "Ancient Greek Heraclitus said, all things are best understood as processes. "
                - "A river is not an object, it is water in motion. The sun is not a object, it's a burning fire half way finished. "
        - Enjoying everything as a process is better than expecting too much growth from it in your first try. #[[Permanent Notes]]
            - "Enjoy it as a process rather than lament what it isn't yet "
        - I also envision of a product than promotes mindset shift. #[[Permanent Notes]] #[[Inspired by Roam Research]]
            - "For many of us, Roam is a mindset shift more than a software product."
        - #Chat[[Antonette Laderas]] 

"The default mode of book club is to ask you to embrace a mindset of doing stuff rather than asking for permission. " 

"Create tags, use attributes, for the most part, do whatever you want.  No wrong answers. No fear of retribution. Death to insider knowledge. Death to achievement as compliance. There are no mistakes. "

I am hoping this can also be possible in the formal education system.
