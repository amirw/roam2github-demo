-  Hi Everyone. I'm psyched to be part of the Roam Book Club. Also, I recently joined [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dthTMW) solely to connect with and learn from my fellow Roamans and take part in the great vibes of [RoamCult](https://twitter.com/CultRoam).
- I thought you'd all enjoy - [Most Influential Essays](https://www.notion.so/b64d5144c7cc4c7a991119eff4588428?v=4c2dba4120a644768db4a0d42839f491). This past summer Patrick O'Shaughnessy of [Investor Field Guide](https://investorfieldguide.com/) [asked the twitterverse](https://twitter.com/patrick_oshag/status/1278307221944840193) for the most influential essays they had ever read. He then aggregated the responses and their respective links into a single resource.
