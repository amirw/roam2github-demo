        - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] The literature note has a one-to-one relationship with the material. A permanent note has a one-to-many relationship and expands beyond the boundaries of the material. Both of them form the strongest relationships of their type. "
        - 
    2. [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] 
        - I might be starting a controversy here with this, but I'm not sure I really believe in the concept of `permanent note`, at all. 

**I lean towards** [[Herodotus]] **in that I believe you never step into the same river twice, and also, the meaning of a note is never the same, not even the next time you read it. ** 
            - That is, I am not really aiming for carved-in-stone insights at all, (although I DO believe that maybe some notes have more power to be persistently useful than others) ... my hunch is that it is only the test of time that teaches me which notes those might be. 
                - In that sense, I might prefer a language that marks this kind of note as a "persistently useful hypothesis", not a commandment carved in stone Moses-comes-down-from-the-mountain style.
            - But to circle back to the original question, I agree with what [[Wade Dominic]] wrote above, it's useful to understand that these "persistently useful hypothesis notes" form links that connect them to the world outside the text, the world of other books I have read, concepts, experience, etc etc
                - This for me relates to a feeling I had when I was exploring Andy Matuschak's digital garden - the fact is, I don't agree with some of his "permanent notes". And when I realized that I didn't agree with them, it led me to question the integrity of other parts of his structure, too. 

                    - (Don't get me wrong, Andy is brilliant - and his experiments are fascinating and provocative. Much respect to him, absolutely. But the idea of putting __any__ note on a pedestal, to me, creates the risk of amplifying one's own blind spots by creating structural problems, that permeate all of the neighbors in a networked set of thoughts.) ... I want to resist the pull to create "sacred cow" notes.
                        - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] What if the permanent part of the note wasn't the words that are consecrated as such, but rather the process in which those words are disputed, dismantled, and integrated over time?
                            - The permanent part is the process of how the insight came to be, through thoroughly dissecting the beginning note, and then watching the branches refine that first parent block
                        - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] [[@[[Beau Haan]]]] I like what you are getting at here, I can see a different definition of "permanence" that pertains not to their truth value per se (i.e. we are not mining "nuggets of everlasting wisdom") but rather a kind of "permanent status" within the river of our thought
                            - I think that although I "get" the distinction that Soenke is making between "fleeting" and "literature" and "permanent", I think I might slice these with different semantics
                            - I kind of feel like (for me at least) "fleeting" is more like an observation of one's own reaction to what one is reading or learning, 
                            - "literature" is the recap - in one's own words - of someone else's thoughts;
                            - and then "permanent" (a term that might be indistinguishable from the way we were referring to some notes as "zettels", back in book club v 1.0) - that is just an attempt to put an original thought, solidly and completely, into our own words.
                            - i.e. more than a "response" and more than a "paraphrase", this is the finding of our own authorial "voice"
                            - Once the note is fully "owned" (i.e. these permanent notes which feel authorially MINE) ... then, in a sense, it has a "permanent" place in my slip-box or note collection, even if its long term role with that slip-box is only ever defined by its interaction with everything else I write there ...
        - 
    3. [[Beau Haan 📌]]"A literature note is the integration of what someone else has thoroughly thought through and a permanent note is the integration of what I have thoroughly thought through"
{{[[POMO]]: 10}}
        - Great question, but a better question to start with to disassociate these two semantic phrases would be:
            - What relationship does a `literature note` have with a `permanent note`?
            - Let's see... first off what the hell is a literature note? I want to define literature:
                - ^^late Middle English (in the sense ‘knowledge of books’): via French from Latin __litteratura__, from __littera __(see [letter](x-dictionary:r:m_en_gbus0576900:com.apple.dictionary.NOAD:letter)).^^
                - Notes from the knowledge of books, hmm..
                - That's interesting because it's almost like when an author spends the time and focus to create a work of literature, they are imparting their decisions of the syntax and sequence of words in order to relay to the reader a certain or uncertain message, right?
                    - I'm posing lots of questions, because there's got to be something stimulating for me to want to dive in deeper. All of the characters that make up a word, slip through my mind, until I can establish a clear relationship to __"what I already know"__ with __"what I don't know, yet"__
            - Let's take a look at the latter phrase... permanent seems so... permanent:
                - ^^late Middle English: from Latin __permanent- __‘remaining to the end’ (perhaps via Old French), from __per- __‘through’ + __manere __‘remain’.^^
                - Interesting... the definition that resides in my mind when I think of something permanent is more akin to a __"permanent"__ marker splayed on the side of a child's bedroom wall
                    - Something destroying the blank canvas
                    - Something disrupting the beauty of cleanliness 
                    - Something that is difficult to remove, and really just a pain in the ass
                - So how can I associate this phrase to what I already know, and the idea that comes to mind, is like a deep memory of a loved one that has passed. 
                - The permanent impact that she had on me is absolutely real, and still quite indelible, but her presence is no longer here in the physical form
                    - That's what I think of when I think of something that ^^'remains to the end'^^
            - But what about the book, what about the book's definition?
                1. "Literature notes are notes but they exist outside the "latticework" of the slip-box. When we review literature notes and create permanent notes, we are weaving them in, creating links and associations. Even if the literature notes are archived, we have integrated the new information."
                2. "He usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes in the slip-box. And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his material. More often than not, a new note would directly follow up on another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes. He then would add references to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of them which were located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts. Some were directly related and read more like comments, others contained not-so-obvious connections. Rarely would a note stay in isolation."
                3. "Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. Throw away the fleeting notes from step one and put the literature notes from step two into your reference system. You can forget about them now. All that matters is going into the slip-box."
            - I think there's power in what he's saying, but I also know that lots can change in a couple of years, and a lot changes in the field of technology, so being beholden to a definition that is concrete is something difficult to just let be~
            - I'm rambling... let's re-focus... new song~ ♫ 
        - But aha! what if that's it... a permanent note is something that's supposed to be used as a starting point to argue against. It's held up by literature notes, that have references pointing to a specific moment in time, by a specific person, written with a specific idea in mind.
            - And if the literature notes can capture that essentially, then when the permanent note is put to test, than the dialogue that occurs is exactly what I feel like is the most powerful idea of all of this
                - Let me say that again, let me re-iterate...
                    - The difference between the literature note and permanent note is that one is meant to reference a point in time, space, and context, and the latter is meant to be buttressed as what is to be argued over time through the dialogue within the [[Zettelkasten]]
                        - Let me say that again, but explaining it to a 5-year old:
                            - The difference between a literature note and a permanent note...
                            - Explain it to a friggin' 5 year old... they don't know what a literature/permanent note means...!!!
                                - Okay, so there's two types of notes:
                                    - ~~One meant to play in (permanent)~~
                                    - ~~One meant to show you where the playgrounds are located (literature)~~
                                    - Let's do it again, but with more clarity
                                        - Literature notes is the play that happened last summer under the streetlamp after the sun has set, giving time and place
                                        - Permanent notes is remembering that moment and rehashing that memory, adding, displacing, attempting to remember each detail
        - ~~The difference between a literature note and a permanent note is that one references a specific point in time, while a permanent note is the dialogue about that moment~~ 
15:38 - I don't think this is as accurate as I'd like...
            - {{[[POMO]]: 15}}
                - I want to take another stab at this...
                - What the hell is a literature note? That's the notes that I've taken that relate directly to the lecture, book, podcast, etc... it's the actual notes of what someone else has articulated and made into a sequence called sentences
                    - So the biggest delineation when I think of `Fleeting` and `Literature` is just that...
                        - The `Fleeting` notes are essential what is divinely sparked from the the litany of ideas and concepts that float in my own brain.
                        - Then the next step is the `Literature` which I think is a misnomer, especially with the amount of technological advancements since [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s time, but I digress
                            - The `Literature` notes, which if broken down to it's most fundamental aspects, would be the notes, still written in my own words, on the "text" written, spoken, or seen.
                            - This provides me with the actual notes on what's being said, adding upon the reactive notes that the `Fleeting` notes have attempted to capture
                            - Ideally, I'd want it structured something akin to this and always written in the [[Daily Notes]] page:
                                - 15:46 (The timestamp allows for GPS)
                                    - #[[Literature Notes]] Summary here
                                        - Source:: [Book, YouTube, www, etc.](LinkPastedHere)
                                            - All of my literature notes are listed here, which are essentially detailed summarizations of the source material
                                            - Not so much what resonates with me, but rather, notes in my own words of the actual source material
                                        - Process:: Summary of my `Fleeting Notes`
                                            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] All of my fleeting notes are listed here, free-form, without judgement of how it relates to the actual source material, but rather a way for me to just circumambulate around WHY this resonated with me
                            - The reason I prefer this way of structuring is that the power of [[Roam]] gives us this unique ability to have everything be referenced at the BLOCK level...
                                - Again, one more reason why I believe that the structure that [[Shu Omi]], and others speak of, are missing the thing that [[Roam]] does so damn well...
                                    - It opens up the possibility of something far deeper than the traditional folders system do, but I digress
                            - You'll notice the Source and Process attributes are siblings, yet the `#Literature Notes` tag is at the parent block level, this is to be able to maximize visibility when in-line "Click for references"
                                - The summary after each attribute also gives a quick way to see what's underneath as branches, but leaves the system aesthetically pleasing
                                    - Which I believe to be of the utmost importance, since messiness is okay, but disgust at what we see, is most certainly not~
                - Then how exactly does the `Permanent` notes look? Well... I'd rather not move too quickly ahead, when even me proposing [this](((QDFIR3ycA))) structure is a thorn to my side...  
                - And to finally answer the damn question...
                    - The literature note:
                        1. Written in my own words
                        2. Reading, listening, watching, what the source material is saying and interpreting it through my framework of conscsiousness
                        3. Directly related to the source, giving me the essence of what the author has spent their due diligence in forming into the proper syntax of words, creating sentences of meaning, for the reader/viewer/participant to interpret
                    - The permanent note:
                        1. Written in my own words
                        2. A way to continue the dialogue between what I've already thought and this new supporting, disputing, catalyzing thought (supported by Fleeting, Literature, and Reference notes)
                        3. Finding a place in the [[Folgezettel]] to properly place this new idea
                            - Folgezettel = nested, sequence of notes
                        4. The immutable, woah~ [[Rich Hickey]]... the immutable branches that tell the story of how I was able to support, dispute, and integrate the top-most parent block
                - In summary, I think the difference between a literature note and a permanent note is...
                    - A literature note is the integration of what someone else has thoroughly thought through and a permanent note is the integration of what I have thoroughly thought through
    4. [[Brandon Toner]] 
        - I'm just gonna put [[Wade Dominic]]'s answer here because it's wonderful and specific.
            -  "#[[Fleeting Notes]] The literature note has a one-to-one relationship with the material. A permanent note has a one-to-many relationship and expands beyond the boundaries of the material. Both of them form the strongest relationships of their type. " #[[BT flag]]
        - Elaborated on, I think a literature note is directly related to the **literature it is derived from**, while a [permanent note]([[permanent notes]]) is more widely useable. A [permanent note]([[permanent notes]]) doesn't have any dependency on the source material. It is an assertion in its own right. It should have supporting references from various places, ideally. 
            - In this sense, a literature note can ALSO BE a permanent note. There are overlaps in their [[Venn Diagram]]s.
        - Truthfully, the map between [[fleeting notes]], [[literature notes]], [[permanent notes]], [[branching notes]] is hard for me to wrap my head around. I'm getting close. But specific definitions are important, I think, so that I'm not scratching my head, saying **"what type of note is this?!"**
            - And then there are [[intermediary notes]]... 
                - Which I have no clue how to use, I think [[Beau Haan 📌]] explains them well here:
                    - [[intermediary notes]] are building blocks. They are the constant sounds of new ideas into the [[zettelkasten]]. They are also notes that haven't been well placed, yet. [*](((SrXaIzvN6)))
                        - He adds:
                            - There should be a clear separation between your [[intermediary notes]] and your [[zettelkasten]]'s block references. To "prevent the dialogue you have created from becoming dissonant". [*](((mWuFnpNR4)))
                                - #Chat [[Brandon Toner]] [[@[[Beau Haan 📌]]]]... can you elaborate on this? I'm not sure I understand the role of intermediary notes in your interpretation. Are they the similar to [[fleeting notes]] for you? 

fleeting = related to specific content?
intermediary = related to your own insights and musings?
                                    - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] All of this is simply my opinion... LOL! 
                                        - For me, and my experience with [[Zettelkasten]] inside of [[Roam]]--and I have to say that from the outset, since the technology that this tool is built upon is instrumental in how I've conceptualized this practical system:
                                            1. "[[The fleeting note is the highest order of connectedness, captured, or else lost to the abyss]]"
                                            2. "A literature note is the integration of what someone else has thoroughly thought through and a permanent note is the integration of what I have thoroughly thought through"
                                            3. Branching Notes = Relevant Notes
                                                - But utilized inside of [[Roam]] is what made [[Sönke Ahrens]] intrigued about what I've come up with
                                            4. Intermediary Notes = Project Notes
                                                - As for intermediary notes, I don't often use them, but I keep that placeholder for those times when the building block of an idea hasn't been fully fleshed out.
                                                    - If I keep them "firewalled" from the conversation that I have with my [[Zettelkasten]] then it doesn't cause that sense of discord that often happens at a house-party, with drunkards that have taken one too many shots
                                                    - I think the whole idea behind all of this, is to solve the problems as they arise, and there was a point where I needed to utilize intermediary notes, but more often than not... it's straight from Fleeting→ Permanent
                                                        - Which I prefer, since the process is so fun--adding new ideas to what I've already thought
                                        - And again, it comes back down to simplicity amidst the complexity 
                                            - The fundamentals of how [[Roam]] works in order to create an idiosyncratic system that provides the framework for habitual practice
                                                - It's annoying, when we just want the answers, but in my experience, that's probably why this shit hasn't worked, or rather why none of the other ways haven't worked~
    5. [[Joel Chan]]
        - Woah, really fun discussion!
        - I'm sympathetic to [[Matt Brockwell]]'s discomfort with the connotations of the term "permanent". I prefer the idea of **persistence**. In part because in my own work, ideas are never finished. Never! Otherwise, it's not research! So, I resonate with the idea of a "[persistently useful hypothesis](((YXlo1LggT)))"
        - Personally, in practice, when I thought about permanent notes, I felt reluctant to change them over time, whereas I am not reluctant to change and modify and edit my "zettels".
        - I also think the permanent notes term might be related to the idea of having a permanent, fixed, ID that can be used to link to other ideas. Maybe a necessary feature for the analog manifestation of a zettelkasten.
        - I also think the recurring themes here about the relationship to sources being part of the core distinction between literature notes (one-to-one with a source, as [[Wade Dominic]] concisely [notes](((vn0fms9Kw)))) and "permanent notes" (akin to synoptic reading, a generalizable claim that may be supported/refuted by multiple literature notes/sources).
        - I've been developing my own model with slightly different terms:
            - Literature notes are "micropubs", which are highly contextualized, past tense, author-bound and time-bound **observations** from sources (author A did X under conditions Y and observed Z; with block references to snippets that flesh out A/X/Y/Z)
            - "Permanent notes" are higher-level "evergreen/zettel" **claims/hypotheses** (e.g., evergreen notes). 
            - I find this distinction to be powerful way to achieve a disciplined imagination for [[synthesis]], to balance the tension between theory and data, and between abstraction/compression and context.
                - Relevant quotes from [[gruberDarwinManPsychological1974]] (one of my favorite books right now on creative [[synthesis]])
                    - #quotes
                        - The construction of the theory and the marshaling of the evidence entailed somewhat different activities on Darwin's part.
                        - Theory construction is a matter of rumination and schematization; it is primarily an internal effort, involving play with ideas---information and generalizations---already incorporated in existing schemes of thought; its end product is the alteration of those schemes.
                        - The marshaling of evidence and the construction of general laws from particular facts is largely a matter of observation and data collection, the noting of similarities among events, and the drawing of general conclusions. But this marshaling of evidence is not simply "induction" if that term means a theoretically neutral activity or an activity preceding the construction of a theory. The whole point is that information can __only__ be incorporated in existing schemes of thought. When we notice the similarity between events or processes that seem superficially different, we are guided by a point of view that makes some characteristics important, certain comparisons possible and meaningful. This is what Hanson meant when he wrote, "Observation is a theory-laden undertaking."
                        - The two kinds of task, theoretical and evidential, entail different activities, and in the long run they may yield distinguishable products for our consideration. But __in vivo__, in the life of the thinking person, they are thoroughly intertwined. The most speculative "castle in the air" is triggered by a simple observation or a friend's remark about his dog. Hard work amassing the facts on a special point is guided by a long theoretical argument with which it may have only a tenuous logical relationship: the theory does not absolutely depend on the facts, nor could the facts ever guarantee the theory. The relation of theory and evidence is not simply logical but psychological.

            - It's possible that my model is specific to the kind of synthesis I do for my academic research, and how zettelkasten fits into that.
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] I love that you emphasized the personalization of how you've implemented [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam]]
                    - Mine is completely different in form and function, yet the core concepts are still in place~
                        1. Personalized
                        2. Dialogue-partner
                        3. Idea-generating machine
                        4. Habitualized
        - The fleeting note is a bit more nebulous for me. For me, fleeting notes are the "[chaos stream](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/roamfm/joel-chan-knowledge-0CcxF23g1OS/)" or "magic junkyard". They're like the sparks and hunches that could coalesce into a **literature note **(a cogent distillation of a contextualized claim from a source) or a **zettel/persistent/evergreen note** (a cogent distillation of a generalizable idea that I might use as a building block for synthesis)

    - [[Henry Finkelstein]] #in-reply-to [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] I like some of the concepts noted here, though I got a little tripped up on the idea of literature notes not being actually connected to the literature. I'm curious to hear how others are bundling their concepts into more dedicated pages
    - #Reply [[Brandon Toner]]: [[@[[Henry Finkelstein]]]]

How would you define / use [[literature notes]] alternatively?[*](((TZ4K1yYrS)))

- #Question [[Beau Haan 📌]] How does `#Question` parse differently from, say, `#Directory`?
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] Do I understand the question to be that are you asking **why it looks different?** 
It's 100% cosmetic - there's no functional difference at all - 
and the change-of-appearance is achieved with snippets of CSS code, that are stored on this page: [[roam/css]]
- #Question [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] How do things like {{[[TODO]]}} and {{[[slider]]}} work?
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] what you see is what you get - they are largely cosmetic dashboard features with special functionalities added; the slider lets lots of people vote on a poll, the TODO checkbox is a hashtag that morphs to `# DONE` when you check the little box. That's pretty much all there is to it.
- #Question [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] Can I hide my email address?
    - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] I had the same question.
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] ... not that I know of. (?)
- #Question [[Siva Arunagiri]] #Roamans #RoamCult: Suppose if I edit the highlights of books exported from [[Readwise @readwiseio]] to [[Roam Research @RoamResearch]]. Will there be duplicate entries the next time #Readwise does its automatic export. 
    - #Reply-from [[ed marsh]] I'd love a quick loom from someone showing how to do the [[Readwise]] export. love the idea but can't figure it out
        - #Reply-from [[Siva Arunagiri]] You need to be on [[Google Chrome]] for this. Open Readwise.io site and go to Roam Export. You will have an option to fine tune how you want your [[Kindle-Highlights]] exports to look like on your [[Roam]] Page. Once you have checked all, then just click Export to Roam. Viola! Hope this helps.

"Core concepts of Zettelkasten in Roam (🌙 Midnight)" (PST)
"Core concepts of Zettelkasten in Roam (☀️ Noon)" (PST)

{{[[youtube]]: https://youtu.be/iBzIoh4VIz4}}
    - ### ~~🌙 Midnight meeting Zoom~~
        - 🌙 [Midnight meeting - Time Zone Conversion](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20201111T080000&p1=137&p2=250&p3=307&p4=152)
    - ### ☀️ Noon meeting Zoom link→ [Join here!](https://zoom.us/j/97351173909)
        - ☀️ [Noon meeting - Time Zone Conversion](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20201111T200000&p1=137&p2=250&p3=307&p4=152)
    - Agenda:: Diving further into the core concepts, with a more hands-on approach, sharing, exploring, and asking the hard questions.
        - 1. Learning the mechanics of creating #[[Fleeting Notes]] through guided facilitation
        - 2. Explore the idiosyncratic way other community members structure this first step
        - 3. Create momentum by planning how to incorporate your workflow into your daily life
- #Question[[Mike Kramer]]Is [**this**](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/%C2%A7Corporate_research_lab_practices) note from [[Andy Matuschak]] an example of a {{alias:((UuMRDEmqT))type 1 connection}}?
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] interesting! I'd say yes
    - I really like this distinction. I almost want to call it something else for my own nomenclature - something more descriptive. a `gateway note` maybe. It's a great concept - the idea that your own graph will eventually need "doors" that you can step into for a refresher after a long period away from a topic. 
- #Question [[Siva Arunagiri]] What is your criteria for creating new graph on [[Roam]]? 
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] When I want to create a definitive firewall between my current [[Zettelkasten]] and the new conversation that I'd like to take place.
- #Question[[Mike Kramer]] Sönke suggests that the how-to of the Zettelkasten  can be described in a single sentence: {{alias:((FP19rL5EA))read texts, take notes on that reading, connect those notes}}. Can the why of the Zettelkasten be adequately described in a single sentence? 
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] I think so, just as long as it's empowering enough to provide the motivation to follow-through on the __how __to achieve that __why__--in a consistent manner, over time
        - The biggest drop-off I continue to see is when users adopting this new technique from a copy-paste manner, is that the adapting of someone else's way of lacks ~~coherent~~ congruency with oneself
        - Which happens a lot, since intelligence is a predictor of how well someone is able to see and solve patterns, so of course, the route of adopt→ adapt makes the most sense... but maybe with this system, especially since it's such a personal dialogue, ought to be slowed down~ 
- #Chat [[Chinarut]] #invitation heads up I created a #support page to #experiment with corralling unique features and requests that come from our #multiplayer experiment - everyone is welcome to create TODOs to support your book club experience and massage the page around
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]  [[@[[Chinarut]]]] this looks great! thanks for sharing your thoughts on this. I really like the idea of attaching a TODO to these requests - so they become in effect kind of like open "support" tickets - especially helpful if we want to just look at unanswered help-requests for example
        - is there any benefit to using `# support` rather than `# help` which I think is the current convention?
        - i.e. would those serve different functions?
        - for example, do we want a separate tag for "technical support" versus "book club question" maybe? not sure yet
    - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] [[~[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]] thanks for the quick feedback!  I didn’t realize [[I Need Help!]] surfaced recently!  perhaps a distinction we can try:
        - [[I Need Help!]] classic, go-to help page/forum. questions all in one place leading to an FAQ
            - one place for beginners, newbies, and even power-users (who get lost too!)
            - `# help` could optionally be used to join the two approaches and track questions that still remain unanswered
        - `# support` distributed, query model inserting requests in place (“in graph”)
            - maintains flow, one asks “in the moment” as they take notes (or read)
            - naturally provides surrounding context
            - more advanced, experimental model for those who like the fringes
    - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] I’m clear after contributing to our help page, a single page for questions has a clear role.  As an #experiment, I created an attribute table to see how a bottom-up summarization process might look like in #support and inserted the demo video I created in [[in-graph support experience]] as a placeholder.  [[@[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]]
    - #Question [[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]] Are [[fleeting notes]] necessary when working in Roam? Sönke says [If your thoughts are already sorted and you have the time, you can skip this step (of taking fleeting notes) and write your idea directly down as a proper, permanent not for your slip-box.](((pZ1dkTn5N)))
        - I tend to think of [[fleeting notes]] as a way to capture ideas without breaking the flow of reading. They are breadcrumbs.
        - Perhaps the road to a permanent note can happen immediately when the idea arises?
        - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] yes, fleeting notes are trashable & support keeping you in the moment (the mind wants to hold on so we jot down something quick to let go). I think as we get practiced as to what constitutes a “permanent” note - we can go immediately to it. I think while we are learning, IMHO, it is important to do **all** the steps and be clear, for ourselves, the distinction of fleeting -> literature -> permanent notes. [[@[[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]]]]
