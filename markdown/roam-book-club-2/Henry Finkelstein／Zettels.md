                - It is preferable to work in a breath-giving and energizing dynamic.
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                - This reminds me of the [[Good to Great]] concept of the flywheel - once we have enough critical momentum then the work takes on an accelerating quality of it's own that is a positive virtuous cycle of achievement
                - I like the reach for the [[intuitive]] quality of how this "feels". Pointing to the "feel-good" state of a mental space that feels clean and productive is very compelling. In some ways, this points back to "selling" from [[Daniel Pink]]'s [[To Sell is Human]]
                - Also reminds me of [[effortless effort]] concept from [[Zen Buddhism]] which is in turn akin to [[flow state]] where hard work begins to feel effortless and light

        - The quality of one's writing depends on the quality of one's notes before one starts writing.

        - I really appreciate this concept and it reminds me of the Zen buddhist saying of "how you do one thing is how you do every thing"
            - If we can atomize our tasks well, and then do each of them well, then strong execution is an expected emergent outcome of such a system
        - I like this concept as it continues to resonate throughout the book. If I am diligent and consistent in taking smart notes on everything I consume, then I will become increasingly sharp and well-researched in my writing (and thinking!) over time.
        - This also plays in, slightly, to the idea of the accumulation of smart notes over time.
