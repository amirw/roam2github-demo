        - What's [[Beau Haan]]s email address?
            - [[Reply]] [[Beau Haan üìå]] My email is: beauhaan@beauhaan.com üòÖ
                - [[Reply]] Thanks, [[Beau Haan]]! I did not expect to get an answer to this question.

    - [[Goals of Book Club]] Expectations in four weeks time, ... 
        - Having read the book completely and made some notes. Then compared these with other people notes, what they think which parts/blocks are interesting.
        - Reading about thoughts which I did not come up myself. (might by obvious if you read a lot of people notes on a specific subject)
        - Having read the book, is my note taking actually improving? Does it have any effect at all?
        - Might be not a goal but an interesting statistics: I'm going to log the time and duration whenever I read in [[How to Take Smart Notes]]. 
            - **Is there a pattern emerging?** 
            - Do I read in the evening/morning/during lunchbreak (no, very likely not)?
        - I definitely want to use the block referencing feature more. I have not really used it before, even though I know it exists. 
        - I think the [[plugins/(rand)]] feature might be really useful when I have read the book. It's like having someone randomly tell you a short piece of that book and then I can write down anything that comes to mind.

        - "How is your progress towards your initial goals? Or have they changed?"
            - So, I definitely need to define some form of schedule to get some fixed reading time. Otherwise I just won't make it.
        - "Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? "
            - Very hard for me. But this is just my own fault as I'm not reserving time to do this. I need to combine this with some other task I'm already doing daily. Personally, I think the best time to do this is in the morning and before work. 
            - I should get up earlier so I can carve out time for reading, note taking and thinking.

- [[Book Club Live Session 7]]
    - Section 1 [[Writing practice]]
        - "You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say? "
            - A Zettelkasten is a tool to manage information and to develop thoughts over a longer period of time. You can store information in one central place and connect pieces of information, Zettel, with other related information. Folgezettel can either contribute to an argument/thought or they can be contradicting to the previous Zettel. In either way connections between different areas will surface where you did not expect them.
        - "Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?"
            - Yes. Taking notes at all in a fixed format and into a fixed place. Though I need to form a habit to continue with note taking while reading a book. I might start experimenting with reading and highlighting first and then transferring them into a permanent note. The approach I took while reading the physical book, taking notes (no highlights) with the page number on the ReMarkable and then transferring them into Roam at the same day, worked pretty well.
        - "What's your favourite blocks (or quotes) from the book?"
            - The one who does the work does the learning,‚Äù writes Doyle (2008, 63). #quote [*](((Vt4Ml7MCT)))

    - Section 2 - Breakout
        - with [[Yingyue Liu]], [[Gleb Reys]], [[William Njau]]
        - Zettelkasten can transform many more areas than just writing. It affects teaching, learning and anything which relys on structured notes.
        - No need to reread a book because __all__ relevant information are in the Zettelkasten summarized in your own notes.

            - Tagging
            - Relate - can I relate the notes to any other notes?

        - Zettel is a declarative statement which can be __true or false__. 
        - Zettelkasten expresses who your are and how your thinking works.
        - "Have we finished? Do you feel you have clarity about the Zettelkasten process in Roam? "
            - I think I have clarity about what the Zettelkasten is enabling for me. The process itself, how do get from a book, article, blog post, paper, ... to a Zettel and how to link them, is not 100% clear yet. I really like [[Beau Haan]]s idea how to structure the Zettel with an index to quickly see where the conversation is going, as well as the structure of a Zettel to have the fleeting notes, literature notes and the reference notes available for each Zettel without going to another page or moving around to much.

        - Questions
            - "(what use cases does it work for? Are there any examples it doesn't work for?)"
                - I'm looking forward to explore the Zettelkasten method with very technical information. 
                    - As far as I've seen, the Zettelkasten process works very well in developing thoughts over a longer period of time and discovering unforeseen connections or contradictions of information where I did not think of them.
                    - With __technical information__ I think of network protocols, how they interact, how they relate, and similiar questions.
        - General review questions
            - "Reflect on your impressions of the book "
                - Great book with a lot of details and a few very well choosen examples.
                - The capters are kept at a nice size which allows rereading selected chapters if I'm looking for some specific information.
            - "Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?"
                - Plan making notes which aim to fit into the Zettelkasten. Get rid of __standalone notes__
            - "Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?  "
                - Yes! Absolutely. Getting started is always the hardest part because no zettels exist yet and there are no __conversations__ going on. But this will change.

            - small differences, might make big differences in long run
            - easier to get back into the ideas, when working with ideas.
            - used pages for note sequences ([[Folgezettel]])
                - now with roam much more free to add things on the same page because of the granular level of blocks.
        - Is there a problem with too many backlinks of a page?
            - being more strict,explicit,.. with tagging? to filter later?

        - I'm looking forward to explore the Zettelkasten method with very technical information. 
            - As we've seen, the Zettelkasten process works very well in developing thoughts over a longer period of time and discovering unforeseen connections or contradictions of information where we did not think of them.

        - What is your goal when you read the book?
            - Do you want to collect and connect new ideas to old ones? Then it might be worth to take more notes and start building a [[Zettelkasten]]
            - If you are __just__ trying to put it into practice, you might take less notes and experiment more with the main idea.
    - With Blockreferencing you can actually write longer notes and block reference them later. Recombine them. Reference them like a note.
    - Individual vs collective [[Zettelkasten]]
        - There should be a clear distinction between these two. If you write your own Zettelkasten, you get very familiar with your notes and ideas. You know where and what is in your Zettelkasten
        - collective notes might be a very cool experiment. Taking notes together. See what emerges from it. Might be less suitable for creating your own [[Zettelkasten]]. This is your thinking.

    - Motivation is not maintained by clinging to set goals, but rather comes from unforeseen ideas and insights. -p.13

    - Get into the __Flow__. Book by [[Csikszentmihalyi]] -p.14
    - When you have read more about a topic, you also develop higher demands on your work.

This increases the writing effort. -p.15
    - "Those who hardly read need no strategy to avoid being overwhelmed by the quantity of references and sources. Those who have never made the effort to record their thoughts know nothing of the problem of organizing them in such a way that they will be found again at the right time. -p.15

    - You can't write the same notes and just keep them in a note box. This doesn't make writing any easier, and it won't produce better ideas. You have to change the way you design your notes. S.19

    - Work steps - p.30
        1. fleeting notes are not kept.
        2. for read literature, the most important aspects and concise summaries are prepared and stored in the bibliography with page references and sources.
        3. [[Permanent Notes]] are created from the literature notes. These are readable and understandable in an understandable form and without context. References for already existing notes should also be searched for and created here.
        4. as an extra step the active search for connections with other notes is also suitable. The [[slip of paper]], create cross-references.
        5. from this search open questions or questions can arise. You can also see areas of interest with many notes
        6. now a continuous text can be formulated and gaps in argumentation chains can be filled. As well you have to make connections between your lines of thought of the different notes.
        7. the last step is always the revision of the text. Here you can work on formulations or correct other inconsistencies. You could repeat this step as often as you like. 
    - **Fleeting notes** are not kept and must be viewed daily or at a fixed time frame and converted to permanent notes if they are important. With notes that you no longer understand, you have forgotten the context and if they seem banal, you have forgotten the reference to your own train of thought. - p.45
    - Only by a consequent writing of the thoughts one has the possibility to develop longer and more complex trains of thought. Also you can read more purposeful, if you will write your notes afterwards, because you already look at the important arguments and points. - p.38
    - #Idea Think everything from writing - p.37
    - It is useless to try to integrate new concepts into already existing workflows. You have to adapt the workflows to the new concept (see example with container in shipping).  - p.39f
    - 3 types of notes -p.41
        - **Volatile notes**: mnemonic only
        - **Permanent notes**: notes formulated with sources annotated and saved in the same format and in the same location #[[Permanent Notes]]
            - Reading notes: Reading notes have a card on the front side with notes in the form of key points and on the back side the page numbers and the content in short form. "Page so and so is this and that" - p.45 
#todo I am not sure if this is so. 
            - __Zettel__: A note is a thought that is formulated in an understandable way and can be understood without context. Likewise, the source is always included. ([Niklas Luhmann]'s were almost ready for printing). - p.45 
        - **Project-related notes**: Reminder until end of project
        - Project-related notes must be separated from other projects and from permanent notes, as these only exist for the duration of the __one__ project and can be either deleted or archived afterwards. - p.46
    - **underlines** are useless, because they do not give context and do not show what is really interesting about this text passage. - p.44
    - In order to find a good topic, one must already have dealt with existing literature and therefore __the process of finding a topic cannot be at the beginning of the often shown __linear__ process: 
    - topic finding -> literature research -> reading -> writing
    - This process also suggests that you always start from scratch for a project, which is never the case. Usually you already have a few notes on a topic, which results in several questions that can be used as a theme and which at the same time can __define the direction of the work, which should therefore be in line with your own interests (motivation).  - p.47
    - Interest in the topic and the questions to be clarified creates motivation, a kind of momentum of its own that must be driven by the project itself and must not be generated externally or by rewards. One should establish **positive feedback effects**, which do not insist on rewards after work is done, as these are a labile construction; rather, the motivation through feedback effects must come from the own work. -p.51
        - Unfortunately, feedback from the professor often comes much too late, so it is important to be aware of one's own successes and failures. 
"Today I have come a long way.
"Today I understood a new topic".
"Today I have made a lot of progress in the conceptual structure of the work".
    - The larger the slip box becomes, the more points of contact it offers for new knowledge and thus it becomes easier to add new notes and link them to already existing knowledge and notes. -p.53
    - The "writing" is also a kind of __multitasking__. It switches between different processes such as reading, understanding, reflecting and forming links. Therefore, these steps have to be separated in the organization as well. It also applies: the more multitasking, the worse you get at it. -p.57.f
    - When writing a text, there are also two ways of looking at it that require different levels of attention
        - author's point of view: To put a train of thought down on paper as precisely as possible and to clarify the subject matter.
        - proofreading: Check the general structure of the text and the argumentation for gaps in content and logic.
    - The ability to switch between these two types of attention distinguishes successful or good scientists. (focused vs. wandering mind)
        - **Focused Attention**: is dedicated to exactly one thing and cannot be maintained for more than a few seconds, e.g. warning light.
        - **Sustained Attention**: the persistent attention is trainable and means the intensive occupation with a topic. Learning also takes place here.
        - The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame (Dean, 2013, p. 153) -p.61 #quote
    - **Zeigarnik effect**: Not finished things occupy mental resources and only when you completely believe to have finished something, mental capacities become free. It makes no difference for the brain whether you have actually done this thing or if you have written it down and come back to it later as long as you are convinced of it (routine). -p.65
        - The method [[Getting Things Done]] by [[David Allen]] builds on this principle by writing down __everything__ in a place that you look at and check again periodically, for example daily, so that you can be sure that you will come back to it later on. -p.65
    - Willpower: [[ego-depletion]] At the moment it is being discussed and investigated whether this is a self fulfilling prophecy (only exists if you believe in it yourself) or an actual effect. -p.66f
    - Reading with a view to the dispersal.
While reading, Niklas Luhmann]] made notes on ideas with source information on the back, and after finishing a book, he checked to what extent these ideas could be linked to already existing pieces of paper in the slip box. Which ideas can be extended (pro or contra doesn't matter)?
    - Handwritten notes have the advantage that they take longer and you have to limit yourself to the essential points in your own words. 
It is also possible to do this digitally, although there is often a tendency to "log everything" rather than writing it in your own words. -p.71
    - [[Confirmation Bias]]: One looks for arguments, which confirm the own believe or world-view. -p.72
        - The [[Confirmation Bias]] argues against a topic finding at the beginning of the scientific process, because this is the perfect way to create conditions for the [[Confirmation Bias]].
        - Charles Darwin]] has __always__ routinely written down counter-arguments against his opinions and dealt with them. -p.73
    - __The principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest person to fool.__ - ([Richard Feynman]], 1985, p. 342) -p.74 #quote
    - In order to recognize the essential points and frames in a text, it is helpful to describe the described thing once again in your own words and to think exactly what is meant by a statement of the author and what __not__ is meant. What and what __not__ does the author want to address? This requires [[Deliberate Practice]] and was also handled in this way by [[Niklas Luhmann]]. -p.76
    - __The one who does the work does the learning.__ ([[Doyle]], 2008, p.63) -p.77 #quote
        - After all, you don't hire a personal coach to lift the weights. Nor do you go to the gym with the intention of getting by with as little effort as possible. Why do we want to learn with as little effort as possible?
    - **Elaboration**: What we read must be linked to our own previous knowledge and the meaning for it must be worked out. For example, you internalize the answer to a question much better if you have already thought about the answer before. -p.77 - p.79
    - [[Mere Exposure Effect]]: the mere familiarity with the subject creates the illusion of understanding. For example, [[Cramming]] leads to this, because by reading a text over and over again the brain recognizes both the text and pattern and creates familiarity with the text, which in turn does not reflect understanding. #definition -p.79
    - During the literature research and reading, only the most important things should be recorded and formulated in their own words in an understandable way without necessary context. -p.83
        - Select resources very selectively, use subject databases, new does not mean up-to-date and old can be important as classics. Footnotes and references from texts often lead to very interesting literature. -p.82
    - Dispersal**: Notes are always written with a view to one's own thoughts and considerations, using the literature notes for other notes in the note box. In doing so, one should think beyond what has been read and look for points of reference in the slip box. -p.86
        - To what extent is this relevant for my research/own interests?
        - Why is it written out and remarkable at all?
        - What significance does this information have for another thought that already exists?
    - As soon as a __critical mass__ of slips of paper is reached, the most important question is to what extent the new slip of paper matches other discussions and slips of paper in the slip box. -p.87
    - Only by rewriting what has been read can one understand and learn it. (Literature Notes [[Literature Notes]]). By writing down one's own thoughts one arranges them and checks whether they make sense at all. (#notes) -p.88 
In this way, questions or thoughts that arise can be answered directly or linked to other notes. Further thoughts can be executed directly on a new note as [[Follow-up note]]. -p.90
    - Learning Research
        - Storage Strength: Storage capacity. Increases continuously (definitely in the card tray). Likewise [[Bjork]] makes the argument, that the storage capacity can only increase and never decrease, although our brain is not yet able to check this. ([Bjork]], 2011) -p.94
        - Retrieval Strength: Re-remembrance depends on the number and type of associations (context, smell, environment, sounds) of the information. Therefore, it is also important to elaborate information in as many different environments as possible, i.e. to link information with a context and meaning. -p.94

    - To improve the later classification and understanding of information, it helps not to learn (or be presented with) new information in a systematic order. -p.97
    - Every note can be found either directly via the index or via references. -p.98
    - Single notes get a meaning only in connection with other notes in trains of thought ([[Follow-sheet]]). If no [[Follow-up notes]] are created, you get a kind of Wikipedia. But at a certain size, the note box becomes unmanageable, because it represents your own thinking (the note box is the medium in which you think). -p.100
    - [Study.log](https://study.log): Project from Hamburg. Graphical overview of the card tray. However, this itself is not the goal of the card tray, since it is the medium in which one thinks and therefore cannot be represented by definition. Thus, connections can be shown, but this does not contribute to an argumentative text. -p.100
    - Tags should be used sparingly. They facilitate the introduction and overview of a complex topic area if they are written on an introduction note (that note is also only temporary, since new topics and thoughts are always added and removed). -p.101
    - Tags determine the structure in the cardbox and can be assigned in the following two ways, whereby only the author logic is useful. This is designed for the later use of the information/notes and not for "saving and forgetting" information.
        - **Author logic**: Under which topics would you like to see this note in the future? In what way does this note have an influence on my own work? -p.102
        - **Storage logic**: Classification into categories and methods -p.102
    - 2 types of references, which are important for the digital card index method: -p.105
        - Collective references: Overview of a subject area. These notes will be created and expanded over time. The index refers to these notes. -p.105
        - Context references: A note refers to another note with a similar or related topic, but created in a different context. -p.105
    - The card box can help to find different definitions of the same word by reflecting and comparing. -p.108
    - If a paradox occurs, it is a hint from the card box that perhaps not enough thought has been given to a certain topic. -p.109
    - **Verifying procedure**: This is a non-scientific procedure in which an author searches for sources that support his own thesis (see [[Karl Propper]] 1994) -p.110 #definition
    - **Index card method**: The disadvantage of this method is that the information remains separate and cannot be linked in a network of information and related topics. Memory research shows that by creating networks we can remember information much better. -p.110
    - According to [[Charlie Munger]], information that is not connected in a mental model or network is not available in a usable form. A network is a grid with different theories (mental models) with which information and experiences can be linked. -p.111
        - What exactly is a "mental model"? #question see p.111
    - active vs. passive knowledge: As with vocabulary, knowledge can be divided into active (self-applicable and usable) and passive (heard of but not available in usable form). -p.112
    - Tips for learning from [[Helmut D. Sachs]] -p.112
1. pay attention to what you want to remember.
2. properly encode the information you want to keep.
3. practice recall.
    - New information must be linked to known information. In order to remember them, one should look at the information after different times (spacing), try to remember an information actively (retrieval) and look at information in different contexts (variation) and this should also be kept as random as possible (contextual interference).
The work with the card box reflects this in the following way: In the phase of [[elaboration]] the content must be understood in order to extract and note the essential points. Through the work with [[Zettels]] a spacing takes place at irregular intervals. If a note is used or attached to it, it must be remembered (retrieval). Likewise, a different context can be present for new notes (variation). Random ideas or a broad arsenal of interests also confront Zettels with new contexts that are as random as possible (contextual interference). -p.112
    - It is not only important to connect seemingly unrelated ideas and thoughts by hidden similarities, but also to recognize small differences between seemingly identical ideas. -p.114
    - Abstraction is an important step for new ideas, creation of analogies and comparisons, which is why only the essential is written down on pieces of paper. -p.116
    - Influence own thinking; problems in own thinking
        - To build feedback loops into your own thinking shows you your own mistakes and errors. This leads to a [[Growth Mindset]] (see [[Carol Dweck]]) instead of a [[Fixed Mindset]].  -p.116          
        - The own perception must be examined exactly, since our perception never corresponds to reality, but is always only an interpretation of it -p.117
        - We systematically ignore failure and focus only on positive examples (e.g. successful managers, inventors, start-ups) -p.118
            - About the Lessons of Failure: [[What Where They Thinking]] by [[McMath]]  #bookRecommendation
    - [[Feature-Positive Effect]]: This effect describes a strong focus on the present things, forgetting absent/not directly visible details. #definition -p.118
Example: The places of an airplane without bullet holes should be armored the strongest, because obviously only the airplanes returned, which are considered now. The other airplanes did not survive this damage at these places and crashed.
    - When writing the notes the following questions should be asked to also consider the negative space ([Feature-Positive Effect]):
1. what if... (versus the factual situation)?
2. are there similar problems for which a solution already exists?
3. what is hidden here? 
4. did you only grasp an idea or did you also understand the underlying concepts? -p.119
    - The structure of the card box restricts in the structure of thinking, not in the content, which, somewhat counterintuitive, is conducive to ideas and creativity.
**Science**: Only by establishing that experiments have to be repeatable and comprehensible, theses could be compared with each other according to similarities and differences, and based on this, our current state of knowledge could be reached.
**Twitter**: Limitation to the maximum number of characters can also spark a dynamic.
**Book**: Nobody is disappointed if he opens a book and finds the same alphabet he already knows. Only by limiting the number of characters could poems, essays and novels be written that differ considerably in their content. -p.122
    - Each [[Zettel]] is written as [[follow-up Zettel]] for one or more [[Zettels]]. Between these notes there are cross-references to other notes with related topics in possibly different contexts. Each note can be found indirectly via the index or via a reference to an overview note. All tags are assigned from the [[author's view]], so that they reappear in later topics. During tagging and sorting, a new note is created with explanations and thoughts about duplications, similarities and contradictions. Notes are not collected in isolation, but developed into trains of thought. -p.123

    - [[Introduction]]
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - "A good structure is something you can trust. It relieves you from the burden of remembering and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas. By breaking down the amorphous task of ‚Äúwriting a paper‚Äù into small and clearly separated tasks, you can focus on one thing at a time, complete each in one go and move on to the next one (Chapter 3.1). A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). Something like that does not happen by chance."
