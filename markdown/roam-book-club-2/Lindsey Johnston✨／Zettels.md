- #[[Zettels]] [[by turning the first step of taking fleeting notes into a habit, the rest of the steps become easier and the obvious advantages reveal themselves quickly, making old note-taking habits a thing of the past without much effort]]
    - #[[Literature Notes]] [Chapter 14. (Paragraph 6))](((4hIM0I_l_)))
        - Turning this first step (taking fleeting notes) into a habit should not require much effort because it A) makes the rest of the steps easier, which then B)  reveals the overall advantages quickly and obviously (making the habit satisfying).
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] mindfully build new habits you __want__ to intuitively do by having a clear understanding of / emotional connection to the advantages over the old habits. James Clear advises making new habits obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying (the rest of the smart notes process will come more easily).
        - strategically- mindfully build new habits (on purpose / purposefully)
        - habits can replace old ones when they are habits you WANT to do (enjoy doing so much that it makes no sense to ever go back to the old habits)
        - [[Atomic Habits]], all the really tough behavioral habits I'm working hard to make/break in my life
        - if we've already written down "the most important and interesting aspects" whenever we read something, it naturally makes the rest of the process easier[*](((HcgCq7lKE)))
            - turn what we've written down into permanent notes & connect them with other notes in the slip-box
        - external memory of notes - second brain?
        - I hope to develop this routine
