- Yup - eventually I'll put some details in
- [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
    - [[Goals of Book Club]]
        - I would like to develop my own practice
            - I work with very live and interesting people and I am constantly researching topics to keep engaged with them - keeping notes, linking them all together and being able to reference them is an essential part of this process
            - I'd also like to be able to get back to producing more articles. 
            - For reading
                - Reading smarter
                - I have a nasty habit of reading as a form of life-avoidance - so the stuff I am reading maybe really valuable but I am getting wasted on it. 
        - I'm also very interested in group processes in the production of cultural (& other knowledge based) artefacts 
            - How do you collectively write something, for example, and 
            - how can perspectives from diverse members of a collective help us in producing our individual work. 
        - Connecting to others in the community
            - and even becoming aware of it as a community
        - "Reflect on your Zettel process"
            - Some recent struggles
                - This last week I realised that I was trying to overlay two quite distinct writing processes. Old and new. Effectively I was writing something then going back over it and abstracting blocks to then develop into zettles - and becoming confused. 
                - Working forward from fleeting notes on something I am reading, then later developing literature notes and from there creating zettles - that has been working, but slowly.
                - I haven't reached critical mass to make this productive yet, and consequently I am also somewhat under-motivated.
                - I've not yet learned how to connect them together, to think within the slip-box, which is also related to critical mass.
                - I'm linking it to my working practices with clients, which feels like a major leap, although with so much change going on I am finding myself loosing sleep in excitement and ridiculously tired
                - I am lacking a sense of play and space to breathe. I'll catch up with myself though
