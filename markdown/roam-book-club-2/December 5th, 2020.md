- #Announcement Oh, this is totally cool - now hovering over a bullet actually yields the NAME of the person who wrote it, not their email address, as used to be the case. that's so much more helpful... Yay, go team Roam with the quality-of-life improvements!

Also, a favor to ask, can someone who is NOT in my time zone (US West Coast PST) please hover over the bullet point for this block and tell me whether it yields local time, or time of the person who wrote it? 

For me, it say 05:51. In another time zone what does it say? TIA - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]
    - #Reply-from [[Nicole Drumhiller]] I'm in PST and when I hover over the announcement (currently 10:09am) it says 5:51:09, though it appears that my reply bullet has my email address vs my name.
    - #Reply-from [[Max Kunzelmann]] I'm in UTC+1 and it says 14:51, so it should be local time.
    - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] thanks, Max and Nicole! so if I understand correctly, it tells each of us when a block was created __translated into our own local time zone__, which is functionally what I want/expect it to do - thank you for clarifying.
        - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] this is great!  I canâ€™t wait for daily notes to get the same treatment too!
            - "#inquiry how will Roam handle internationalization?"

    - I haven't been able to join the live sessions due to the time, but where can I get all the session recordings? I can only find ones for the first and second session.
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] Follow this page toâ†’ [[Video]]
- [[Zettels]] are basically chapter-summaries of the book you would write in the future.
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] Ah, interesting!  Do I understand this correctly as "Zettels are chapter summaries of a book, not yet written, that you might one day choose to write"? 

I think that's a nice formulation, it captures the personal essence that's necessary, i.e. "This is a key idea that I have learned, and one day I might elaborate on it with a whole chapter" - I like that!
    - #Reply-from [[William Njau]] I like this idea as well. I would add that they can also be viewed as the 'topic sentences' of the paragraphs of the book not yet 'formally written'
        - Yes! This is a great insight from my perspective.
