    - [[Introduction]]
        - This book aims to fill the gap between reading and having to write by showing you how to efficiently and systematically turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way.  [*](((baDCUDIxD))) [*](((bcLxLxc5s)))
        - Take notes. Write everything down. This is the secret sauce. The writing falls into place once this step of the system is integrated into your work. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=158)) [*](To sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=158)))
            - See also [[Atomic Habits]] where the notion of environment and accessibility are seen as keys to effective changes in behaviour aka #Habit formation.  [*](((tIetkYe5Q))) 
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - ... a system is needed to keep track of the ever-increasing pool of information, which allows one to combine different ideas in an intelligent way with the aim of generating new ideas. ([Location 224](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=224))
        - Students are ill-prepared (due to the usual way academic writing is taught) for the task of writing research papers. [*](((LTX79DEgy)))
        - Keep the process of note-taking simple; the contents of ideas are complex enough. 
        - #Writing and thinking are not linear processes but a systematic, interlinked approach is vital to maintain order. [*](((KlQ2ZK7UD)))
            - Writing is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forth between different tasks.
        - Luhmann created a "dialogue partner" with the invention of the slip-box. Inter-relatedness and contextual meaning are vital to the success of this process.  [*](((QjpYnMkul)))
        - Stay open, flexible - and in control - during the writing process. In this way,  small adjustments are possible. [*](((oz882t9yv)))
            - The right workplace and the smart workflow is the best antidote to resistance - the great enemy of creativity. ([[See The War of Art]] by [[Steven Pressfield]] for more on this.)  [*](((hhTaHBEnz)))
        - A general misunderstanding has to do with the focus not on the workflow but on the notes themselves.  [*](((j85ILtzRh)))
        - Modern software has simplified Luhmann's paper slip-box with Index entry points. Roam enables this via tagging and bi-directional links. "The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points."
    - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
        - As you write you are thinking about relevance and ideas. If you want to understand something write it in your own words - externalise the idea via paper or keyboard. [*](((RN5JKBqxJ)))
            - 2.1      Writing a paper step by step ([Location 508](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=508))
                - 1. [[Fleeting Notes]] - as the name suggests grab them on the run - phone memo, back of an envelope, your notebook - and put them anywhere but transfer them as soon as possible to your system (here Roam) [*](((pZ1dkTn5N)))
                - 2. 2. Make[[Literature notes]]. These are short and selective and in your own words - one idea per note - and stored and marked/tagged with reference to the source [*](((eRojO1adJ)))
                - 3 and 4. Make [[Permanent Notes]]. Don't just collect notes but focus on what triggers your existing or maybe extends or links your interests in a new way. One note per idea as if you were writing for another person, and provide links (index) for connectivity and retrieval. Throw away the fleeting notes at this stage. Ahrens suggests they don't matter now.  [*](((y5dDNqTm7)))
                - 5. Start with what you have rather than attempting to brainstorm for a topic. Trust that topics will emerge from your previously filed permanent notes and you can build upon these. Stay open to new pathways connecting your ideas; stay loose and flexible. [*](((erCjnBgLf)))
                - 6 and 7. Gather your ideas - the permanent notes - into wherever you are writing. Cull for redundancies and check for what is missing. Go back and read and take further notes to expand on your developing topic.  [*](((WUwVRqAv7)))
                - 7 and 8 This is the rough draft stage - the assembling of notes. It will require a coherent alignment with your idea. Cull and rewrite if you have to. The final stage is editing and proof-reading. Voila! A paper has emerged from note-taking in a logical and systematic way. [*](((1bH-TT58u)))
        - As you read and stumble upon something unexpected, remember never let a good idea go to waste or an intriguing assertion get away. You never know what it could mean down the track. Note it.  [*](((20T97LXDY))) 
        - Create a critical mass of ideas which, when bumping up against one another, can create a dynamic compost to enrich your writing.  [*](((-1TPFSwyN))) 
        - We don't know what we don't know. We often stumble upon ideas which turn out to be goldmines or sparks to the development of something new. [*](((6mdYRieSi))) 
    - [[Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have]]
        - To have an undistracted brain to think with and a reliable collection of notes to think in is pretty much all we need. Everything else is just clutter. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=615))
            - 3.1      The Tool Box ([Location 617](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=617))
                - 1.  You need something to capture ideas whenever and wherever they pop into your head. ([Location 629](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=629))
                - 2.  The reference system has two purposes: To collect the references (duh) and the notes you take during your reading. ([Location 635](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=635))
                - 3.  The slip-box. ([Location 646](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=646))

        - Tools are only as good as your ability to work with them. ([Location 665](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=665))
    - [[The Four Underlying Principles]]
        - [[Chapter 5. Writing is the Only Thing That Matters]]
            - Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=702))
            - The criteria for a convincing argument are always the same, regardless of who the author is or the status of the publisher: They have to be coherent and based on facts. ([Location 716](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=716))
            - If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to work as if nothing else counts than writing. ([Location 719](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=719))
            - Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently. ([Location 727](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=727))
            - You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don’t understand what it is about. ([Location 734](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=734))
            - Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008). ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=737))
        - [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
            - We tend to think that big transformations have to start with an equally big idea. But more often than not, it is the simplicity of an idea that makes it so powerful (and often overlooked in the beginning). ([Location 744](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=744))
            - The slip-box is the shipping container of the academic world. Instead of having different storage for different ideas, everything goes into the same slip-box and is standardised into the same format. ([Location 791](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=791))
            - The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=797))
            - It can only play out its strengths when we aim for a ([Location 800](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=800)) critical mass, which depends not only on the number of notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled. ([Location 801](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=801))
            - ### Kinds of Notes #[[Important]]
                - 1.  Fleeting notes, ([Location 804](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=804))
                    - Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=844))
                    - Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else. ([Location 838]https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=838))
                        - **Note**: is this the equivalent of the scribbled note or highlight?
                - 2.  Permanent notes, ([Location 806](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=806))
                    - In contrast to the fleeting notes, every permanent note for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece, but that can not be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments. ([Location 864](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=864))
                    - The only permanently stored notes are the literature notes in the reference system and the main notes in the slip-box. ([Location 854](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=854))
                    - Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=848))
                - 3.  Project notes, ([Location 809](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=809))
                    - Project-related notes can be:   ·      
                        - comments in the manuscript ·      
                        - collections of project-related literature ·      
                        - outlines ·      
                        - snippets of drafts ·      
                        - reminders ·      
                        - to-do lists ·      
                        - and of course the draft itself. ([Location 877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=877))
            - Only because every note is in the same format at the same place can they later be combined and assembled into something new and no thought is ever wasted on the question of where to put or label it. ([Location 870](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=870))
        - [[Chapter 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch]]
            - When addressing the way to learn through writing and note-taking, root the course of action in reality instead? ([Location 918](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=918))
            - Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. Basically, that is what Hans-Georg Gadamer called the hermeneutic circle (Gadamer 2004). ([Location 922](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=922))
            - Even though academic writing is not a linear process, that does not mean you should follow an anything-goes approach. On the contrary, a clear, reliable structure is paramount. ([Location 980](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=980))
        - [[Chapter 8. Let the Work Carry You Forward]]
            - Feedback loops are not only crucial for the dynamics of motivation, but also the key element to any learning process. ([Location 1007](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1007))
            - Dweck shows convincingly that the most reliable predictor for long-term success is having a “growth mindset.” ([Location 1010](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1010))
            - To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (and happiness) in the long run. Conversely, nothing is a bigger hindrance to personal growth than having a “fixed mindset.” ([Location 1011](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1011))
            - Having been praised for what they are (talented and gifted) rather than for what they do, they tend to focus on keeping this impression intact, rather than exposing themselves to new challenges and the possibility of learning from failure. ([Location 1015](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1015)) #Learning
            - the fear of failure has the ugliest name of all phobias: Kakorrhaphiophobia. ([Location 1020](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1020))
            - Having a learning system in place that enables feedback loops in a practical way is equally important. ([Location 1022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1022))
            - feedback loops are usually smaller than one big chunk of feedback at the end, they are also much less scary and easier to embrace. ([Location 1029](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1029))
            - Expressing our own thoughts in writing makes us realise if we really thought them through. ([Location 1042](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1042))
    - [[The Six Steps to Successful Writing]]

            - 9.2      Multitasking is not a good idea ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1085))
                - productivity and the quality of the work decreases with multitasking, but that it also impairs the ability to deal with more than one thing at a time! ([Location 1099](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1099))
                - Trying to multitask fatigues us and decreases our ability to deal with more than one task. ([Location 1104](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1104))
                - It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time. ([Location 1115](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1115))
            - 9.3      Give Each Task the Right Kind of Attention ([Location 1135](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1135))
                - It is not a sign of professionalism to master one technique and stick to it no matter what, but to be flexible and adjust one’s reading to whatever speed or approach a text requires. ([Location 1173](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1173))
                - In short, academic writing requires the whole spectrum of attention. To master the art of writing, we need to be able to apply whatever kind of attention and focus is needed. ([Location 1175](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1175))
                - The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.” (Dean, 2013, 152) ([Location 1186](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1186))

                - academic writing is an art, as well, which means it is something we can become better at with experience and deliberate practice. ([Location 1210](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1210))
                - To be able to become an expert, we need the freedom to make our own decisions and all the necessary mistakes that help us learn. ([Location 1217](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1217))
                - Gut feeling is not a mysterious force, but an incorporated history of experience. ([Location 1243](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1243))
            - 9.5      Get Closure ([Location 1259](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1259))
                - We can hold a maximum of seven things in our head at the same time, plus/minus two (Miller 1956). ([Location 1264](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1264))
                - Things we understand are connected, either through rules, theories, narratives, pure logic, mental models or explanations. ([Location 1282](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1282))
                - The brain doesn't distinguish between an actual finished task and one that is postponed by taking a note. ([Location 1300](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1300))
                - By writing something down, we literally get it out of our heads. ([Location 1301](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1301))
                - one of the main advantages of thinking in writing – everything is externalised anyway. ([Location 1317](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1317))
                - Letting thoughts linger without focusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in a different, often surprisingly productive way. While we have a walk or a shower or clean the house, the brain cannot help but play around with the last unsolved problem it came across. And that is why we so often find the answer to a question in rather casual situations. ([Location 1320](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1320))

                - “We use the term ego depletion to refer to a temporary reduction in the self’s capacity or willingness to engage in volitional action (including controlling the environment, controlling the self, making choices, and initiating action) caused by prior exercise of volition.” (Baumeister et al., 1998, 1253) ([Location 1334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1334))
                - it is safe to argue that a reliable and standardised working environment is less taxing on our attention, concentration and willpower, or, if you like, ego. ([Location 1351](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1351))
                - To have a walk (Ratey, 2008) or even a nap[24] supports learning and thinking.[25] ([Location 1366](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1366))

                    - “If one were to attempt to identify a single problematic aspect of human reasoning that deserves attention above all others, the confirmation bias would have to be among the candidates for consideration” (Nickerson 1998, 175). ([Location 1469](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1469))
                    - This is a good rule of thumb: If insight becomes a threat to your academic or writing success, you are doing it wrong. ([Location 1488](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1488))
                    - Confirm that we have separated tasks and focus on understanding the text we read; Make sure we have given a true account of its content;    Find the relevance of it and make connections.

                - The brain also doesn’t store information neurally and objectively. We reinvent and rewrite our memory every time we try to retrieve information. The brain works with rules of thumb and makes things look as if they fit, even if they don’t. It remembers events that never happened, connects unrelated episodes to convincing narratives and completes incomplete images. It cannot help but see patterns and meaning everywhere, even in the ([Location 1745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1745)) most random things (cf. Byrne, 2008).

                - Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a #Memory, but the erection of a mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory.

                - If we instead focus on “retrieval strength,” we instantly start to think strategically about what kind of cues should trigger the retrieval of a memory. ([Location 1877](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1877))

                - The first step of elaboration is to think enough about a piece of information so we are able to write about it. The second step is to think about what it means for other contexts as well. ([Location 1913](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1913))
                - If you focus your time and energy on understanding, you cannot help but learn.

                - The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference. ([Location 2022](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2022))

                - Sometimes, the confrontation with old notes helps to detect differences we wouldn’t have noticed otherwise.

                - (Sachs 2013, 26) His recommendations for learning read almost like instructions for the slip-box: 1.  Pay attention to what you want to remember. 2.  Properly encode the information you want to keep.

                - We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications (elaboration), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), ideally with the help of chance (contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort (retrieval).

- Live Session 7 [[December 13th, 2020]]
    - "You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say? "
        - Imagine a big repository of ideas that relate to your interests. You have a way of flipping through them and seeing how they might be connected. Some people call it a "second brain" but it's one that can be accessed reliably, unlike the brain which loves to play games with connections. Therein lies serendipity, of course. Naturally, I would probably add a bit about its derivation - can't resist showing off! 😃
    - "Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?"
        - Yes and enabled me to learn how to use Roam in the process - to see its potential for linking and referencing. It also encouraged - demanded really - that I establish a daily habit of writing. As Sonke says - spend time at the outset gathering your permanent notes (Evergreens). I found slowly does it to be a better way; actually I had to go slowly but steadily as I was still learning Roam in the process. Doing it this way meant I got a momentum of practice and thinking and clarity of purpose going which has stood me in good stead since. I am currently working on several books at once and have found the speed of my ability to synthesise and stir the thinking pot have increased exponentially.
    - "The book promotes a bottom up approach to note taking, which we have used in Book Club. Reflect on this. How did this feel? "
        - Good - I use Readwise to import my highlights so I had slew of bottom level notes to work with. At this point I realised taking **quality** highlights was more important than just highlighting quickly. This assisted my thinking as I went - thinking ahead to what would be most useful. 
I often find when reading other books that I go straight to a **Permanent** note - a perfect quote which ends up as a Zettel for later.
I tell my students that if you can't express an idea yourself you don't understand it, so Sonke's advice resonated with me.
    - "What's your favourite blocks (or quotes) from the book?"
        -  "Tools are only as good as your ability to work with them."
        - "Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later."
        - " ... the fear of failure has the ugliest name of all phobias: Kakorrhaphiophobia." Ain't that the truth! 😞
        - "It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time."
    - "We went through the process fleeting notes, literature notes, zettels. But the real power comes from connecting them.  "
        - I used tags to link via topic; this generally took care of note to note connections.
    - "Have we finished? Do you feel you have clarity about the Zettelkasten process in Roam? "
        - I think so although it's true, I think, that we are each finding our way through the process. It is individual from the naming conventions through to consideration of our audience, writing style, purpose. For me, the creation of new ideas out of the permanent notes is ongoing - so maybe there is no finish line?
    - "Refer to the #Zettels page. Any favourites? Any why?"
        - Being able to reflect on others' statements was useful.
    - "Reflect on the shared multi-player zettelkasten of Book Club"
        - To be honest, I found this less useful than working in my own graph. I felt overwhelmed sometimes by the breadth of what was being considered. I wonder whether smaller groups working in a multiplayer format (analogous to live seminar sessions) would be more fruitful or, at least, manageable. I loved the live sessions where ideas were traded so it's possibly a personal thing.
- [[December 8th, 2020]] After mulling my own note-taking process (linking, page-making, and tagging) in my private graph, I decided to experiment by incorporating the brilliantly constructed and logical template which [[Beau Haan 📌]] provided in his "[[Guided Writing Template - Apply children as text]]" and insert it into my Readwise highlight import code for books, articles, etc. Works like a charm and has saved time, angst, and tidied up the linking process enormously. Thanks, Beau! 🙏

    1. Reflect on your impressions of the book 
        - A wonderful hand-hold on process but, more importantly, a poetics of learning, and an urging to educators to reflect upon their own methodologies.
    2. Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?
        - Getting used to the terminology was a starting bump along the way - important to get definitions right to clarify thinking - but the individuality that can follow in the (process) footsteps of Luhmann and Ahrens has led to flexibility and discoveries. "Making a beautiful mess" is a mantra of my own learning and advice to my (performing arts) students.
        - Staying calm during all of this has been necessary - the rush to create lots of material (to endgame) got in the way; messy can be/was beautiful, and there are learnings, always. 
        - The upside has been moving my process along - and increasing a daily discipline of reading then learning how this process - let's call it "Zettling" is now solid. Ahrens approach has provided a template for finding my way. There have been models by others that I have begun integrating into my own approach, and I consider this a work in progress.
    3. Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?
        - Absolutely - it's now a habit and part of my daily TODOs.
        - Finding a way that worked for me was/is key to all of this but perhaps the biggest learning has been **don't let highlights/notes taken quickly from a source moulder in the graph** but the importance of actively creating fleeting notes and set that up permanent notes and potential articles. That requires **discipline and daily (almost) attention** - tending the digital garden as some others have called it. 
        - Spending time on this is a habit that needs forming and this has been a challenge. By putting these as TODO s in my Daily Notes page, I've started to get back into the exercise of reading and writing - the most valuable take-away of Book Club 2 for this book and others I have begun in the interim. **It's now a process and, more importantly, a habit.**

    - [[Goals for Book Club]]
        - Clarify and further i.e., get comfortable with my own process on creating notes. Currently the jargon being used across various "How to" platforms can be confusing. This is not a bad thing by any means viz., Sonke's own urging to develop one's own style and approach. The challenges: doing it effectively and efficiently in a multi-player format to serve work across both dimensions.
        - I really enjoyed Sonke's reflection on "an old professor keeping notes in his room" and the academic community's disinterest in what was seen as an eccentric way of researching. It confirms the notion of diversity and flexibility which keep appearing as a sort of "meta" approach to idea formation and innovation and the actual structure of Roam itself.
        - See also the idea of using single word references - hashtags - as a kind of Index page on which the use of this term is clarified cf. a more complex page of a Permanent note. This seems to be the way I am finding my Permanent notes developing atm.
        - 🧠 Collective Intelligence in the Multiplayer environment of Book Club. So far a little overwhelmed at the surges of ideas on establishing #Conventions as we work our way through. I want to stay loose and flexible but understand the importance of conventions as we learn from one another and develop our own (perhaps idiosyncratic) forms of note-taking. 
        - Really also like [[Charlie Mead]] 's plug-in for [[Book Prompts]] - a great way of establishing a daily routine/writing practice but also to work as a collective.
            - [[Writing Prompts]]
                - "When do you plan to read? Where? How often?"
                    - Every day; it's part of my Morning Page prompt. On my iPad for ebooks and on paper.
            - [[Book Prompts]]
                - ""The contemporaries of Henry Ford did not understand why something as simple as the conveyor belt should be that revolutionary. What difference does it make to let the cars move from worker to worker instead of letting the workers walk from car to car? I would not be surprised if some of them even thought of Ford as a bit simpleminded and overly enthusiastic about a rather minor change in work organization. It is only in hindsight that the scale of the advantages of this small tweak became obvious to everyone. I wonder how long it will take until the advantages of Luhmann’s slip-box and work routines become equally obvious to everyone. But by then, everyone will already have known it all along the way." - p. 18"

    - Have been feeling overwhelmed by sheer numbers each weekly live session - frustration with the sync issues - huge graph database so understandable. Stay calm; messy can be beautiful, and there are learnings, always. The upside has been moving my process along - and increasing a daily discipline of reading then learning how to move "Fleets" (highlights) to "Lits" 🌱 to "Perms" 🗂 ["Zettels"]. This process - let's call it "Zettling" is now solid. 
Getting used to the terminology was a starting bump along the way - important to get definitions right to clarify thinking - but the individuality that can follow in the (process) footsteps of Luhmann and Ahrens has led to flexibility and discoveries.
