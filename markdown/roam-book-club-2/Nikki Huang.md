                - Effort invested into quality notes leads to quality output with minimal effort [*](((NFROnc7cy)))
                - Since language is the basis of our thinking, the process of translating ideas into your own language primes them for integration within your map of existing ideas. [*](((G5ZXHLRTw)))
                - Always read with a view towards possible connections with other notes in the slip-box [*](((7kgUv6PAe)))
                    - #quote ^^Luhmann describes this step as follows: “I always have a slip of paper at hand, on which I note down the ideas of certain pages. On the backside I write down the bibliographic details. After finishing the book I go through my notes and think how these notes might be relevant for already written notes in the slip-box. It means that I always read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 150)^^ [*](((jv_5exILk)))
                - The purpose of literature notes is to provide the best possible ingredients for making permanent notes. Therefore, adjust the extensiveness of your notetaking to your purpose and your text. [*](((7_-tgj41Q)))
                - Don't worry if note-taking sometimes takes much longer than you expected: this practice is also the process of understanding. [*](((7_-tgj41Q)))
                - Don't get too caught up in perfecting the process of literature notetaking either. Remember they will also be discarded. The only purpose of literature notes is to help with writing permanent notes. [*](((f0wlzXzRy)))
                - Handwriting rather than typing lecture notes may promote better understanding because the limited speed of handwriting forces you to think in order to record the gist, rather than mechanically trying to record information verbatim. [*](((fxe-n8Txn)))
            - [[10.2 Keep an Open Mind]]
                - Beware of confirmation bias! [*](((JGSJdaEzM)))
                - To avoid confirmation bias, use a bottom-up approach to developing arguments as this frees you from the restrictions of trying to confirm preconceived hypotheses and opens you to surprising insights. Let the decision of what to write about emerge from a slip-box that has attained critical mass [*](((YO0sVbRjO)))
                - Your only tasks in notetaking are to make sure you have understood the text, accurately translated the ideas and connected it to existing ideas in your slip-box. [*](((phEVn_shF)))
                    - Yes - "Always read with a view towards possible connections with other notes in the slip-box [*](((7kgUv6PAe)))" - but this **doesn't** mean to read with any particular note or hypothesis in mind!
                - The only criterion for whether an idea merits a literature note is whether the note can connect existing notes or have potential for new connections. [*](((2J1X0Ixx_)))
                    - But how does this help with being selective? Doesn't absolutely every idea have potential for new connections? #Question
                - If we make having interesting dialogues with/within our slip-box the focus, rather than any particular project or hypothesis, looking for contradictory ideas can be fun. This helps us avoid confirmation bias. [*](((0S4osth0T)))
                    - Darwin forced himself to systematically answer any argument he came across that was critical of his theories. We can adopt the same admirable mindset, but harness the focus on improving our slip-box as a motivator [*](((qc64s9vJP)))
                        - It boils down to the same thing though: since the slip-box is like a [[second brain]], the goal of improving our slip-box is equivalent to the goal of improving our mind #Reflection
            - [[10.3 Get the Gist]]
                - {{[[POMO]]: 25}}
                - The deliberate practice of making permanent notes sharpens our ability to extract and articulate the gist of any text. [*](((TCyRSsTR9)))
                - Expanding your understanding is about expanding your set of mental models, which comes down to identifying new patterns in thought. [*](((xvnduxIMw)))
                    - The ability to identify patterns seems to underpin successful learning in such a diverse range of fields. #Reflection
                - But this dynamic can only start if we ourselves deliberately decide to take on the task of reading and being selective about it, relying on nothing other than our own judgement of what is important and what is not. Textbooks or secondary literature in general cannot take this off our hands, and students who solely rely on them have no chance of becoming “worldly wise.” This is not far off from what philosopher Immanuel Kant described in his famous text about the Enlightenment: “Nonage [immaturity] is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s own mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.” (Kant 1784) [*](((wzyxLhq_8)))
                - When reading and note-taking, ask yourself: What claims underlie this claim, what other claims does this claim preclude if it were true, what distinctions does this term imply? (e.g. Human rights vs. human duties, non-human rights) [*](((0Bo86a-RU)))
                - The ability to detect underlying assumptions, distinctions, critically analyse, reframe assertions and questions is more important than knowledge itself. An optimal note-taking methodology should train us in these skills. [*](((av3ZKApO6)))
                - The better you become in doing this, the quicker you can jot down notes, which are still helpful. Luhmann’s notes are very condensed (Schmidt 2015). With practice comes the ability to find the right words to express something in the best possible way, which means in a simple, but not simplified way. Not only will the readers of your text appreciate your ability to explain something clearly, those you talk to will benefit from this ability as well, as it is not limited to writing. It spills over into speaking and thinking. It is proven that readers regard an author and an audience a speaker as more intelligent the more clear and to the point their expressions are (Oppenheimer 2006). [*](((cHBtAoMcb)))
                    - Oppenheimer, Daniel M. 2006. “Consequences of Erudite Vernacular Utilized Irrespective of Necessity: Problems with Using Long Words Needlessly”. Applied Cognitive Psychology 20 (2): 139–56. [*](((hhC7mv-2k)))
        - [[Chapter 11. Take Smart Notes]]
            - [[11.1 Make a Career One Note at a Time]]
                - The first time one faces the challenge of writing a long text, say a dissertation, it is pretty normal to feel intimidated by the prospective of filling a few hundred pages with well-conceived ideas, source-based research and correct references on every page. If you don’t feel some kind of respect for this task, there is something wrong with you. On the other hand, most people feel that writing a page a day (and having a day a week off) is quite manageable, not realising that this would mean finishing a doctoral thesis within a year–something that does not happen very often in reality. [*](((_nFZ_W66U)))
                - #[[Literature Notes]] Adding 3 quality permanent notes every day is a habit that will provide compound interest returns. 
                    - Comparing the daily habit of adding to the slip-box vs. the daily habit of writing is like comparing saving to investing with compound interest  [*](((3O4hcpRVY)))
                    - Writing six quality permanent notes a day enabled Luhmann's level of productivity. [*](((twrgeVmde))) Even three notes a day would be a great daily productivity goal that can lead to a solid quantity of quality output. [*](((b26SBAbEZ)))
                - The technique of writing a certain amount every day was perfected by Anthony Trollope, one of the most popular and productive authors of the 19th century: He would start every morning at 5: 30 a.m. with a cup of coffee and a clock in front of him. Then he would write at least 250 words every 15 minutes. This, he writes in his autobiography: “allowed me to produce over ten pages of an ordinary novel volume a day, and if kept up through ten months, would have given as its results three novels of three volumes each in the year” (Trollope, 2008, 272). And that, mind you, was before breakfast. [*](((8_XJr9Hvr)))
                - Academic or nonfiction texts are not written like this because in addition to the writing, there is the reading, the research, the thinking and the tinkering with ideas. And they almost always take significantly more time than expected: If you ask academic or nonfiction writers, students or professors how much time they expect it would take them to finish a text, they systematically underestimate the time they need–even when they are asked to estimate the time under the worst-case scenario and if the real conditions turned out to be quite favourable (Kahneman 2013, 245ff). On top of that: half of all doctoral theses will stay unfinished forever (Lonka, 2003, 113). Academic and nonfiction writing is not as predictable as a Trollope novel and the work it involves certainly can’t be broken down to something like “one page a day.” [*](((fAalvJurx)))
            - [[11.2 Think Outside the Brain]]
                - #[[Literature Notes]] Writing good notes may take a long time, but it's a worthwhile investment because this process of slowing down and really crystallising your thoughts tests your understanding and forces you to fill in any gaps or fix any flaws that rapid thought might fly over. Start all your notes with the question **Why did I feel compelled to note these things down?** and follow the chain of questions to arrive at deeper insights.
                    - Taking literature notes is a form of deliberate practice as it gives us feedback on our understanding or lack of it, while the effort to put into our own words the gist of something is at the same time the best approach to understanding what we read. [*](((AmrtUTwuN)))
                    - Taking permanent notes of our own thoughts is a form of self-testing as well: do they still make sense in writing? Are we even able to get the thought on paper? Do we have the references, facts and supporting sources at hand? And at the same time, writing it is the best way to get our thoughts in order. Writing here, too, is not copying, but translating (from one context and from one medium into another). No written piece is ever a copy of a thought in our mind. [*](((tjWCJM6Cr)))
                    - Writing forces you to think more critically and can expose flaws in reasoning or inadequacies in understanding that might pass undetected in thought. [*](((hzPxpEueQ)))
                    - “Well,” the historian said, “the work was done in your head, but the record of it is still here.” “No, it’s not a record, not really. It’s working. You have to work on paper, and this is the paper.”[ 33] [*](((b2JJMuWK1)))
                    - This, obviously, was a very important distinction to Feynman, much more than just a linguistic difference–and for a good reason: It is the distinction that makes all the difference when it comes to thinking. [*](((jME_wwnZk)))
                    - Writing is not just a record of thinking: **Writing is thinking**, but in a more careful and systematic way [*](((BernhIBab)))
                        - “No, no!” Feynman protested. “They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper.” [*](((CenVMab1s)))
                    - #NeuroScience now recognises that our minds are reliant on external scaffolding for any great intellectual output. In the slip-box system, the scaffolding is created by connecting thoughts within the external memory of notes. [*](((2sYG94d4g)))
                    - I took some literature notes collecting reasons how and why humans act so very differently when they experience scarcity. This was step one, done with an eye towards the argument of the book. I had questions in mind like: Is this convincing? What methods do they use? Which of the references are familiar? [*](((_uAV-EOTz)))
                    - Start your literature notes with the question: **Why did these I feel impelled to write these things down in my notes?** Answering this questions will help you make connections to other notes in your slip-box [*](((eNwLWd0n0)))
                    - Skimming through the slip-box while taking notes on your latest text can trigger ideas or questions related to a previous topic you hadn't thought about. In this case, you can note down the connections and revisit them later. This is how new ideas can "emerge" from your slip-box [*](((1yQzlfyLI)))
                    - Starting follow-on literature notes with **why?** is a powerful way to keep the dialogue with the slip-box (and with yourself) going [*](((6UwlWjiRr)))
                    - This line of questioning will lead to more questions, and as your slip-box grows, it will become a good first point of call when looking for answers [*](((0fqdRqSY7)))
                - Start your literature
                - A common way to embed an idea into the context of the slip-box is by writing out the reasons of its importance for your own lines of thought. For example, I recently read the book “Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much” (2013) by Mullainathan and Shafir. They investigate how the experience of scarcity has cognitive effects and causes changes in decision-making processes. They help the reader understand why people with almost no time or money sometimes do things that don’t seem to make any sense to outside observers. People facing deadlines sometimes switch frantically between all kinds of tasks. People with little money sometimes spend it on seeming luxuries like take-away food. From the outside, it would make more sense to do one thing at a time, or buy food in bulk and cook for yourself. The book is interesting, because the authors don’t question this behavior rhetorically or even in a judgemental way, but investigate it as a universal human phenomenon. [*](((KtJWTVMtt)))
            - [[11.3 Learn by not Trying]]
                - #Zettels [[What approach of learning promotes understanding, retention and [[creativity]] (the capacity to generate new ideas)? An approach that encourages [[elaboration]] (ie. connecting ideas into an evergrowing [[latticework]]) rather than [[memorisation]] of atomic or molecular pieces of knowledge, as per the [[flashcard]] [[spaced repetition]] approach]] 
                    - The problem with[[spaced repetition]] is that it only encourages minimal linking between ideas
                        - [[spaced repetition]] is better than no repetition in terms of boosting [[retrieval strength]]. However, the resulting [[retrieval strength]] is weak compared to what we develop through [[elaboration]], because something like a [[flashcard]] might only help you association a small number of {{cues::[[cue]]}} with a single idea, whereas elaboration gives you multiple routes to that idea.
                        - An education system which rewards [[spaced repetition]] style learning must therefore be flawed, as it is rewarding [[memorisation]] over [[elaboration]] 
                    - Can we integrate [[elaboration]] and [[spaced repetition]] to promote both understanding as well as retention and [[retrieval strength]]? [*](((HZpV9jNau)))
                    - [[creativity]] is defined in [[Neuroscience]] as the mixing and remixing of mental representations, involving both convergent and divergent thinking (https://kids.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frym.2017.00019)
                    - #[[Literature Notes]] It's important to build connections rather than just increasing our information [[storage strength]]  because the more connections we build, the more retrieval {{cues::[[cue]]}} we have, and the greater the [[retrieval strength]] of our memory, as we are triggered by various cues to recall information. Our brain makes so many fleeting connections but normally, they would be lost 
                        - Paradoxically, forgetting is crucial to understanding and long-term [[memory]]. [*](((wz1tMENoR)))

                        - A possible explanation of why we seem to forget but can still retrieve memories in great detail when prompted by the right cues: [[active inhibition]] (a mental barrier between the conscious mind and long-term [[memory]]) [*](((l3Z_t0R9K)))
                        - We can conceptualise [[memory]] by distinguishing between [[storage strength]] and [[retrieval strength]][*](((J0FDxuUyD)))
                            - #Reflection Anything that you habitually put in bold = something you probably want to put into square brackets in Roam
                        - Learning is more about [[retrieval strength]] than [[storage strength]]. Especially in the age of Google and information overload, it's less important to remember all the information we encounter, and more important to be able to build connections between atomic units of information. 
                        - Learning is more about [[retrieval strength]] than [[storage strength]]. Especially in the age of Google and information overload, it's less important to remember all the information we encounter, and more important to be able to build connections between atomic units of information. These connections will help us to get around the [[active inhibition]] mechanism and retrieve information from [[memory]] upon encountering the right [[cue]]. [*](((2IObrNCCg)))
                            - [[retrieval strength]] and [[active inhibition]] are fundamental concepts in the psychology of [[conditioning]], which is all about [[learning]] by modifying our responses to {{alias:[[cue]]cues}} #Reflection
                                - Just learnt how to do [alias for page references](https://www.roamtips.com/home/create-aliases-roam-research#:~:text=A%20page%20alias%20allows%20you,any%20anchor%20text%20you%20like.&text=Step%202%3A%20After%20the%20colon,link%2C%20and%20click%20on%20it.)!
                            - This argument provides some psychological underpinnings to key points in [[21 Lessons for the 21st Century]] about the need to transform our outdated education system, which is a relic from the times when [[storage strength]] was more important. [*](((fqbzgEa19))) #Reflection
                    - #[[Literature Notes]] Flashcard [[spaced repetition]] approaches to learning encourage us to recall atomised pieces of information rather than build connections, which is why it might be useful for short or medium-term retention, but not long-term memory. 
                        - This might also be one of the problems with [[flashcard]] [[spaced repetition]] approach to learning, which trains you to recall information upon exposure to very specific {{alias:[[cue]]cues}} (e.g. a keyword, a cloze passage). But because the cues themselves are isolated and not connected to other thoughts or concepts, you never end up building the [[latticework]] of concepts you need to easily recall and make sense of the field as a whole. Building a lattice is the process of [[elaboration]] [*](((AQEyeuXh9))) which allows you many entry points or routes to any given atomic unit of information you might be trying to recall, whereas the flashcard system only gives you a limited number of entry points.

                            - There might be some interesting analogies to [[explore]] here between [[chemistry]] and the process of [[elaboration]] in [[learning]] #Reflection
                                - The properties of matter are transformed when atoms are bonded into compounds or molecules, and different arrangements or system of connections produce very different outcomes or conclusions - e.g. [graphite and diamond](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-can-graphite-and-diam/)
                            - Here is a great example of how [[elaboration]] of biological concepts facilitates understanding which facilitates [[memory]] [*](((2Uq2Xd0uj))) 
                                - Notice that [[elaboration]] is about asking good questions of **how **and **why**, which is what the process of creating permanent notes for the slip-box forces us to do! [*](((eZN77TuFJ)))
                            - [[Ebbinghaus]] stripped the learning process of the very essence of learning: ie. making meaningful connections [*](((KxVXL0_m8))) and laid the foundations for learning theories which separated understanding from learning [*](((Mr009BRZT)))
                                - It's such a cool feeling when you think of a connection and then realise that the author has made the same connection! #Reflection
                                - We only really make connections through a note-taking process which forces us to translate and reframe ideas into our own words. I wonder whether I would have made the same connections simply by reading and highlighting as I normally do. #Reflection

                - Ideally, new notes are written with explicit reference to already existing notes. Obviously, this is not always possible, especially in the beginning when the slip-box is still in its infancy, but it will very soon become the first option most of the time. Then you can put the new note “behind” an existing, related note straight away. Luhmann, working with pen and paper, would put a note behind an existing one and number it accordingly. If the existing note bore the number 21, he numbered the new note 22. If note number 22 already existed, he would still add it behind 21, but number it 21a. By alternating numbers and letters, he was able to branch out into an infinite number of sequences and sub-sequences internally with no hierarchical order. [*](((w0V5_IvQg)))

                - An initial subsequence that attracts more and more follow-up notes can easily become a main topic with many subtopics over time (Schmidt 2013, 172). The digital Zettelkasten makes things easier: numbers are assigned automatically, note sequences can be constructed any time later and one note can become the follow-up note to different notes at the same time. [*](((P-qYCOOKr)))
                    - As different branches obtain varying degrees of critical mass (or length if we want to visualise it), topics and subtopics of interest will naturally emerge
                        - The volume of notes is a way to quantitatively differentiate between our own degrees of interest in pursuing multiple possible paths
                            - Really useful for open-ended paper, research direction, Honours, PhD - and general life interests!
                - These note sequences are the backbone of text development. They combine the advantages of an abstract with a topic-related order. A pure topic-related order would have to be organised top down and requires a hierarchical order up front. A pure abstract order would not allow idea clusters and topics to be built bottom up. The individual notes would stay mostly independent and isolated with only one-dimensional references–pretty much like a one-person Wikipedia stripped of the knowledge and fact-checking abilities of the community. [*](((7hcRk98a3)))
                - But a loose order of sequences allows freedom to change course when necessary and provides enough structure to build up complexity.** Notes are only as valuable as the note and reference networks they are embedded in.** [*](((_Ci5SS4hS)))
                    - Having isolated pieces of knowledge is really useless - but having a theoretical framework for mental models without concrete pieces of knowledge attached is similarly empty and useless. We need pieces of atomic information and to be able to join them together. 
                - Because the slip-box is not intended to be an encyclopedia, but a tool to think with, we don’t need to worry about completeness. We don’t need to write anything down just to bridge a gap in a note sequence. We only write if it helps us with our own thinking. The gaps we do need to concern ourselves with are the gaps in the arguments in the final manuscript–but these gaps will only become obvious in the next step, when we take the relevant notes for an argument out of the network of the slip-box and sort them into the linear order for the rough draft. [*](((iXpbFQLs4)))

                - As the slip-box is not a book with just one topic, we don’t need to have an overview of it. On the contrary, we are much better off accepting as early as possible that an overview of the slip-box is as impossible as having an overview of our own thinking while we are thinking. As an extension of our own memory, the slip-box is the medium we think in, not something we think about. The note sequences are the clusters where order emerges from complexity. We extract information from different linear sources and mix it all up and shake it until new patterns emerge. Then, we form these patterns into new linear texts. [*](((wGGcv4ThN)))

Choose your keywords based on the projects you're working on or want to work on. Think about when you'd want to find the note again. Avoid choosing topic-based keywords or obvious keywords which are already in the note.

                    - **Assign keywords based on topics you're working on or interested in.** You can scan your existing notes for ideas if you're stuck. A good rule of thumb is that a good keyword is probably **not** written in the note itself, or even in your existing list of keywords (**sometimes** it's better to think deeply and see if you can come up with a new keyword rather than fall back on existing options as new keywords can lead you down new trains of thought.) [*](UhUikcAob) 
                - "Let’s assume I want to add a short note that says: “Tversky/ Kahneman (1973) showed in an experiment that people are more likely to overestimate the likelihood of an event to happen if they are able to conceive it well and in detail than if it were abstract.” If you think in terms of archiving, you might feel keywords like “misjudgements,” “experimental psychology” or “experiment” would be fitting. In this case, you would think in general categories like “subject,” “discipline” or “method.” It is rather unlikely that you will ever think of writing an article based on all notes to “experimental psychology” or see the need for retrieving all notes filed under “experiment.” Maybe you will think about a book that collects “misjudgements,” but it is unlikely that you could turn any of these piles of notes into a structured argument."
                - "As writers, we approach the question of keywords differently. We look at our slip-box for already existing lines of thought and think about the questions and problems already on our minds to which a new note might contribute."
                - "If you are an economist working on decision-making, you might think of the preferences management often shows for projects with an easy-to-visualise outcome over more profitable ones. A fitting keyword would then be “capital allocation problems.” By assigning the keyword alone, the note is already put into a specific context, which gives it a particular meaning and triggers context-specific questions like: If this is a systematic effect, can it be measured? Has someone already measured it? Does the effect show up in available data, like the market value of publicly listed companies, and if so, is it that companies with products that are easy to visualise have richer valuations than those who offer services or products that are rather difficult to grasp? And if not: Is it because the experimental findings cannot be extrapolated or is it because the knowledge is already publicly available and therefore priced in? If not, is it another argument against the Efficient Market hypothesis or just a good way to stack the odds in the stock market in your favour?"
                - "By assigning this keyword, you might stumble upon already existing notes on capital allocation, which either help to answer these questions or trigger new ones. But maybe you are a political scientist and read this note as an answer to the question of why certain topics are discussed during an election and others not, or why it could be politically more sensible to promote easy-to-visualise solutions over solutions that really work.

You don’t need to concern yourself with them if you use the digital program. [*](((X6m7mWcFt)))
                - #[[Literature Notes]] The two types of links in a digital [[Zettlekasten]] are index-topic overview-notes and note-note. By using this system, we are not only encouraged to look for meaningful connections, but also to check that the connections are grounded in evidence.
                    - **Link Type 1:** A note which provides an overview of a topic and is linked to the index as an entry point into the topic. Luhmann linked up to 25 notes to his overview notes! You'll know when you need to write one and you can add modified versions without the first version becoming redundant. [*](((UuMRDEmqT)))
                    - **Link Type 2:** These are the links between standard notes. We can conceptualise them like links between acquaintances which might not seem very important most of the time, but can sometimes offer something really useful or meaningful in unexpected times. [*](((p41nlfKWx)))
                        - The way in which Luhmann was able to draw links between seemingly unrelated topics of money, power, love, justice and subsume them under the label of social inventions to facilitate acceptance of communication offers is a good example of the insights that can emerge if we use links consistently and **avoid topic-based links!** (which would just keep each of these topics separate) [*](((r5ZeouWw-)))

                - 2. A similar though less crucial kind of link collection is on those notes that give an overview of a local, physical cluster of the slip-box. This is only necessary if you work with pen and paper like Luhmann. While the first type of note gives an overview of a topic, regardless of where the notes are located within the slip-box, this type of note is a pragmatic way of keeping track of all the different topics discussed on the notes that are physically close together. As Luhmann put notes between notes to internally branch out subtopics and sub-subtopics, original lines of thoughts were often interrupted by hundreds of different notes. This second type of note keeps track of the original lines of thought. Obviously, we don’t need to worry about this if we work with the digital version. [*](((H_UKWhcfa)))
                - 3. Equally less relevant for the digital version are those links that indicate the note to which the current note is a follow-up and those links that indicate the note that follows on the current note. Again, this is only relevant to see which notes follow each other, even if they don’t physically stand behind each other anymore. The digital Zettelkasten automatically adds these kinds of backlinks and presents you the relevant notes in a note sequence. [*](((EmgJB7jjH)))
                - In the digital version of the Zettelkasten, all we need to do is to click on “Links” and add the number of the note we want to refer to.

                - If you use the slip-box for a while, you will inevitably make a sobering discovery: The great new idea you are about to add to the slip-box turns out to be already in there. Even worse, chances are this idea wasn’t even yours, but someone else’s. Having the same thought twice or mistaking another person’s idea with our own is far from unusual. Unfortunately, most people never notice this humbling fact because they have no system that confronts them with already thought thoughts. If we forget about an idea and have it again, our brains get as excited as if we are having it the first time. Therefore, working with the slip-box is disillusioning, but at the same time it increases the chance that we actually move forward in our thinking towards uncharted territory, instead of just feeling like we are moving forward. [*](((dVvdWUOa6)))
                - #[[Literature Notes]] It's important to constantly engage in dialogue with old notes in our Zettlekasten because this will allow us to spot inconsistencies that we might otherwise miss given the crude nature of our memory, areas that need clarification [*](((QjptgqZoG))) and avoid [[cognitive biases]] such as the availability heuristic [*](((UlnGDxXow))) 
            - [[Chapter 12.4 Assemble a Toolbox for Thinking]]
                - Just by working with the slip-box, we retrieve old ideas and facts on an irregular basis and connect them with other bits of information–very much how experts recommend we learn (Bjork 2011, 8; Kornell and Bjork 2008). This is also the idea behind flashcards. But even though flashcards are much more effective than cramming or reviewing information within the context of a textbook, they also have a downside: The information on flashcards is neither elaborated on nor embedded in some form of context. Each flashcard stays isolated instead of being connected with the network of theoretical frames, our experiences or our latticework of mental models. This not only makes it much more difficult to learn, but also difficult to understand the implications and the meaning of information (cf. Birnbaum et al., 2013). A scientific term or concept only becomes meaningful within the context of a theory–otherwise it would just be a word. 
                - The same is true for everyday situations. Our ability to read a situation or to interpret information depends on our broader knowledge and how we make sense of it. Science and everyday life are in this regard not so different; both are intertwined. Scientific work is much more pragmatic and less determined by theory than outsiders would expect (Latour and Woolgar 1979). At the same time, we use scientific knowledge and theories to make sense of our surroundings every day. And some theories or theoretical models are surprisingly versatile, which is why it makes sense to assemble a toolbox of useful mental models (Manktelow and Craik 2004) that could help with our daily challenges and make sense of the things we learn and encounter. [*](((nD7ENZrJ2)))
                - When we delegate the storage of knowledge to the slip-box and at the same time focus on the principles behind an idea while we write, add and connect notes, when we look for patterns and think beyond the most obvious interpretation of a note, when we try to make sense of something, combine different ideas and develop lines of thought, we do exactly that: we build up a “latticework of mental models” instead of just “remembering isolated facts and try and bang ’em back.” [*](((rrSp1EqGy)))
                - #[[Literature Notes]] The Zettlekasten is a digital [[connectome]] project with a key difference to the physical version: in the Zettlekasten, we are interested in the quality not quantity of connections, and any current version reflects our current topics and interests.

                    - Co-evolving with our Zettelkasten, building the same connections in our heads while we deliberately develop them in our Zettlekasten - this reminds me of the [[connectome]] idea I was trying to articulate earlier today
                        - Although the physical human [[connectome]] project is nowhere near completion (do we even have the technology to complete it?), we can build a digital [[connectome]] - this is what [[second brain]] projects attempt to do.
                            - One day, we might be able to have a map of all of the physical neural connections in our brain, perhaps even download it, access it and consult it at any time. But we're still a long way off from that goal, so in the meantime, we need some intermediate-level alternative. We can't be aware of every conscious and unconscious connection, and it's impractical to try and map them all (then we would just be racking our brains all day for more connections) - but that's not the point of Zettlekasten either. It's not to record every fleeting connection, but rather, the most pertinent ones, the ones which are front of mind, which we think will help us with what we are working on or which align with our current interests. That's the kind of connection we need to record (rather than drowning in connections, in the same way that we can drown in ideas)

And you’ve got to array your experience, both vicarious and direct, on this latticework of models. You may have noticed students who just try to remember and pound back what is remembered.

But I guess this point about scanning is not really contradictory, because you could still be focused on the one task (ie. have a narrow set of [[mental models]] in your head that you're working with ). I guess the difference with multitasking is you're actually working with very different and completely unrelated [[mental models]] - which is why as mentioned in the [[Sam Harris]] podcast #226 with [[Adam Gazzaley]], they talk about actually seeing different parts of the brain light up as people switch between tasks. 
                            - #Process It's very curious, what's just occurred. I started here with just a literature note because I found something in the paragraph interesting and I just wanted to summarise it as a potentially useful piece of neuroscience knowledge for later on. I was tempted to just stop there, but instead, I had a nagging feeling that there were some unresolved connections waiting to be articulated beneath the surface, so I forced myself to think a little deeper about WHY that section spoke to me, and WHAT CONNECTIONS to my previous knowledge piqued my interest. I guess that's the thing, we only ever find things interesting if we subconsciously detect SOME KIND OF CONNECTION to the pre-existing ideas in our mind which are the basis of any form of interest. And when I did so, I found that although the vague connection I had in mind was logically flawed (see fleeting note above), it led me to uncover some deeper insights on the basis of those flaws! So this note-taking process is really about forcing yourself to identify those vague connections and condense and crystallise them to use Beau's metaphor of the states of matter. Because only by doing so can you start extending your [[latticework]] of [[mental models]] and incorporate the new piece of knowledge into your network in a meaningful and hence useful way, instead of just collecting [[atomic]] pieces of information.
                - Many exciting stories from scientific history make us believe that great insight comes in a flash. There is the sudden insight of Watson and Crick that DNA would have to have the form of a double helix or the story of Friedrich August Kekulé, who allegedly dreamed of a snake biting its own tail and suddenly saw the structure of benzene in front of his eyes. [*](((tsuFTnm5G)))
                - But the reason why Watson and Crick or Kekulé had these insights and not a random person on the street is that they already had spent a very long time thinking hard about the problems, tinkered with other possible solutions and tried countless other ways of looking at the problem. Our fascination with these stories clouds the fact that all good ideas need time. Even sudden breakthroughs are usually preceded by a long, intense process of preparation. [*](((8OsaRd7c8)))
                - Being experienced with a problem and intimately familiar with the tools and devices we work with, ideally to the point of virtuosity, is the precondition for discovering their inherent possibilities, writes Ludwik Fleck, a historian of science (Fleck 2012, 126). This is true even for purely theoretical work. Here, too, we need experience until we can “feel our way” around the problems and questions we deal with, even if these things are words, concepts and notes in a file system. What we learn in practice is always much more thorough and complex than what we could put into words. That is why even purely theoretical work cannot be reduced to explicit knowledge, which is consciously available. This is especially true for the use of a slip-box. It is the intuition that comes from the intimate knowledge of a practice that can lead us to new insights. We might not be able to explicitly state why it is more promising to follow one idea instead of another, but being experienced, we somehow know–which is enough. Experimental scientists regularly describe their decision-making process as being based on intuition (Rheinberger 1997), and there is no reason why it should be different in the social sciences. Maybe it is just harder to accept in the social sciences as we try so hard to be more like natural scientists, who seem to do without something as vague as intuition. But intuition is not the opposition to rationality and knowledge, it is rather the incorporated, practical side of our intellectual endeavours, the sedimented experience on which we build our conscious, explicit knowledge (cf. Ahrens 2014). [*](((efk5QQcC7)))
                - Steven Johnson, who wrote an insightful book about how people in science and in general come up with genuine new ideas, calls it the “slow hunch.” As a precondition to make use of this intuition, he emphasises the importance of experimental spaces where ideas can freely mingle (Johnson 2011). A laboratory with open-minded colleagues can be such a space, much as intellectuals and artists freely discussed ideas in the cafés of old Paris. I would add the slip-box as such a space in which ideas can mingle freely, so they can give birth to new ones. [*](((m6DITkv3w)))

[*](((0mu37NLAS))) It's about setting up a [[working environment]] that is conducive to [[creativity]]. [*](((D1uy190lK)))
                        - #[[Literature Notes]] Another powerful aspect of the [[Zettelkasten]] is that it forces our brains to break out of habits of superficial thinking and automatic interpretation by forming better new habits: forcing ourselves to constantly revise our initial interpretation, using [[counterfactual]] "What if?" questions to see what's missing (cf. [[survivorship bias]]), and focusing on gist by restricting the physical space of our notes (although we will have to find other ways of implementing this last point in a digital system). [*](((zD_LxkuL0)))
                            - Limit yourself to one idea per note, and on a screen, nothing so long that it would involve scrolling! [*](((7p9-c0Nxy)))
                        - #[[Literature Notes]] Remember how bottom-up and top-down processing happens the same time in [[perception]], and how this can lead to [[interpretations]] which miss alternative views? Our brains do the same with leaping to interpretations when we read, such that we think we understand when perhaps we don't get the whole picture. [*](((8z3hrjqSK)))
                        - #Process I didn't really feel the need to write a Zettel for this section because I don't think I had anything new to say. They are just some ideas I'd like to remember and perhaps refer back to later. Is that a distinction between when to create a Zettel and when to leave things at a Literature Note or even Fleeting Note stage? Perhaps that's an idea to come back to at the end of the book, when I try and synthesise everything. 
                            - If I had to come up with something, the summary of this subchapter would be Zettelkasten encourages creativity because proper use of the system requires the breaking of bad thinking habits and the creation of better ones. Maybe that can be my Zettel statement.
                - Comparing, differentiating and connecting notes are the basis of good academic writing, but playing and tinkering with ideas is what leads to insight and exceptional texts. [*](((8p-Wx0Zuh)))
                - The real enemy of independent thinking is not an external authority, but our own inertia. The ability to generate new ideas has more to do with breaking with old habits of thinking than with coming up with as many ideas as possible. For obvious reasons, I do not recommend “thinking outside the box”. On the contrary, we can turn the slip-box into a tool for breaking out of our own thinking habits. [*](((szZVctiOS)))
                - Our brains just love routines. Before new information prompts our brains to think differently about something, they make the new information fit into the known or let it disappear completely from our perception. Usually, we don’t even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to make it fit its expectations. We need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinking routines. In their book with the showy title “The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking”, the mathematicians Edward B. Burger and Michael Starbird collected different strategies to do that (2012). Some are already technically implemented in the slip-box, others are good to keep in mind. [*](((6JKyVrlqX)))
                - For example, they emphasise the importance of feedback loops and the need to find ways to confront ourselves with our errors, mistakes and misunderstandings. This is a built-in feature of the slip-box. Another habit of the effective thinkers they highlight is their ability to focus on the main ideas behind the details, to grasp the gist of something. This, too, is something the slip-box nudges us to do. [*](((cRq2EDGw_)))
            - [[Chapter 12.7 Facilitate Creativity through Restrictions]]
                - The slip-box imposes quite a few restrictions on its user. Instead of having the choice between all kinds of fancy notebooks, papers or writing formats, or being able to employ the whole range of productivity tools available for note-taking, learning and academic or nonfiction writing, everything is reduced to a single plain-text format and collected in a single simple slip-box system with no frills or features. Even the computer program basically just emulates a wooden box filled with plain, consecutively numbered paper. And even though the digital program lifts the physical restrictions on the length of a note, I highly recommend treating a digital note as if the space were limited. By restricting ourselves to one format, we also restrict ourselves to just one idea per note and force ourselves to be as precise and brief as possible. The restriction to one idea per note is also the precondition to recombine them freely later. Luhmann choose notes in the format A6. A good rule of thumb for working with the program is: Each note should fit onto the screen and there should be no need of scrolling.

In language, art, music, computing, a set of restrictions can be combined or played with in infinite ways to create infinite possibilities.]] [*](((cEY7Tb21M)))
                        - #[[Literature Notes]] Less choice is better in academic writing in terms of saving energy for more important decisions, as in most aspects of life. [*](((AT3B9tugn)))
                - Standardised is also the way we treat literature and our own thoughts: Instead of using different kinds of notes or techniques for different kinds of texts or ideas, the approach here is always the same, simple one. Literature is condensed on a note saying, “On page x, it says y,” and later stored with the reference in one place. Ideas and thoughts are captured on the slip-box notes and connected to other notes always in the same way in the same place. These standardizations make it possible that the technical side of note-taking can become automatic. Not having to think about the organisation is really good news for brains like ours–the few mental resources we have available, we need for thinking about the actual relevant questions: those concerning the contents.

    - Instructions for using rand [[plugins/(rand)]]
    - [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
        - [[Goals for Book Club]]
            - Understand the Zettelkasten principles such that I am able to articulate them succintly
            - Implement Zettelkasten in my own Roam, remembering that it doesn't need to be perfect the first time around and that as I learn and experiment, the system will evolve
            - Develop and start following a routine for daily reading, notetaking, thinking and writing
            - Build lasting connections with and learn from fellow book club member 
    - [[Writing Prompts]]
        - "Write about the best book you have ever read, and what made it great. What does this book need to do, to be similar?"
            - Atomic Habits was pretty awesome because it was about a topic (habit formation) that has the potential to make a huge impact to the quality of many people's lives, and presented many simple actionable steps for change in a succinct and well-structured way. I hope this book will introduce Zettlekasten to us in a similar fashion.
    - [[Book Prompts]]
        - "“A good structure enables flow, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). Something like that does not happen by chance.” [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]] [*]([[Beau Haan 📌]])"
            - Yes, structure or routine reduces the friction of thinking - it's like one less thing (or multiple less things!) for your brain to think about (how am I going to organise this, how will I find the information later, how does it match my previous systems...)
        - "“The ability to express understanding in one’s own words is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes – and only by doing it with the chance of realizing our lack of understanding can we become better at it. But the better we become, the easier and quicker we can make notes, which again increases the number of learning experiences. The same applies to the crucial ability to distinguish the important bits of a text from the less important ones: the better we become at it, the more effective our reading will become, the more we can read, the more we will learn. We will enter a beautiful, virtuous circle of competency. You cannot help but feel motivated by it.” [[Chapter 8. Let the Work Carry You Forward]] [*]([[Beau Haan 📌]])"
            - Yes, like any other skill, it's all about practice. This also reminds me of the Feynman test of understanding: can you teach it to a 5-year-old? Being able to express understanding in one's own words is essentially the capacity to teach, and teaching is one of the best ways fo consolidating knowledge.
    - [[November 30th, 2020]]
        - Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month. 
        - Reflect on your Zettel process
        - Why do you want a Zettelkasten?
    - [[Book Club Live Session 6]]
        - You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say? 
            - Zettelkasten is a method of note-taking that facilitates deeper understanding and generation of new ideas by guiding you to abstract ideas to their essence on the one hand, and to elaborate connections to other ideas on the other.
        - Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?
            - Yes, I have been reading with more purpose and my note-taking has become more structured. I've also started implementing SRS as part of my note-taking. I have yet to try writing using my notes but my goal is to start a mind garden and publish at least one public note by the end of the year.
        - The book promotes a bottom-up approach to note-taking, which we have used in Book Club. Reflect on this. How did this feel? 
            - It doesn't feel that different to what I've done before. Isn't all note-taking bottom up? I think what is different is constantly thinking about and trying to articulate answers to questions like "why does this resonate with me?" and "what else does this remind me of?"
