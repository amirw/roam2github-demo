        - Endergonic reactions drive themselves. This is akin to a workflow that pulls us along, energizing us.
        - Our work, when self sustaining, adds energy and keeps propelling us forward.
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] In order to change habits, we need mechanisms that self sustain. This can create greater energy (think chemical reactions). The result is new possibilities.
        - Different ways to remember
            - Active work
            - Self-sustaining
        - Effort is to move towards self-sustaining
            - Something that which that doesn't need to be constantly remembered
            - Something that operates on it's own
                - It has a reason
                - You don't have to restart it everyday
        - Changing habits
            - The way of thinking
            - What I read
            - The way I process
            - Seeing it through a different lens altogether
        - Moving towards an auto-mode
            - Helps building habits
            - Incentivized
            - Using that to grow knowledge
        - Lots of chemistry
            - Chemical reactions
            - Innocent liquid liquids and then it goes BOOM!!!
                - I can't do that by adding power, it's the liquids coming together
                    - Not independently
        - Feeling more and more energy
            - The two test tubes, the chemical reaction when the two mix
                - That creates something you could never imagine
                - Excitement from the color
                    - The new world
        - Driving you faster in a different way
            - Somewhat linked to the energy, but it's the new possibilities
            - Showing a world you never knew existed
