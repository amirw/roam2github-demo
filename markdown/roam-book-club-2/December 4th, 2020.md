- ### >#[[Daily Writing Prompt]] "What has been helpful in [[Roam Book Club 2]]? "
    1. [[Chinarut]] this pretty much marks the first book I‚Äôve ever systematically turned into my own words beyond just a book review on Goodreads.
        - I honestly don‚Äôt recall my book reports in grade school ever being as powerful or as much fun at this process. A lot of it has to do with:
            - collectively learning Zettelkasten together [[public learning]]
            - having such a huge support structure including using Roam to handle on the details of fleeting to literature to permanent notes
            - being coached to not just regurgitate the book, but follow your interests!
        - Soren is very true to his word, Zetteling is a really amazing process if you stay present to the dialogue in your slipbox and stay open to letting your slipbox shift your thinking.
        - When you allow for the unexpected and you let go of any preconceived notion of what happens by the end - it does feel very rewarding indeed
        - Well...our journey ain‚Äôt over yet! üòÅ
    2. [[Ronaldo Batista]] Like [[@[[Chinarut]]]], for me too this is the first book I sistematically turned into my own distilled notes, i.e. literature notes as thought in the book. For most books very interesting books I pretty much only save passages to never look at it again or stop poorly annotating after a few chapters.
        -  I am still considerably slower, I have but one Zettel but I can already feel at least the information pretty much solidified from the book. The challenge is to turn it to knowledge.
        -  I still am trying to find the best format that works for me, reducing friction in the process. I think [[@Beau Haan]] 3 steps process and phases analogy makes it the most sense.
        - The thing which clicked for me and it's going to last is the idea of writing as a mean and an end, the conversation partner and the purge of the blank page problem. This seems like a turning point and I'll be rewarded if I just put the hours like everything that matters.

- #Chat [[Chinarut]] lol - I thought I‚Äôd savor the moment and work on my last zettel for the book tomorrow and was clear I had built up so much momentum I couldn‚Äôt resist! As I was crafting this zettel, I was really moved emotionally as it was clear in my last 2 or 3 zettels I was synthesizing my transformational education that started here in [[San Francisco]] in 2001 with Zettlekasten in 2020, which is also a year about our world learning to rewrite the future in the face of current events!
    - "#Zettels [[We transform how we teach wellbeing by giving up the fallacy of a top-down approach to life and coach students to build a lifelong structure for transformation and use declaration as a means to synthesize diverse experiences in life. When students have access to experiences beyond themselves, wellbeing becomes life itself]] z46"
- #Chat [[Chinarut]] I want to stress it‚Äôs not about ‚Äúthe most‚Äù zettels or time spent - that said, I do want to put data out there to help anyone else set expectations: it took me about 15 hours to turn all my `Literature Notes` into `Zettels` plus maybe 11 additional hrs of ‚Äúsupporting‚Äù tasks (total of ~26 hrs) over the past 9 days
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] Love, love, love this!!! 
    - I still have my goal for book club which is to shape a statement of purpose from my zettels by Sunday so this will be the true proof in the pudding :)
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] You got this, my man! Crush it~
