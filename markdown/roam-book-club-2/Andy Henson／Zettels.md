It will get to a point where no-one else can get close to your output.
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A zettelkasten should create an abundance of ideas and insights densely connected
        - This idea of verbund is really interesting to me and it's how I see Roam helping to connect these processes together more easily and visually
        - Roam's block level thinking causes us to think more in terms of the slip box limitations. One card = 1 thought or idea = 1 block
- #[[Zettels]] [[Without awareness, homeostasis will prevent you from building consistent habits that lead to transformation]]
    - #[[Reference Notes]] [Chapter 14. (Paragraph 6))](((4hIM0I_l_)))
    - #[[Literature Notes]] By building a consistent habit of reading with pen and paper in hand and noting what's interesting and important you stand a chance of replacing your old note-taking habits. When this new habit is installed, you'll more easily develop and make new connections. Done consistently, it will be transformative.
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Breaking old habits and forming new ones is hard, but when you have mastered it, it can be transformative.
        - Consistency breeds transformation
        - The promise of replacing old habits with better new ones
        - establishing a daily routine to think better
        - When I've stayed with a positive routine, it's been transformative
            - I've built myself an identity of someone who keeps fit with kettlebells
            - I've built a meditation habit, and working on good journaling habits
                - all these have improved my life measurably
                - I see the promise in this habit of writing too
        - breaking habits is hard
            - environments and others cause systems to tend back towards what George Leonard in __Mastery__ calls homeostasis - a resistance to change
        - Homeostasis is the natural process where we fall to the level of our systems - Sonke's saying that we should instead try to build this new habit to excise the previous habits, doing it consistently until it's easy is key, consistency is key to making it easier to generate new connections and insights
- #Zettels [[A Zettelkasten generates creativity within the constraints of its structure by forcing us to make choices about what is worthy of pursuit without impeding flow]]
    - #[[Reference Notes]] [12.7 Facilitate Creativity through Restrictions](((cEY7Tb21M)))
        - The biggest threat to creativity and scientific progress is therefore the opposite: a lack of structure and restrictions. Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas. **Without restrictions, we would never be forced to make the decision on what is worth pursuing and what is not. Indifference is the worst environment for insight**. And the slip-box is, above all, **a tool for enforcing distinctions, decisions and making differences visible**. One thing is for sure: the common idea that we should liberate ourselves from any restrictions and “open ourselves up” to be more creative is very misleading indeed (Dean 2013, 201).
    - #[[Literature Notes]] Restrictions enable creativity by forcing us to make a decision as to what's worth pursuing or not. We need some structure and constraints in order to do this effectively, but not so much to impede our flow.
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] 
        - Creativity is found in constraints
            - this is a dichotomy
            - given unlimited time and budget isn't likely to lead to progress - just messing around
            - there's a tension between having a goal, and goal-less exploration. Bounded exploration, and then a clear north star
        - The zettelkasten provides enough structure and a goal to enable creativity but not enough to impede the flow
        - Also reminds me that technology is also a factor in preventing creativity - we make it so easy to capture that most of what's captured is meaningless - and the volume prevents true understanding and taking action
            - overwhelm with sheer amount
            - with zettelkasten there's been a lot of assumptions I've made about what it is and isn't

    - #[[Reference Notes]] [11.1 Make a career one note at at a time](((b26SBAbEZ)))
        - "And likewise, the sum of the slip-box content is worth much more than the sum of the notes. More notes mean more possible connections, more ideas, more synergy between different projects and therefore a much higher degree of productivity. Luhmann’s slip-box contains about 90,000 notes, which sounds like an incredibly large number. But it only means that he wrote six notes a day from the day he started to work with his slip-box until he died."
        - "If you, by any chance, don’t have the ambition to compete with him in terms of books per year, you could settle for three notes a day and still build up a significant critical mass of ideas in a very reasonable time. And you could settle for less than one book every twelve months. In contrast to manuscript pages per day, a certain number of notes a day is a reasonable goal for academic writing. And that is because taking a note and sorting it into the slip-box can be done in one go, while writing a manuscript page could involve weeks and months of preparation involving other tasks as well. You could therefore measure your daily productivity by the number of notes written."
    - #[[Literature Notes]] A modest goal of permanent notes created per day is an effective way to measure your daily productivity and feels achievable
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Building a habit of creating permanent notes every day is a good leading indicator of your productivity
        - Status:: #PROCESSED
        - this feels much more achievable
            - I remember having this simple aim with meditation - just do 10 minutes a day
                - it compounds with practice and consistency
        - this is a leading indicator - habit based outcomes lead to an identity change - as in [[Atomic Habits]]
        - it's not wasted time if it becomes useful, as mentioned earlier the notes compound interest - they're greater than the sum of their parts
        - building a habit like this facilitates thinking - it's deliberate practice for thinking
            - a valuable byproduct
- #Zettels [[The slipbox is the antidote to writers block]]
    - #[[Reference Notes]] [13.4 Finishing and Review](((2WQrQNiI-)))
    - #[[Literature Notes]] The slipbox gives you a defensive strategy against the force of resistance. When you encounter it, channel it toward another productive outcome.
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This seems to be the antidote to [[Steven Pressfield]]'s Resistance.
        - Don't fight the resistance; redirect it
        - There's an element here that this idea of verbund that the slipbox facilitates helps to fight the Resistance
        - Again the power of metaphor shapes how we view things - and popular culture informs this - the sharing of quotes and ideas without fully understanding is both good and bad. The idea popularised by [[Steven Pressfield]] suggests there's a fight and a struggle - which there is often is. That's the hard work that we have to push through. I like this martial arts metaphor where it's almost a defensive strategy. This idea is more powerful to me, to go with the flow
            - There is a counter-claim though - does this make it more difficult to complete work? Or work when there is a deadline? At any sign of discomfort are we redirecting? When do we have to stand and fight?
        - self-defense over attacking
        - My chat with [[Beau Haan]] helped crystallise this, our [[Zettelkasten]] is how we have the dialogue with ourselves, how we redirect the resistance to finishing a note because we're not ready yet. A zettel is just a thought we have pulled into a solid; it can be reformed further but it's a building block we created at this moment in time, we can use it to have an authentic conversation with ourselves - the act of placing it within the zettel structure is just picking up the informal conversations we're having, we can link it to other tangents in our related or connected notes to create new conversations later
- #Zettels [[An organised but simple system for writing notes of any type means that we never have to stare at a blank page again]]
    - #[[Reference Notes]] [Introduction](((NOUeE9wbB)))
    -  Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.
    - And maybe that is the reason why we rarely think about this writing, the everyday writing, the note-taking and draft-making. Like breathing, it is vital to what we do, but because we do it constantly, it escapes our attention. But while even the best breathing technique would probably not make much of a difference to our writing, any improvement in the way we organise the everyday writing, how we take notes of what we encounter and what we do with them, will make all the difference for the moment we do face the blank page/ screen–or rather not, as those who take smart notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again.
    - #[[Literature Notes]] 
        - Writing is the medium in which we render all the research, learning, studying as well as the final results. The promise of organising all this writing well means we never have to stare at a blank page again when we come to write.
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] 
        - "Good note-taking is to writing as meditation is to breathing. It’s automatic so we don’t tend to pay attention to it [*](((NOUeE9wbB)))"
            - This is something to aspire to - capturing the essence and imbuing it with my own experiences and thoughts
            - The lack of the blank page problem is appealing too
        - I was never taught how to take notes well, plus at school I seemed to remember enough and thus I never had to really study that hard to get good grades. I feel like I'm paying for that now as I get older and the things I'm learning and doing are now less "hands-on" so it's a more cerebral learning process at which I'm not well-practiced in the thinking to internalise it. This is why the zettelkasten approach really appeals to me. Certainly all my note-taking in years past hasn't had a significant impact.
- #Zettels [[Insight can be manufactured more efficiently via a daily work habit and a simple system of organisation]]
    - #[[Reference Notes]] [1.2 The Slip-box](((lMo5zp36O)))
        - The contemporaries of Henry Ford did not understand why something as simple as the conveyor belt should be that revolutionary. What difference does it make to let the cars move from worker to worker instead of letting the workers walk from car to car? I would not be surprised if some of them even thought of Ford as a bit simpleminded and overly enthusiastic about a rather minor change in work organization. It is only in hindsight that the scale of the advantages of this small tweak became obvious to everyone. I wonder how long it will take until the advantages of Luhmann’s slip-box and work routines become equally obvious to everyone. But by then, everyone will already have known it all along the way. [*](((lMo5zp36O)))
    - #[[Literature Notes]] The organisation of work and process can bring enormous production benefits from even minor-seeming changes. It enables greater efficiency and flow.
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] 
        - It occurs to me that [[Beau Haan]]'s system for more quickly squishing fleeting->permanent notes together is an extension of this - another manufacturing term one-piece flow
        - If you've gone to the expense of loading the thing into your brain with an immediate insight, why not take it through to its logical conclusion in one swoop? Why come back to it several times?
            - I guess there's an argument against this for the spaced repetition concepts
        - It's similar to the kanban style of limiting your work-in-progress and getting to completion - the permanent note more quickly, less open loops
        - The key is daily flow
            - balancing the "easy" work of exploration and fleeting notes against the hard work of abstracting and summarising over and over. this one-piece flow idea helps to build the muscle of new habits with something to show for it, and begin to make connections sooner
        - There's a lot of metaphor here for the writing process and modern manufacturing techniques of lean and waste - zettelkasten hits them all. Nothing is wasted and they are reused like verbundance.
            - keeping the production lines running 24/7
- #Zettels [[Simple, trusted systems which augment and compensate for our brains limitations are desirable over those which seek to automate our thinking]]
    - #[[Reference Notes]] [1.3 The slip-box manual](((kVuIQFmCg)))
        - Now that you know how the slip-box works, you only need to understand how to work with it. And the best way to understand this is to understand a little bit about the way we think, learn and develop ideas. And if I were forced to boil it down to a single bullet point, it would be this: **We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains**. But first, let me guide you through the process of writing a paper with the slip-box.
    - #[[Literature Notes]] The slip-box is a simple, yet reliable trusted system that works in tandem with the way we think and learn, and which compensates and augments the natural limitations of our brains
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] We need systems to augment not automate our own brains, the concepts like building a second brain are what we desire.
        - There are many names we give this concept:
            - second brain
            - external brain
            - memex
            - maybe even a commonplace or hodgepodge book
            - zettelkasten
        - A way to make our thoughts external and more tangible
        - We are visual creatures, when we can see our thoughts we're more able to manipulate and meld them into something more coherent, and make real.
        - Tools like Roam that work more like, and with, our brains promise bigger break-throughs than even [[Niklas Luhmann]] demonstrated with the analogue slip-box
- #Zettels [[Collecting information does not generate insight. To develop new ideas you must build bridges between your existing clusters of knowledge.]]
    - #[[Reference Notes]] [2.1 Writing a paper step-by-step](((y5dDNqTm7)))
        - 3. Make permanent notes. Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two **(ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant)** and **think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box–**^^**it only contains what interests you anyway**^^. **The idea is **^^**not to collect**^^**, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. **Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them? 
    - #[[Literature Notes]] The process of making permanent notes takes the information you've abstracted and summarised in your fleeting and literature notes and then looking through your slip-box to think about how they relate to what you have already made plain.
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] "Don't fall into the [[Collectors Fallacy]]", connect it to what you already know
        - I've collected things because they sound interesting, or I think they might be useful later in *some* way. I have often not taken the time to think more deeply and see if it adds to something I already know, or if it generates a new insight
        - Use the existing slipbox notes to figure out how to fit this new information to what you already know

        - The lesson to draw is to ^^**be generally sceptical about planning, especially if it is merely focused on the outcome**^^, **not on the actual work and the steps required to achieve a goal**. While it doesn’t help to imagine oneself the great author of a successful and timely finished paper, it does make a difference if we have a realistic idea about what needs to be done to get there in our minds. We know from sports that it doesn’t help when athletes imagine themselves as winners of a race, but it makes a big difference if they imagine all the training that is necessary to be able to win. **Having a more realistic idea in mind not only helps them to perform better, it also boosts their motivation** (Singer et al. 2001). We know today that this is not only true for athletes, but for any work that needs effort and endurance (Pham and Taylor 1999). Writing definitely belongs in this category.
    - #[[Literature Notes]] 
        - For any work which requires ongoing effort having a systematic understanding of the actual steps involved, not just the outcome in mind, results in better performance and motivation.
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Many similarities to agile software development and estimating
        - As the owner of a software development team, it really reminds me of the agile methods vs waterfall planning and the difficulties of estimation. There's a lot of parallels between writing projects based on research and doing software development.
        - Sprints are timeboxed, and you can think of the zettelkasten flow as a similar sort of thing. There's a lightweight flow to agile methods of taking the highest priority items, and then breaking them down into smaller blocks and estimating those
        - Becoming better at estimating is part of having short feedback loops and reflecting on your sessions, and doing retrospectives
        - As with writing it's hard to know exactly how long something will take to develop, which makes planning difficult and inaccurate
            - In software development, if developers are not great at breaking the problem down into steps that they know how to do then estimates are generally poor, which means deadlines will be missed and clients unhappy. This is why using story points as effort can help to correctly size something in the first place
        - "Emphasis should be on purposeful, actionable, continuous and trackable progress" - from [[Anne-Laure Le Cunff]]
        - Getting better at estimating

        - Becoming better at estimating is part of having short feedback loops and reflecting on your sessions, and doing retrospectives
        - Be sceptical of planning when you're only focused on outcomes and not the actual work involved in getting there. 
            - if planning is only focused on outcomes it's likely to be poor because you haven't thought about the actual work involved and the steps needed
            - The key points is looking at the actual process of doing the work, not imagining the end results when planning. When you achieve your targets, it's more motivating than realising you're always behind or you didn't get as much done as you'd hoped
        - This is also similar to activity based selling - instead of aiming at numbers outside of your control, concentrate on doing x calls per day - you'll soon know on average how many it takes to close a sale. Then it's just a math problem over the longer term.
        - Made of composable pieces that are broadly similar, then it's a matter of reassembling in various ways - that's the path to becoming an expert - it's why learning design patterns, etc is useful. You learn the pattern and how long it roughly takes - then you know when you would apply that pattern to solve specific problems and thus can estimate more accurately
