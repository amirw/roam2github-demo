    - How far have people read?
        - It seemed like most were around 50%
    - Kaitlyn Dennis
        - Found the idea of "hermeneutic circle" rather than being linear useful
    - Myles Orme
        - Already saw fiction writing as being circular
        - Wondering how to build up the slip-box
    - Joshua Butler
        - Found the section about typical advice for "how to write" accurate
        - "Gardening your ideas" rather than pulling them into place
        - Trying it currently - "speeding up the gardening"
        - Perhaps a mix of letting it go more naturally and then speedrunning parts.
    - Gleb Reys
        - Likes the idea of bracketing topics
        - But then how do you know if a bracket/topic is actually a hollow topic
        - Finding Daily Notes in Roam is helpful in that practice of "cultivating" the garden
    - Do you take notes in Roam or elsewhere?
        - Some people live in Roam exclusively
        - Others do it in a notebook and then transfer it
    - Gleb Reys
        - Maybe add tags at the beginning of every note
        - Maybe have a color code or tag for fleeting notes to quickly 
    - Myles Orme
        - CSS Themes that can change the tags, labels, color codes
        - Maggie Appleton Leyendecker Theme

    - Gleb Reys
        - Using Kindle and finding he's highlighting perhaps too much rather than taking fleeting notes
    - Myles Orme
        - Finding it it confusing to take fleeting notes while reading
    - Gleb Reys 
        - Going back through past notes he's noticing that they have lost much of their meaning and context now. Even the the *Urgent* notes.
    - **A couple of themes that floated to the top**
        - "Gardening" ideas rather than planning out
            - Finding the rolling Daily Notes as a natural place for the "cultivation" to play out
        - People had difficulty applying fleeting notes to reading the text
