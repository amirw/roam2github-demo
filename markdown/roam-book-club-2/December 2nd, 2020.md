    - #Reply-from [[Matt McKinlay]] 
        - Nice Mike. I like the distinction and I agree when reflecting on how my own zettelkasten process has changed. I think my zettelkasten process is becoming increasing high fidelity thanks to working it through everyone's ideas and effort in this bookclub 
        - Although I also think of the [[exploration/exploitation tradeoff]] when thinking about this diagram. Choosing between discreet known options is a different scenario to [[exploration]] work, searching in an [[unmapped landscape]]. 
            - I think experts with rich knowledge structures often are staying comfortably within known techniques, methods, [[mature knowledge domains]] where all the exploration work has long gone.  
                - And sometimes when that knowledge is put to the test, it can crack quickly. 
                    - Actually reminds me of the example in the book- 
                        - ((rQR4JiJRA))
                            - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]] Yes! I, too, was reminded of that CPR example when I saw the diagram. The diagram conflates experts and instructors while the CPR example distinguished teachers from practitioners. The former "know that . . .", the latter "know how . . ."
                                - #Reply-from [[Matt McKinlay]] Yes that's great Mike. Sonke's book seems to offer/emphasize an inductive approach to creating rich meaningful knowledge structures. Feels too that's what we are doing here, building 'know how' of Zetteling together
                                - 
                - I do like the idea of a rich knowledge structure specifically for exploration. I think exploration can be viewed as a technique. But it might in some way have to start with sparse knowledge to begin.
                    - Also reminded of the example of shipping containers in Chapter 6, where sticking to known norms of knowledge led to missing the key insights [[Malcolm Mclean]] '[tipped the world in a new direction](((0nwoZGXB8)))' with standard shipping container size. 
                        - Experts knew of the idea, but hadn't pursued it for logical reasons
                            - ((Dm-3dFWDJ))
                                - ((tGpZ2B0iQ))
                                - ((ICpYBBfir))
                                - ((He8jiishw))
                                - ((gDwj56vKa))
                                - Walmart now has containers shipped from China completely full intended for a specific store in the US.

1) [[Benjamin Klammer]] just made his first `Zettel` in the shared graph! Bravo!
2) Connection > Collection, quoted directly from [[Doc Ayomide]] as he not only created a `Zettel` but continued the conversation!
3) [[Joey Harris]] making it look so easy, when he's working at note-taking from the bottom-up!
    1. "#Zettels [[Once you put into the effort of work for Zettelkasten-Workflow and stick with it, you will recieve more energy than it costs you.]]"
        - "#[[Reference Notes]] [Chapter 8 - Let the word carry you forward. Paragraph 1](((RK0T2uHBh)))"
        - "#[[Literature Notes]] Working with a Zettelkasten starts as an exergonic reaction, but continues as an endergonic reaction after you get in the workflow."
            - "Once you get in the workflow fo a Zettelkasten, it will energize you more than it takes energy from you. It starts with an exergonic reaction but after a certain point it changes to endergonic reaction."
        - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] If the Zettelkasten should give you energy in the future, you have to have the guts to work with it everyday."
            - "Energy is a limited amount of source we all have through the day. Roy Baumeister calls this the Ego Deplation. You have to make a lot decisions through the entire day which sort robs you energy and reduces you're ability to regulate/have Voltion/Willpower. "
            - "Stick to the process and try to trust in yourself."
            - "There seems to be a sort of cumulation point where your Zettelkasten doesn't rob you energy anymore. Instead of that it's the complete opposite. It gives you energy and power. You really have to trust the process and keep on trying, than you will get to that point. "
    2. "#Zettels [[Simplicity in our process and thought enables the complexity we want in our work.]]"
        - "#[[Reference Notes]] [Chapter 1.1, paragraph 3](((1NJY4CSAC)))"
        - "#[[Literature Notes]] Simplicity is the parent of complexity, not its antithesis. "
            - "The existence of complexity is precisely why simplicity is necessary: by keeping things simple, we are able to not only navigate complexity more confidently, but can also go on to create even more sustainable complex structures, while maintaining a clear understanding of both what we built and the process by which we built it."
        - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] Simplicity is what makes complexity possible, but this is counterintuitive, and leads us to unnecessarily complicate things."
            - "The simpler we start, the more complex structures we can build "
                - "think fractals"
                - "the mistake we often make is to imagine that complexity requires complication "
                - "we want complexity at the end, not the beginning‚Äîin the outcome/product, not the process"
                - "this is the deceptiveness of simplicity: and why it is not easy‚Äîwhy people on the outside looking in don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs ‚Äúreally that simple‚Äù"
    3. "#[[Zettels]] [[Work becomes play as concentrated expertise is freely expressed.]]"
        - "#[[Reference Notes]] [Chapter 8, paragraph 1](((RK0T2uHBh)))"
        - "#[[Literature Notes]] The best work feels like play."
            - "Some reactions require energy and other reactions produce energy. Work processes are the same. A state of flow is achieved when one releases and expresses one's concentrated expertise. This is liberating rather than constraining. Rather than feeling like effortful labour, working in flow feels more like play."
        - "#[[Fleeting Notes]]True flow comes from a triggered release of energy; the free expression of one's concentrated expertise."
            - "Explosions"
                - "Are release of energy, expression of freedom"
                    - "Being free from a more constrained state"
