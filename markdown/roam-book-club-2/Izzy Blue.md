- [[Questions for SÃ¶nke]]
    - How his system evolves and changes, especially since writing the book, and how  those changes handle notes from previous approaches?
    - When going from an analog system to a digital one, or from one digital system to another, what approach do you take to bringing in old notes into the new system?

        - Find tools for refining my own system of learning and writing
            - Attain better understanding and question my present understanding of note taking, learning, and writing
            - Right now, it seems like my notes exist in similar forms regardless of the reason I'm taking them, but I suspect that it will make a lot more sense to consider the "area" a note belongs to when creating it, storing it, and embedding it within the "graph" - but I still need to determine what those areas are for myself.
        - Have a better system for my writing, which currently include talks/speeches and blog posts
            - I'd some day like to write long form theoretical and practical non-fiction, so while supporting those shorter form and less strict contexts with as little friction as possible
        - Consider how note taking on "knowledge" fits in with note taking on "life" (eg, recipes, random bookmarks, important details of lease, etc.)
        - Refine the connection between my existing "life" systems - my to-do lists, personal project management, and tracking the information I need to exist in society, and my "knowledge" system, which is still being actively developed and is starting initially strongly informed by Luhmenn's and Ahren's writings.
- Session 2

        - What resonates with me:
            - Notes need to have a purpose or they end up just holding information you never see again; never use again. (IE, most of my notes >.>)
            - Notes are a part of a system and can't be considerered without the context of a system

    - From breakout: Daily journaling question: "What made today different?"
    - Sonke Q&A Session
        - Software v Pen&Paper:
            - Handwriting has some benefits over typing
            - Not an either-or q - Sonke often takes handwritten notes for clarification before permanent storing
            - Removing of friction with software is important, as long as you aren't thinking about the software more than the context you're thinking about
            - Screens can be a source of constant distraction but software is a net benefit for Ahrens
        - Routines and the Process of Writing
            - 3 months isn't enough time to develop a routine
            - Warning: Don't look for a perfect system, a perfect system can't have an automatic and identical daily routine but rather depends on the states of projects
            - Balance immersing self in reading with taking notes - can spend weeks just reading and taking very few notes, highlights for spots to go back to take notes on, is a luxury but the question at hand determines the routine.
            - Routine is something to fall back on to, not something to choose first - when you're stuck, go to the routine to provide direction when stuck
        - Differences from Pen and Paper:
            - Larger notes in Roam bc block structure enables it
            - Note sequences usually in one note, but when it's not "densely connected", start a new note
            - Block References! (right click a bullet)
    - Rest of Session
        - Reading a book done in phases, which starts with reading for an overview with highlighting, then thinking more about what it actually means to take real notes
        - Reading and writing as practice for themselves, not just an ends
