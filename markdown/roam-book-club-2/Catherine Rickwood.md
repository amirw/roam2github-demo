- You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say? 
    - A Zettelkasten is an original idea or thought built on contemplation and critical analysis of the published work of others. 
- Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?
    - Yes. Whenever I find something interesting I want to read I immediately put it into Roam so that I can return to it and spend the time contemplating and critically reflecting on it to take fleeting notes.
    - My challenge is that I gather an enormous amount of information. Quickly. My ability to implement the note taking methodology is limited by time. Yet, I also know, have learned, and discovered that collecting information for information's sake is only valuable if I spend time processing it in the way outlined by Sonke.
- The book promotes a bottom up approach to note taking, which we have used in Book Club. Reflect on this. How did this feel? 
    - It makes sense as an approach to start with top-of-mind responses to a written piece. Get my own opinions and thoughts out of the way and down on paper. It's almost like decluttering the mind to clear space for a more objective review of what the author is conveying. Then, having done this, to be able to reflect on how these come together to form a new or original thought or idea. It reminds me of the reflection process in Siddha Yoga. P - O - W - E - R
        - **Prepare** the space. 
        - **Optimise** the question I'm seeking to answer. 
        - **Write** freely. 
        - **Engage** my higher self and ask a question such as: 'What more do I need to know or understand about this topic or idea?' Then, 
        - **Record** what comes up.
            - In a Zettalkesten approach, I would then review what I've written to discover the original thought I'd want to turn into a Zettel.
- What have you learnt about note taking that I (Sönke) should know about? 
    - Note taking is thoughtful. It's not the equivalent of copy typing. 
    - Note taking is not akin to reading a book for information or leisure and consuming it like snack food. Quickly satisfying a hunger or craving but once satisfied, not wanting or needing to think about it or reference it again. 
    - Considered note taking enables new ideas and thoughts to be created. Excitingly, those ideas can evolve fairly quickly.
    - Planning and organisation are crucial. So is discipline. P.O.D. 
        - These 3 elements provide a foundation for ease, simplicity, creativity, ideas, and innovation.
- Are there any additions to the process described in the book? 
- Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten (what use cases does it work for? 
- Are there any examples it doesn't work for?) Reflect on your impressions of the book  Reflect on your note taking and reading. 
- What if anything, has changed?
-  Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?

- About Me::  Since stumbling across [[Roam]] I feel like I've discovered an inner geek I didn't know existed. :) Loving learning all about it. Have binge-watched loads of videos, signed up to Andy's newsletter and Nat's course. Feel like I have a way to assimilate and record information to create new ideas and contribute to new knowledge and ways of viewing the world. Still a Roam beginner. :)
    - Live in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]]. However, since COVID, we moved to our property in the Wattamolla - 2.5 hours south of Sydney. 18.5 acres of rainforest, cleared land, and a gorgeous gurgling creek. Neighbours include wallabies, echidnas, wombats, snakes, spiders, deer, and cows. 
    - My work is dedicated to influencing attitudes and beliefs about how we use and think about the additional mostly healthy 20-30 years we've all been given to live. My [[TEDx]] talk 'Retirement is Redundant' encapsulates my central ideas and theme.
