            - ""Equally manageable is the task of bringing already existing notes into order, especially if half of them already are in order." Searching through a file system with strings of discussions, plenty of material and ideas is, believe it or not, fun. It does not require the kind of focused attention you would need to formulate a sentence or to understand a difficult text. Your attention is rather at ease and it even helps to have a playful mindset. Only with a less narrow focus will you be able to see connections and patterns. You see clearly where long strings of discussions have already been built up–this is a good starting point. If you do look for specific notes, you have an index to turn to. No problem at all so far."
