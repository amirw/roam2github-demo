- I'm from Switzerland, joining from UK. I was new to Roam and to Zettelkasten as well, an so far I've enjoyed both the experience of the Roam Book Club and the wonderful Roam community a lot.

        - #[[Question 1]] 
            - I would write on my iPad, not on paper.
            - I like the idea of having a system like Roam to structure my notes.
            - Try to break old habits feels like a battle agains oneself.

- Session 4 notes
    - Reflect on the book.  What are you impressions?
    - Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way?
        - Still hard to clearly see how to use the concept in my area of study (Physics) for details elements, rather clearer for more general concepts.
    - Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far?
        - Unexpected external time overload and constraints didn't help.
        - Being novice to Roam slows the process a lot when not having enough time at the beginning to learn sufficient basics.
    - How is your progress towards your initial goals? Or have they changed?
    - Explore the concept of permanent notes/zettels.
        - Explain what a permanent note is in your own words?
        - What is holding you back from creating zettels?
        - What are you unsure about? 
    - Do you have any questions for [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]]?

        - A personal synthesis of other note-s, no copy, quote, export
        - It should be brief
    - "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?"
        - Figuring what it is
        - How to apply it to Physics studies

    - To summarize
        - We have the best chance to change our behaviour over the long term if we start with a realistic idea about the difficulties of behavioural change (Dean 2013). And that is not so easy, because the more we are used to doing something in a particular way, the more in control we feel about it, even though we are less in control of it. (This is in part also due to the aforementioned mere-exposure error.)
