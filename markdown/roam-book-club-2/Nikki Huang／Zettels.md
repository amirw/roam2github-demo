            - The power of the Zettelkasten system lies in its ability to facilitate entry into flow states where work feels effortless and energising, akin to a spontaneous exothermic reaction.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] **Version 1:** We can draw an [[analogy]] between the dynamics of work and [[thermodynamics]]. Sometimes, we need to put in a lot of energy in order to get keep working, like in an endothermic reaction. At other times, however, work can be an effortless and energising [[positive feedback loop]], akin to a spontaneous exothermic reaction. The latter is what we want to aim for. 
            - This is more of a paraphrase and less original than what I came up with by asking myself questions like "Why did that resonate with you" and "What else resonated?" #Reflection
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] **In-depth version:** Metaphors and appeals to pre-existing popular concepts of flow states and positive feedback loops can be a good way to promote the power of Zettlekasten for making work effortless.
            - In the process of studying the chemistry
                - I'm literally doing a chemistry uni course
                    - I'm studying chemistry right now
            - I love metaphors and analogies
                - There's a thrill each time
                    - When it works
                    - Really powerful
                - Honors Thesis was about metaphor theory
                    - Shaping and shifting the way people think
                        - A good metaphor can have a lot of motivation power
                            - And inspiration
            - Personal experience
                - Flow state

                        - Not like work
                    - Seeing connections
                    - When I feel like I'm on to something
                        - I can see what they mean, when they work gaining momentum
                    - Everyone experiences the opposite
                        - Completing the task you don't want to do
            - Zettelkasten
                - Hopefully get us into this effortless work state
                    - That's pretty cool
                        - I'm thinking beyond to promote this sytem
                            - To convince them to use this system
                                - Flow state is a buzzword
                                    - For a decade or more
                - This isn't a conscious thought, but if I wanted to promote it--in an educational setting
                    - Some kind of evidence, showing that this system
                        - Experiences flow state
            - Positive feedback loop idea
                - Joined a community
                    - It was The Mental Models

- **Process**
    - 1. Make fleeting notes: 
        - Purpose:: Remind you of anything that popped up in your mind as you were reading 
        - Guidelines:: 
            - quick
            - don't worry about organising
            - doesn't need to be in full sentences
            - don't let it interrupt the flow of reading
        - Ask:: 
            - Why did this resonate with me?
            - What else does it make me think of?
        - Questions::
            - Are we meant to try and summarise all of our random thoughts into a single fleeting note before proceeding to the literature notes stage?
    - 2. Make literature notes
        - Purpose:: Have a summary of main points that you don't want to forget, or could be useful later
        - Guidelines::
            - Be really concise and selective (don't clutter your brain unnecessarily!)
            - Put things into your own words to check understanding
        - Ask::
            - What do I want to remember and why?
    - 3. Make permanent notes
        - Purpose:: Have pieces of really useful long-term knowledge that can be connected to other ideas in order to develop arguments, discussions or generate ideas over time.
        - Guidelines::
            - Don't just collect ideas: focus on developing arguments and discussions
            - Write so that another person can easily understand and find sources
            - Write each new idea or thought in response to the questions below as a separate note!
        - Ask::
            - How does this new information support, contradict or shed new light on what I already know?
            - How can I combine ideas to generate something new?
            - What questions have been triggered by these new ideas?
    - 4. Find connections!
        - Just use [[]] to search for notes with relevant keywords which you may have forgotten
