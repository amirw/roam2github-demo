            - [[consume]] & [[engage]]: (read, watch, listen, converse, reflect)
            - As content resonates with me, I save them as [[reference notes]] (capturing [[context]] ‚Äî [[bibliographical notes]], [[highlights]], and [[quotes]]) #capture
            - As my wanderings inspire thoughts and ideas, I save those ideas as [[fleeting notes]].
                - These are statements written inline with my notes. [[fleeting notes]] are **the first tier of notes worth documenting** in my [[interpretation]].
                - I keep the `originals` of these notes in a designated place. I keep a copy of the reference [[inline]] to preserve the context of where the note originated. 
                    - Example:: #[[Fleeting Notes]] The power of a [collaborative graph database]([[Multiplayer Roam]]) improves with the degree of alignment with key [[conventions]]. Data needs to be compiled in order to [compound]([[compounding]]).
                - [[supporting information]] is nested underneath the original block. As a block reference if necessary to preserve context of the related idea.
                - [[tags]] may be added inline at the end of the note or nested underneath to aid in [[connection]] and [[resurfacing]].
                - When adding new [[fleeting notes]] to my [[zettelkasten]], I locate them in close proximity to related notes and ideas. If they feel relevant to several different areas of the zettelkasten, I will create a [[reference]] to nest it underneath the other related note(s).
            - For content that I consider worth summarizing (the author makes great points that I would love to reference later in my own writing/ideas) ‚Äî I form `#Literature Notes` #[[literature notes]]
                - These are core concept summaries. They are **the author's ideas** phrased **in my own words**. They should be [[concise]] and [[atomic]] in nature. **Only one idea or concept per literature note**.
            - As both [[fleeting notes]] and [[literature notes]] accumulate, [[patterns]] emerge and my [[opinions]] embolden. When it feels like I can form a [permanent note]([[permanent notes]]) on the subject, I create one.
            - As [[project ideas]] arise through different stages of the workflow, I add them to a section of my [[zettelkasten]] called `[[Project Ideas]]`.
                - Over time, I link ideas that may be related to the project by referencing them as a [[nested block]].
                - Once a clear outline has formed, or enough [[content]] exists to easily begin [[writing]], **I complete the project and the cycle continues**. üéâü•Ç 
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] begin the writing process on a [project idea]([[project ideas]]) when it feels **easy** and **exciting**. #[[inspired action]]

        - "What I have in mind is unlike the old Zettelkasten where it was impossible to get a whole overview of it. In this medium I think you can get pretty close. One could trace through their permanent notes marking them as reviewed with a datestamp. Then you could pick this up at any point in time in the future and filter out the ones you have already reviewed, their review stage or review date ranges. Although I am yet to thoroughly think this through. Some possible markers could be something like `checked`, `open to more links`, `archive` or `up for deletion`. This tracing process would provide the opportunity to review the quality of your zettels and their connections in a systematic way. Sometimes you may not know how a zettel connects to another and only upon seeing it after reviewing a bunch of others you have made would that connection become clear. I would treat the `archive` tag with care or `up for deletion` tag with extreme caution. But having these here would allow you to ensure the quality of your zettelkasten over time with the ability to filter them out. "

        - Using spaced repetition for review:
        - "#Reply-from [[Jason Griffing]] I have not put anything nearly as sophisticated in place as what is described above. But I have started experimenting with a sort of spaced repetition method to keep the "rot" down. Every time I write a permanent note, and also for some literature notes I find more compelling, I simply drop a future date onto the end of the block. That way it pops up in my daily notes later for a refresher. I mark it sequentially with a 1,2,3 etc when it pops up so that I can tell how many times I've reviewed it. Sometimes in this process I come across notes that seemed so compelling when I wrote them but after a week or two, seem kind of worthless. I always struggle with knowing what to do with such notes. "

            - "#Zettels [[How I take notes]] - While I read, I select passages which will be thought provoking later. I set up systems that automatically get these into Roam. I translate the meaningful ones into my own words. I look for ways to group as many of them as possible, then write a bit which I can read later in isolation."

        - #[[Literature Notes]]
            - Write literature notes that are relevant to things you're thinking. Keep the slip-box in mind.
                - He usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes in the slip-box. And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his material. More often than not, a new note would directly follow up on another note and would become part of a longer chain of notes. He then would add references to notes somewhere else in the slip-box, some of them which were located nearby, others in completely different areas and contexts. Some were directly related and read more like comments, others contained not-so-obvious connections. Rarely would a note stay in isolation. [*](((zt7lrN7X2)))
            - Write literature and permanent notes as if you would publish them.
                - And while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with great care, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his material. [*](((zt7lrN7X2)))

    - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
        - #[[Literature Notes]]
            - Writing is not the archive of thinking, it is the very process of thinking itself. 
                - ‚ÄúNotes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible.‚Äù 
‚Äúno matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.‚Äù
- Neil Levy
"If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words. Thinking takes place as much on paper as in your own head."
[*](((RN5JKBqxJ)))
            - Take fleeting notes on things that resonate with you as you read. Some of these will later be processed into literature notes. Link these notes to the source. Always be prepared to take a quick note.
                - Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. Don‚Äôt worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on. These are fleeting notes, mere reminders of what is in your head. They should not cause any distraction. Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later. If your thoughts are already sorted and you have the time, you can skip this step and write your idea directly down as a proper, permanent note for your slip-box.[*](((pZ1dkTn5N)))
            - A good reason to take fleeting notes instead of literature notes as you read: they don't interrupt the flow of reading or conversation.
                - Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else. When you are in a conversation, listening to a lecture, hear something noteworthy or an idea pops into your mind while you are running errands, a quick (fleeting) note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of doing. That might even apply to reading, if you want to focus on a text without interrupting your reading flow. Then you might want to just underline sentences or write short comments in the margins. It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text.  [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
            - Process your fleeting notes within a day, otherwise they lose value. Why? Because you won't remember what you read as well.
                - Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. Fleeting literature notes can make sense if you need an extra step to understand or grasp an idea, but they will not help you in the later stages of the writing process, as no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument. These kinds of notes are just reminders of a thought, which you haven‚Äôt had the time to elaborate on yet. Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
            - To make a literature note, briefly summarize what you read into your own words. Get the gist. Do this for things that are relevant to your learning and projects. Be selective [*](((eRojO1adJ)))
                - "Write down what you don‚Äôt want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing."  [*](((eRojO1adJ)))
            - While literature notes point directly to the source, permanent notes point away. 
                - They connect ideas in the source to other things you've been thinking about and learning.
            - Quote sparingly. And if you do quote, also re-write it in your own words.
                - "Be extra selective with quotes‚Äìdon‚Äôt copy them to skip the step of really understanding what they mean."
[*](((eRojO1adJ)))
            - Add links to other permanent notes in the slipbox.
                - Make permanent notes. Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box‚Äìit only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them? [*](((y5dDNqTm7)))
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    - How to best connect different permanent notes?
                    - Permanent notes are the connectors between what you're currently reading and what you've already been thinking about it. 
                    - This is an essential step. 
                    - Link to notes with more unexpected connections.
            - Permanent notes are the insights that happen when you connect what you just learned with previous thinking and learning. Make these notes simple, concise and self-contained. Does this idea make sense to an eight-year old?
                - Write permanent notes with simple sentence so that someone else could understand what you're saying.
                    - Imagine explaining it to your Mom, or to an eight-year-old (not meaning to insult moms or eight-ye
                - Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box‚Äìit only contains what interests you anyway. [*](((y5dDNqTm7)))
                - Write one note for each idea.
                    - Make these notes brief and clear, so that anybody could understand what you are saying.
                    - Include references.
            - Permanent notes integrate, test, correct, support or add to the other ideas you're thinking about. 
                - Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them? [*](((y5dDNqTm7)))
            - Make the permanent note discoverable. Notes only have value when they are connected in a network.
                - In Roam this can be done with bidirectional links.
                - Avoid over-tagging. This starts to look like archiving.
                - Use spaced repetition so that the note is discovered later on. 
                    - In Roam, this can happen with the date picker.
                    - There's also some javascript plugins in Roam42 that do random queries. You could add this to your daily notes template and see ideas return that you've thought of before.
            - Watch as your thinking clusters around a topic or idea. 
                - So, instead of coming up with a topic and then sitting down to a blank page, you look to where these atomic notes have clustered. These are the topics and projects you are interested in. In this way, the **Zettelkasten is a dialog partner.** 
                - The Zettlekasten suggests what you want to work on, what you want to learn more about, what questions are still relevant.
                - It's also a way to test your ideas. Do any notes contradict each other?
                - What new questions arise?
            - Link together permanent notes that follow a similar chain of thought. The term for this is Fogelzettel.
                - This can be accomplished with nesting. So...this note on permanent notes has three levels of nesting. All these nested notes would be a single Fogelzettel.
            - Permanent notes should make sense when taken out of the context of the source.
                - Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from. [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
            - All the permanent notes that go into a topic are based on facts you've gathered in your reading.

            - If you're dedicated to learning, then you're always learning. 
                - You're always looking for connections; or perhaps just discovering them through inquiry.
                - In the last few years I've had to learn [[marketing]] and [[customer service]] for my online fiddle course. There was resistance to this. 
                - Marketing always seemed like a dirty word. But along the way I've come to see an intimate connection between marketing and education. Educating your customers is marketing. Talking to your customers teaches me what they want and need.
                - Listening to your customers is similar to listening to your [[Zettelkasten]]. Ideas emerge during the conversation. I don't have to sit around and try to think of the next lesson or blog. 
                - I have the opposite problem actually. I have trouble keeping up with the ideas which are being generated. Looking for ways to more easily publish things.
            - Work from where you are at in your notes. If you make a connection, take a new note within the current note instead of leaving the current note.
            - Experiment with using sketchnotes and diagrams while taking fleeting notes.
                - Physical books might be best for this.
            - While literature notes point directly to the source, permanent notes point away. 
                - They connect ideas in the source to other things you've been thinking about and learning.
            - Fleeting notes are  thoughts that are not yet supported by facts.
            - Add links to other permanent notes in the slipbox.
                - Make permanent notes. Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box‚Äìit only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them? [*](((y5dDNqTm7)))
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    - How to best connect different permanent notes?
                    - Permanent notes are the connectors between what you're currently reading and what you've already been thinking about it. 
                    - This is an essential step. 
                    - Link to notes with more unexpected connections.
            - Watch as your thinking clusters around a topic or idea. 
                - So, instead of coming up with a topic and then sitting down to a blank page, you look to where these atomic notes have clustered. These are the topics and projects you are interested in. In this way, the **Zettelkasten is a dialog partner.** 
                - The Zettlekasten suggests what you want to work on, what you want to learn more about, what questions are still relevant.
                - It's also a way to test your ideas. Do any notes contradict each other?
                - What new questions arise?
            - Link together permanent notes that follow a similar chain of thought. The term for this is Fogelzettel.
                - This can be accomplished with nesting. So...this note on permanent notes has three levels of nesting. All these nested notes would be a single Fogelzettel.

            - The slip-box is an external structure where you make connections and build larger ideas as you focus on more atomic ideas.
                - The slip-box provides an external scaffold to think in and helps with those tasks our brains are not very good at, most of all objective storage of information. [*](((vbI8TekIe)))
            - The four main Zettlekasten tools: A notebook (paper or digital), a reference management system, the slip-box, and an editor.
                - We need four tools: ¬∑ Something to write with and something to write on (pen and paper will do) ¬∑ A reference management system (the best programs are free) ¬∑ The slip-box (the best program is free) ¬∑ An editor (whatever works best for you: very good ones are free) More is unnecessary, less is impossible. [*](((t2VqNF_Q0)))
                    - The four essential tools can be contained within Roam. 
            - The essential work is reading, thinking, writing and understanding. This can be done with a notebook or an app Roam.
                - Computers can only speed up a relatively minor part of the work anyway, like adding links and formatting references. They can‚Äôt speed up the main part of the work, which is thinking, reading and understanding.  [*](((pBumj4c-s)))

            - When learning, it's not only important to know __how__ and __what__ you're learning, but also __why__ you're learning it.
                - And it is indeed crucially important not only to know how it works or how to work with it, but also why it works. Only then will you be able to tweak it for your own needs.  [*](((yIlbxuFst)))

            - #[[Literature Notes]]
                - Writing is not a way to express research results and thinking. Writing is research and thinking in itself.
                    - Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research. Nobody starts from scratch and everybody is already able to think for themselves. [*](((5Bxb_J2dj)))
                - Learning is a collective and public process. 
                    - The professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter. [*](((U0_AKhDHt)))
                    - There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas. [*](((5Bxb_J2dj)))
                    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Learning is an expression of non-duality.
                - Writing will change the way you read and learn. You'll learn more efficiently. You'll focus on what's relevant. You'll read with more engagement because your intention is to understand. You'll elaborate on the meaning and better remember what you read. You'll learn to think beyond what you've read. Finally, writing is a way to improve your thinking. 
                    - It will change the way you read as well: You will become more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannot write down everything. You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don‚Äôt understand what it is about. By doing this, you will elaborate on the meaning, which will make it much more likely that you will remember it. You also have to think beyond the things you read, because you need to turn it into something new. And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008).  [*](((9LdD6VzxA)))

                    - Malcolm McLean, inventor of the shipping container, didn't just focus on one part of the chain (the ship). His insight was to see how the delivery eco-system would be improved.
                        - Only after aligning every single part of the delivery chain, from packaging to delivery, from the design of the ships to the design of the harbours, was the full potential of the container unleashed. [*](((9eRcB8Tey)))
                    - This good simple idea had [[second-order effects]]. The cost of shipping went down, creating more traffic, and then more demand for shipping containers. As the containers were adopted, the benefits created a [[self-reinforcing positive feedback loop]]. #[[Mental model]]
                        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A second-order effect of working with the ZK is that my memory for random information seems to have improved. #[[Personal Insight üëÅ]] 
                            - When the advantages became obvious, second-order effects came into play and went into a self-reinforcing positive feedback loop. The more harbours were able to handle containers, the more container ships were needed to be built, which made shipping cheaper, which increased the range of goods worth shipping, which created more traffic, which made bigger container ships economical, which created more demand for infrastructure and so on. It wasn‚Äôt just another way of shipping goods. It was a whole new way of doing business. [*](((ziZQ-Jtg0)))
                    - Whereas older note-taking systems require you to underline, file things and search for them (which is distracting), the Zettlekasten allows you to focus on learning, thinking and writing.
                        - The slip-box is the shipping container of the academic world. Instead of having different storage for different ideas, everything goes into the same slip-box and is standardised into the same format. Instead of focusing on the in-between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published.  [*](((EVjA9eABJ)))
                    - The value of your notes will compound when you use the Zettlekasten. Different ideas talk to each other, leading to the birth of new ideas. More connections build up which leads to deeper understanding. The more connections you make, the more you remember. #compounding 
                        - What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. More notes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring related ones together in a playful way. But it should be just the opposite: The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones‚Äìand the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort. [*](((wIYnbucZC)))
                        - The biggest advantage compared to a top-down storage system organised by topics is that the slip-box becomes more and more valuable the more it grows, instead of getting messy and confusing. If you sort by topic, you are faced with the dilemma of either adding more and more notes to one topic, which makes them increasingly hard to find, or adding more and more topics and subtopics to it, which only shifts the mess to another level. The first system is designed to find things you deliberately search for, putting all the responsibility on your brain. The slip-box is designed to present you with ideas you have already forgotten, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. [*](((EVjA9eABJ)))
                    - Fleeting notes, permanent notes and project notes need to be separated. If you mix up fleeting and permanent notes, then you can't trust that your thinking is founded on facts.
                        - Only if the notes of these three categories are kept separated it will be possible to build a critical mass of ideas within the slip-box. One of the major reasons for not getting much writing or publishing done lies in the confusion of these categories. [*](((7_jHUj4nP)))
                    - Treating fleeting notes as permanent notes also means that your notes don't cluster around hidden topics. Your ideas are not talking to each other as much. They get lost.
                        - As he treats every note as if it belongs to the ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù category, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. On top of that, the strict chronological order does not offer any help to find, combine or rearrange ideas in a productive sense.  [*](((7GWVsCHA5)))
                    - Don't just collect notes that relate to a specific project you're working on. Collect notes on anything that is interesting to you. This way, you don't have to start the note-taking process from scratch for every new project.
                        - You decide on what you are going to write about and then collect everything that helps you to do that. The disadvantage is that you have to start all over after each project and cut off all other promising lines of thought. That means that everything you found, thought or encountered during the time of a project will be lost. [*](((HlsQj7ZDO)))
                    - So if your notes aren't organized into fleeting, permanent and project notes, then they become less valuable. But they compound if they are organized in a standardized format.
                    - All permanent notes could potentially be used in a larger project.
                        - In contrast to the fleeting notes, every permanent note for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece, but that can not be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments. **The notes are no longer reminders ** of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference. [*](((UZ4XCHfSA)))
                    - Project notes are notes on a specific project.

                    - Always be engaged in writing. Then you never have the stress of having to begin with a blank page.
                    - You don't make a decision about what to write about. You continuously write about what you learn and your own ideas on the subject, making connections as you go. #[[Decision Making]]
                    - Most of what we learn stems from some initial (as-yet-unproven) idea. These ideas are questions which guide our reading.
                        - And the decision to read something and not something else is obviously rooted in prior understanding, and that didn‚Äôt come out of thin air, either. Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. Basically, that is what Hans-Georg Gadamer called the [[hermeneutic circle]] (Gadamer 2004).  [*](((kvk3dCa8w)))
                    - Read and learn about things that interest you. Take notes on everything that is relevant. Then topics and projects will naturally emerge in an organized fashion. And you never start any project from scratch.
                        - By focusing on what is interesting and keeping written track of your own intellectual development, topics, questions and arguments will emerge from the material without force. 
If we look into our slip-box to see where clusters have built up, we not only see possible topics, but topics we have already worked on‚Äìeven if we were not able to see it up front. 
The idea that nobody ever starts from scratch suddenly becomes very concrete. If we take it seriously and work accordingly, we literally never have to start from scratch again. [*](((2U8Id9Bu8)))
                        - #Question   How can I apply this process to composing and recording music?
                    - Writing is not a linear but a circular process. As you follow your interests and take notes, your thoughts will continuously circle back to topics you're interested in. The result is you won't have to search for a topic but will have too many topics to choose from.
                        - Taking smart notes is the precondition to break with the linear order. There is one reliable sign if you managed to structure your workflow according to the fact that writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about. Having trouble finding the right topic is a symptom of the wrong attempt to rely heavily on the limitations of the brain, not the inevitable problematic starting point, as most study guides insinuate. If you on the other hand develop your thinking in writing, open questions will become clearly visible and give you an abundance of possible topics to elaborate further in writing. [*](((6ZfzhxuL5)))

                        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Krishnamurti and the stoics talk about the power of internal rewards. There is no need for motivation or external rewards if you love what you're doing.
                        - A good workflow can easily turn into a virtuous circle, where the positive experience motivates us to take on the next task with ease, which helps us to get better at what we are doing, which in return makes it more likely for us to enjoy the work, and so on.

                        - Feedback loops are not only crucial for the dynamics of motivation, but also the key element to any learning process.

They enter the virtuous circle where willpower isn‚Äôt needed anymore because they feel like doing it anyway.

[*](((ZLooaikXs)))
                    - People with a [[Growth Mindset]] actively seek out feedback and are ultimately more successful. People with a [[fixed mindset]] fear feedback because it might damage their self-image.
                        - The most reliable predictor for long-term success is having a ‚Äúgrowth mindset.‚Äù To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (and happiness) in the long run. 
Conversely, nothing is a bigger hindrance to personal growth than having a ‚Äú.‚Äù Those [with a fixed mindset] who fear and avoid feedback because it might damage their cherished positive self-image might feel better in the short term, but will quickly fall behind in actual performance (Dweck 2006; 2013). 
Ironically, it is therefore often the highly gifted and talented students, who receive a lot of praise, who are more in danger of developing a fixed mindset and getting stuck. Having been praised for what they are (talented and gifted) rather than for what they do, they tend to focus on keeping this impression intact, rather than exposing themselves to new challenges and the possibility of learning from failure. Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding). The orientation towards the latter makes one stick to safe, proven areas. The orientation towards the first draws the attention to the areas most in need of improvement. To seek as many opportunities to learn as possible is the most reliable long-term growth strategy.

                        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[Personal Growth]] I had an epiphany about myself reading this. As a kid, I was always told I was smart. At some point I must have wanted to protect this image and so developed a fixed mindset. I became less curious and began to make false assumptions about things.
Later in life, I magically became more curious. As I asked questions and learned more, I developed a growth mindset. Now I'm at the point in which all I want to do is learn.
                    - Always be learning. 
                        - To seek as many opportunities to learn as possible is the most reliable long-term growth strategy. [*](((AR7OaXAvj)))
                    - Failure leads to growth. Someone with a growth mindset welcomes the lessons of failure with curiosity. Someone with a fixed mindset avoids action that might lead to failure, and so they do not learn and grow.
                        - Feedback loops are not only crucial for the dynamics of motivation, but also the key element to any learning process. Nothing motivates us more than the experience of becoming better at what we do. And the only chance to improve in something is getting timely and concrete feedback. Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, or in the more general terms of psychologist Carol Dweck, to grow. Dweck shows convincingly that the most reliable predictor for long-term success is having a ‚Äúgrowth mindset.‚Äù To actively seek and welcome feedback, be it positive or negative, is one of the most important factors for success (and happiness) in the long run. Conversely, nothing is a bigger hindrance to personal growth than having a ‚Äúfixed mindset.‚Äù Those who fear and avoid feedback because it might damage their cherished positive self-image might feel better in the short term, but will quickly fall behind in actual performance (Dweck 2006; 2013). Ironically, it is therefore often the highly gifted and talented students, who receive a lot of praise, who are more in danger of developing a fixed mindset and getting stuck. Having been praised for what they are (talented and gifted) rather than for what they do, they tend to focus on keeping this impression intact, rather than exposing themselves to new challenges and the possibility of learning from failure. Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better (which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised (which is outwardly rewarding). The orientation towards the latter makes one stick to safe, proven areas. The orientation towards the first draws the attention to the areas most in need of improvement.

                    - Writing about what we read provides instant feedback. If you can't clearly write about something, then this feedback says that you clearly understand what you read or learned.
                        - Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read‚Äìuntil we try to rewrite it in our own words. [*](((XNIhRfrZU)))
                    - Writing permanent notes also provides feedback. It shows us where there are contradictions and inconsistencies between the new idea and older ideas.
                        - The same goes for writing permanent notes, which have another feedback loop built-in: Expressing our own thoughts in writing makes us realise if we really thought them through. The moment we try to combine them with previously written notes, the system will unambiguously show us contradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions. [*](((Xy_6Gvicd)))
                    - If what you learn is highly interconnected, then it becomes easier to remember and learn new things.
                        - We know today that the more connected information we already have, the easier it is to learn, because new information can dock to that information. If facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or [[latticework of mental models]] (Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information. That makes it easier not only to learn and remember, but also to retrieve the information later in the moment and context it is needed. [*](((E6qEFWAIg)))

                        - The good news is that we can train ourselves to stay focused on one thing for longer if we avoid multitasking, remove possible distractions and separate different kinds of tasks as much as possible so they will not interfere with each other. This too is not just a question of having the right mindset, but, equally important, of how we organise our workflow. A lack of structure makes it much more challenging to stay focused for extended periods of time. [*](((FUZKBnN4G)))
                    - Writing is made up of different tasks that require different kinds of attention.
                        - Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting. All these are not just different tasks, but tasks requiring a different kind of attention. It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time. [*](((sw97t7ucj)))
                    - Separate the tasks of writing (being a creator) and editing (being a critic). If you edit as you write, you run the risk of shooting down all your ideas and not making anything. If you write as you edit, then you don't get true feedback on what you've written because you don't __see__ what you've written; you only see your current thoughts.

It is a common issue that comes up during discussions with students: When I point out problems within the argument, an ill-defined term or just an ambiguous passage, students usually refer to what they mean first and only shift their focus to what they have written when they fully understand that what they mean is completely irrelevant within the scientific community.

                        - It is also easier to focus on finding the right words if we don‚Äôt have to think about the structure of the text at the same time, which is why a printed outline of the manuscript should be always in front of our eyes. We have to know what we don‚Äôt have to write about at the moment, because we know that we will take care of that in another part of our text. [*](((XzhfUwUyZ)))
                    - Outlining is a separate task from writing. Every so often, step away from writing to update your outline.
                        - We need a structure all the time, but as we work our way bottom-up, it is bound to change often. And whenever we need to update the structure (outline), we need to take a step back, look at the big picture and change it accordingly. [*](((VJrKLYhnV)))
                    - Develop [[flexible focus]]: the ability to swith between different kinds of thinking and attention. Go between making playful connections and careful analysis. This applies to both scientists and artists.
                        - Psychologists used to associate scientific work exclusively with focused attention, while other, more floating kinds of attention were exclusively associated with creative work like art.

                    - Writing things down frees up our short-term memory, allowing us to think more clearly. Using a trusted system means we don't worry about relying on our memory.
                        - Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory‚Äìuntil they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance. But thanks to Zeigarnik‚Äôs follow-up research, we also know that we don‚Äôt actually have to finish tasks to convince our brains to stop thinking about them. All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of. 
This is why David Allen‚Äôs ‚ÄúGetting things done‚Äù system works: The secret to have a ‚Äúmind like water‚Äù is to get all the little stuff out of our short-term memory. 
And... the only way to do that is to have a reliable external system in place where we can keep all our nagging thoughts about the many things that need to be done and trust that they will not be lost. [*](((E4Y2AJaeT)))
                    - We work on unsolved problems and questions when doing other activities, like walking or gardening.
                        - Conversely, we can use the Zeigarnik effect to our advantage by deliberately keeping unanswered questions in our mind. We can ruminate about them, even when we do something that has nothing to do with work and ideally does not require our full attention. Letting thoughts linger without focusing on them gives our brains the opportunity to deal with problems in a different, often surprisingly productive way. While we have a walk or a shower or clean the house, the brain cannot help but play around with the last unsolved problem it came across. And that is why we so often find the answer to a question in rather casual situations. [*](((tRi4T9gqd)))

                    - The literature note phase may be slow or quick depending on your current understanding and mental models. If it's a brand new subject, you may need to take more detailed literature notes. The goal is to create well-supported permanent notes.
                        - How extensive the literature notes should be really depends on the text and what we need it for. It also depends on our ability to be concise, the complexity of the text and how difficult it is to understand. 
It is mainly a matter of having an extensive latticework of mental models or theories in our heads that enable us to identify and describe the main ideas quickly 
Whenever we explore a new, unfamiliar subject, our notes will tend to be more extensive, but we shouldn‚Äôt get nervous about it, as this is the deliberate practice of understanding we cannot skip. 
Sometimes it is necessary to slowly work our way through a difficult text and sometimes it is enough to reduce a whole book to a single sentence. 
The only thing that matters is that these notes provide the best possible support for the next step, the writing of the actual slip-box notes. 
That often means to reflect as much on what is not mentioned as what is mentioned. [*](((7_-tgj41Q)))
                    - Focus on getting the gist of what you read instead of remembering details and quotes. 
                        - There is no secret to it and the explanation is pretty simple: Handwriting is slower and can‚Äôt be corrected as quickly as electronic notes. Because students can‚Äôt write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. But to be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in the first place. So if you are writing by hand, you are forced to think about what you hear (or read)‚Äìotherwise you wouldn‚Äôt be able to grasp the underlying principle, the idea, the structure of an argument. Handwriting makes pure copying impossible, but instead facilitates the translation of what is said (or written) into one‚Äôs own words. The students who typed into their laptops were much quicker, which enabled them to copy the lecture more closely but circumvented actual understanding. They focused on completeness. Verbatim notes can be taken with almost no thinking, as if the words are taking a short cut from the ear to the hand, bypassing the brain. [*](((fxe-n8Txn)))
                    - Seek out sources that challenge your argument. In this way you overcome unconscious [[confirmation bias]]. Charles Darwin did intentionally sought out disconfirming evidence.
                        - The very moment we decide on a hypothesis, our brains automatically go into search mode, scanning our surroundings for supporting data, which is neither a good way to learn nor research. Worse, we are usually not even aware of this confirmation bias (or myside bias[ 28]) that surreptitiously meddles with our life. Somehow, we just seem to happen to be surrounded by people who all think alike. (Not on purpose, of course. We just spend our time with people we like. And why do we like them? Correct: Because they think like us.) We just seem to happen to read the publications that tend to confirm what we already know. (Not on purpose, of course. We just try to stick with good, intelligent texts. And what makes us think these texts are good and intelligent? Correct: because they make sense to us.) We look around and just cut out dis-confirming facts without even noticing what we don‚Äôt see, very much like the same city can one day be full of happy people and the other day full of miserable ones, depending on our mood.

                        - Even the best scientists and thinkers are not free from it. What sets them apart is the mere fact that they are aware of the problem and do something about it. The classic role model would be Charles Darwin. He forced himself to write down (and therefore elaborate on) the arguments that were the most critical of his theories. ‚ÄúI had [...] during many years followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favorable ones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were raised against my views, which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer.‚Äù (Darwin 1958, 123) [*](((qc64s9vJP)))
                    - You can avoid falling into [[confirmation bias]] by gathering ideas __before__ you develop an argument.
                        - Confirmation bias is tackled here in two steps: First, by turning the whole writing process on its head, and secondly, by changing the incentives from finding confirming facts to an indiscriminate gathering of any relevant information regardless of what argument it will support.

                    - Zettelkasten is a [[First Principles Thinking]] method of writing. It starts from the atomic facts and ideas, allowing for insight to emerge. 
                        - Developing arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of top-down is the first and most important step to opening ourselves up for insight. We should be able to focus on the most insightful ideas we encounter and welcome the most surprising turns of events without jeopardizing our progress or, even better, because it brings our project forward. We postpone the decision on what to write about specifically and focus on building a critical mass within the slip-box. Instead of having the hypothesis in mind all the time, we want to: [*](((YO0sVbRjO)))
                            - Confirm that we have separated tasks and focus on understanding the text we read, ¬∑ Make sure we have given a true account of its content ¬∑ Find the relevance of it and make connections.
                            - Only then do we take a step back to look at what developed, then make a decision on what conclusions are to be drawn from that.

                    - Look for ideas that will enrich your current thinking. Learn to be excited by dis-confirming information. It allows for a more interesting discussion. Ask, What are the pros and cons of this argument?
                        - The slip-box forces us to be selective in reading and note-taking, but the only criterion is the question of whether something adds to a discussion in the slip-box. The only thing that matters is that it connects or is open to connections. Everything can contribute to the development of thoughts within the slip-box: an addition as well as a contradiction, the questioning of a seemingly obvious idea as well as the differentiation of an argument. What we are looking for are facts and information that can add something and therefore enrich the slip-box. One of the most important habitual changes when starting to work with the slip-box is moving the attention from the individual project with our preconceived ideas towards the open connections within the slip-box. [*](((2J1X0Ixx_)))
                        - After aligning our interests, we can go a step further and prime ourselves for seeking out dis-confirming facts. Collecting only one-sided ideas wouldn‚Äôt be very enriching. Yes, we have to be selective, but not in terms of pros and cons, but in terms of relevant or irrelevant. And as soon we focus on the content of the slip-box, dis-confirming data becomes suddenly very attractive, because it opens up more possible connections and discussions within the slip-box, while mere confirming data does not. It becomes easier to seek out dis-confirming data with practice and can become quite addictive. The experience of how one piece of information can change the whole perspective on a certain problem is exciting. And the more diverse the content of the slip-box is, the further it can bring our thinking forward‚Äìprovided we haven‚Äôt decided on the direction upfront. Contradictions within the slip-box can be discussed on follow-up notes or even in the final paper. It is so much easier to develop an interesting text from a lively discussion with a lot of pros and cons than from a collection of one-sided notes and seemingly fitting quotes. In fact, it is almost impossible to write anything interesting and worth publishing (and therefore motivating) if it is based on nothing else than an idea we were able to come up with up front before elaborating on the problem.

                        - As we write notes with an eye towards existing notes, we take more into account than the information that is already available in our internal memory. That is extremely important, because the internal memory retrieves information not in a rational or logical way, but according to psycho-logical rules. The brain also doesn‚Äôt store information neurally and objectively. We reinvent and rewrite our memory every time we try to retrieve information. The brain works with rules of thumb and makes things look as if they fit, even if they don‚Äôt. It remembers events that never happened, connects unrelated episodes to convincing narratives and completes incomplete images. It cannot help but see patterns and meaning everywhere, even in the most random things (cf. Byrne, 2008). The brain, as Kahneman writes, is ‚Äúa machine for jumping to conclusions‚Äù (Kahneman, 2013, 79). And a machine that is designed for jumping to conclusions is not the kind of machine you want to rely on when it comes to facts and rationality‚Äìat least, you would want to counterbalance it. Luhmann states as clearly as possible: it is not possible to think systematically without writing (Luhmann 1992, 53). Most people still think about thinking as a purely internal process, and believe that the only function of the pen is to put finished thoughts on paper.

The problem is that the meaning of something is not always obvious and needs to be explored. That is why we need to elaborate on it. But elaboration is nothing more than connecting information to other information in a meaningful way.

But by elaborating a little bit on this difference and asking the right questions, like ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù the students can connect this knowledge with prior knowledge, like their understanding of pressure and the function of the heart. Just by making the connection to the common knowledge that the heart presses the blood into the arteries, they immediately know that these walls need to sustain more pressure, which means they need to be thicker than veins, in which the blood flows back to the heart with less pressure. And, of course, this makes valves necessary to keep the blood from flowing back. Once understood, the attributes and differences are almost impossible to disentangle from the knowledge of veins and arteries. [*](((2Uq2Xd0uj)))

                - All writing is a dialog between past and future self, even if you've never heard of Zettlekasten. You write something and then read it back. So a grocery list is a dialog between your past and future self.

                - In teaching a piece of music, changing the context can aid learning across a wide set of skills. For example, a student could transpose a piece to another key, which would help them learn how to play in the new as well as deepen their understanding of the tune. 
                    - To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of abstraction and re-specification. [*](((ufyJtDIzl)))
                - Similar to writing, there's no formula for learning improvisation (in music). What's needed is a framework for deliberate practice. For example, call-and-response, playing with drones, tinkering with patterns are all frameworks which don't explicitly tell you what to do.

                - Writing in the slip-box is not just the transferrence of thoughts from your brain to physical form. It is a dialog that reflects thinking.
                - Actually, __all writing__ is a dialog between your past and future self. 
                - Similar to notes in a piece of music, notes in the slip-box only have meaning and value when they are connected to other notes in the slip-box.

                - Create keywords that allow for future discovery of the idea. Keywords should make new connections rather than to retrieve information. 
                    - The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference. [*](((37ECJavSi)))
                - Use keywords sparingly. References between notes are more valuable than the index.
                    - After adding a note to the slip-box, we need to make sure it can be found again. This is what the index is for. Luhmann wrote an index with a typewriter on index cards. In the Zettelkasten, keywords can easily be added to a note like tags and will then show up in the index. They should be chosen carefully and sparsely. Luhmann would add the number of one or two (rarely more) notes next to a keyword in the index (Schmidt 2013, 171). The reason he was so economical with notes per keyword and why we too should be very selective lies in the way the slip-box is used. Because it should not be used as an archive, where we just take out what we put in, but as a system to think with, the references between the notes are much more important than the references from the index to a single note. Focusing exclusively on the index would basically mean that we always know upfront what we are looking for‚Äìwe would have to have a fully developed plan in our heads. But liberating our brains from the task of organizing the notes is the main reason we use the slip-box in the first place. [*](((UjeoZyqmz)))
                - Assign keywords so that they point to things you're interested in and projects you're working on. How does this idea fit in to my slip-box? 
                    - Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation. [*](((UhUikcAob)))
                - Avoid creating obvious or overly-general keywords. For example, if talking about the mere-exposure effect, don't use #Psychology as a keyword. Use a keyword that relates to something you've been thinking or working on.
                    - Good keywords are usually not already mentioned as words in the note. Assume I have the note ‚ÄúA sudden increase of ad-hoc theories is for Kuhn a sign that a normal-science phase might be in crisis (Kuhn 1967, 96).‚Äù A fitting keyword might be ‚Äúparadigm change,‚Äù but that phrase is not in the note and therefore would not be suggested by the program.

                - The slip-box is a dialog partner.
                    - Our ideas will be rooted in a network of facts, thought-through ideas and verifiable references. The slip-box is like a well-informed but down-to-earth communication partner who keeps us grounded. If we try to feed it some lofty ideas, it will force us to check first: What is the reference? How does that connect to the facts and the ideas you already have? [*](((Xs1fLmaxP)))

                - Creating music demos and zettels is like beta testing a new product. For demos, the main question is "Is this interesting to me? Is it interesting to others?" 
If the answer is yes, then a followup question is, "How could it be improved?" and "What is the core thing that is truly good about this idea? How can I focus on the 20% which is truly valuable?"

                - To begin a project, look through your slipbox to find clusters of permanent notes.
                    - Look through the connections and collect all the relevant notes on this topic (most of the relevant notes will already be in partial order), copy them onto your ‚Äúdesktop‚Äù[ 6] and bring them in order. Look for what is missing and what is redundant. Don‚Äôt wait until you have everything together.

                - Once you've discovered your topic, you begin the process of focusing your argument. You begin to prune less relevant ideas and synthesize your notes into an outline, a draft, and eventually a finished piece.
                    - The perspective changes another time: Now, it is not about understanding something in the context of another author‚Äôs argument, and it is also not about looking for multiple connections in the slip-box, but about developing one argument and bringing it into the linearity of a manuscript. Instead of widening the perspective to find as many possible lines of thought to which an idea might contribute, it is now about narrowing the perspective, making a decision on one topic only and cutting out everything that does not directly contribute to the development of the text and support the main argument.

                    - While we want to find topics that are important, interesting and can be dealt with using the material we have available, the brain prioritises ideas that are easily available in the moment. This, obviously, does not equal relevant. 
The brain more easily remembers information that it encountered recently, which has emotions attached to it and is lively, concrete or specific. Ideally, it rhymes as well (cf. Schacter, 2001; Schacter, Chiao and Mitchell, 2003). 
Everything that is rather abstract, vague, emotionally neutral or does not even sound good is far down on its list of priorities‚Äìnot exactly the best criteria for an intellectual endeavour. [*](((TNZTnyXIC)))
                - The slip box is an idea generation machine. So there is no need for brainstorming. 
                    - On the other hand, we who have already accompanied our studies by writing and collecting notes in a smart way simply don‚Äôt have the need for brainstorming anymore. We can just look into our slip-box instead. [*](((UQ6LCIFw5)))
                - Clusters of ideas in the slip box show us that there is genuine interest and support for an idea. This is different than the emotional excitement we feel when we have a new idea but no support for that idea yet.
                    - If we had a good idea before, it will be in there. 
It might even already have proved itself worthy of following up on, in which case it is already connected to supporting material. **It is so much easier to see what worked than to predict what might work.** [*](((UQ6LCIFw5)))
                - The slip-box is a tool to test your ideas before launching into a longer project.
                    - If we, on the other hand, let questions arise from the slip-box, we know that they are tried and tested among dozens or even hundreds of other possible questions. The vast majority of questions might have been answered quickly or disappeared as no notes were drawn to them, either because of a lack of interest or a lack of material. This is how evolution works: by trial and error, not planning. [*](((30eozOwaL)))
                - If we are intimate with what we've learned, then we are better able to create an original idea or work.
                    - It seems counterintuitive that we become more open to new ideas the more familiar we are with ideas we have already encountered, but historians of science will happily confirm this (Rheinberger 1997). It makes sense when you think about it: without intense elaboration on what we already know, we would have trouble seeing its limitations, what is missing or possibly wrong. Being intimately familiar with something enables us to be playful with it, to modify it, to spot new and different ideas without running the risk of merely repeating old ideas believing they are new. This is why it feels in the beginning that familiarity makes it harder to come up with new ideas. We just didn‚Äôt know that most of the ideas we had are actually not that innovative. But while the belief in our own ingenuity decreases with expertise, we become more able to actually make a genuine new contribution. [*](((wYgj-NeXq)))
                - Students are motivated when they understand why the topic is important and when they feel in control of what they are learning.
                    - It is not surprising that motivation is shown to be one of the most important indicators for successful students‚Äìnext to the feeling of being in control of one‚Äôs own learning course. When even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it‚Äôs most often because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their own studies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan, 2006; Reeve, 2009).

                - When you learn about things that interest you, you discover new things that interest you.
                    - If we accompany every step of our work with the question, ‚ÄúWhat is interesting about this?‚Äù and everything we read with the question, ‚ÄúWhat is so relevant about this that it is worth noting down?‚Äù we do not just choose information according to our interest. By elaborating on what we encounter, we also discover aspects we didn‚Äôt know anything about before and therefore develop our interests along the way. It would be quite sad if we did not change our interests during research. [*](((-Cl18HUNX)))
                - If you get stuck on a project, switch to something else that interests you.
                    - Remember: Luhmann‚Äôs answer to the question of how one person could be so productive was that he never forced himself to do anything and only did what came easily to him. ‚ÄúWhen I am stuck for one moment, I leave it and do something else.‚Äù When he was asked what else he did when he was stuck, his answer was: ‚ÄúWell, writing other books. I always work on different manuscripts at the same time. With this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.‚Äù (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 125‚Äì55) It is like martial arts: If you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it, but redirect it towards another productive goal. The slip-box will always provide you with multiple possibilities. [*](((2WQrQNiI-)))
                - Working with a flexible system allows you to change direction as your interests change. 
                    - The ability to change the direction of our work opportunistically is a form of control that is completely different from the attempt to control the circumstances by clinging to a plan. The beginning of the research project that led to the discovery of DNA‚Äôs structure was the application for a grant. The grant was not to discover DNA‚Äôs structure, but find a treatment for cancer. If the scientists had stuck to their promises, not only would they probably not have found a cure for cancer, but they definitely would not have discovered the structure of DNA. Most likely, they would have lost interest in their work. Luckily, they did not stick to their plan, but followed their intuition and interest and took the most promising path to insight whenever one opened up. The actual research program developed along the way (Rheinberger 1997). One could say they finished the plan on what to do the very moment they finished the whole project. [*](((yci8SvoAM)))
                - It's easier to change course if you are continuously working in small steps instead of planning long-range projects. It's better to visualize the steps in a project or training than to visualize the end result.
                    - The ability to keep control over our work and change course if necessary is made possible by the fact that the big task of ‚Äúwriting a text‚Äù is broken down into small, concrete tasks, which allows us practically to do exactly what is needed at a certain time and take the next step from there. It is not just about feeling in control, it is about setting up the work in a way that we really are in control. And the more control we have to steer our work towards what we consider interesting and relevant, the less willpower we have to put into getting things done. Only then can work itself become the source of motivation, which is crucial to make it sustainable. [*](((I6Gh5naNy)))
                - Working on multiple projects at a time means that by-products and leftovers from one project inform and populate another project.
                    - Another key point: Try working on different manuscripts at the same time. While the slip-box is already helpful to get one project done, its real strength comes into play when we start working on multiple projects at the same time. The slip-box is in some way what the chemical industry calls ‚Äúverbund.‚Äù This is a setup in which the inevitable by-product of one production line becomes the resource for another, which again produces by-products that can be used in other processes and so on, until a network of production lines becomes so efficiently intertwined that there is no chance of an isolated factory competing with it anymore.

                    - If we read something that is interesting, but not directly relevant to our current project, we can still use it for another project we are working on or might work on. Everything that enriches our slip-box has the potential to end up in a text we might write. By taking smart notes, we collect en passant the material for our future writings in one place. The projects we work on can be in completely different stages of completion. Some of them might not even have come to our attention. This is advantageous not only because we make progress on the next papers or books while we are still working on the current one, but also because it allows us to switch to other projects whenever we get stuck or bored.

                - Most people are over-confident when planning because they focus on the outcome instead of the necessary steps towards finishing a project. 
                    - The lesson to draw is to be generally sceptical about planning, especially if it is merely focused on the outcome, not on the actual work and the steps required to achieve a goal. While it doesn‚Äôt help to imagine oneself the great author of a successful and timely finished paper, it does make a difference if we have a realistic idea about what needs to be done to get there in our minds. We know from sports that it doesn‚Äôt help when athletes imagine themselves as winners of a race, but it makes a big difference if they imagine all the training that is necessary to be able to win. Having a more realistic idea in mind not only helps them to perform better, it also boosts their motivation (Singer et al. 2001). We know today that this is not only true for athletes, but for any work that needs effort and endurance (Pham and Taylor 1999). Writing definitely belongs in this category. [*](((i-J1kvZAs)))

                    - We have the best chance to change our behaviour over the long term if we start with a realistic idea about the difficulties of behavioural change (Dean 2013). And that is not so easy, because the more we are used to doing something in a particular way, the more in control we feel about it, even though we are less in control of it.

Quite the contrary: It allows the learner to let his or her own thinking become decentralised within a network of other ideas. Learning, thinking and writing should not be about accumulating knowledge, but about becoming a different person with a different way of thinking. This is done by questioning one‚Äôs own thinking routines in the light of new experiences and facts. [*](((AEToJgvmY)))

                    - The most reliable predictor of our behaviour in the immediate future is‚Äìsurprise, surprise‚Äìthe intention to do it. If we decide to go to the gym now, the chance is that we really do go to the gym now. But this is, unfortunately, only true for the very immediate future. When it comes to the long run, researchers struggle to find any measurable connection between our intentions and our actual behaviour (Ji and Wood 2007; Neal et al. 2012). There is one exception, though: we most certainly act according to our intention if we happen to intend to do exactly what we used to do before. [*](((DAESrQc3M)))

                - Make connections. Look for further, more unexpected connections.
            - I've started a Zettlekasten in my own graph.
            - I'm still struggling with the tech side of setting up the Zettlekasten in Roam. 
                - In particular, I'm struggling with setting up relevant notes correctly.
                    - This is a technical point, but today it has blocked me from seeing the connections between the different ideas.
                        - It's interesting to note that when I feel unconfident with the system, then i trust it less. Ideas don't happen as fluidly.
                        - When there is #trust, then there is more #flow.
                        - 
    - "Reflect on your impressions of the book "
        - This is a book about learning and thinking.
        - It's been one of the most life-changing books I've read.
            - I know this is #[[counterfactual thinking]], but I wish I would have learned this when I was eight years old. Meditation too! 
                - Still, very grateful to have found the book, Roam, and this book club üôè
            - I don't think I'll read another book, listen to another podcast, or watch another movie without taking some notes. (Unless it's not interesting, in which case, I probably won't finish.)
            - I feel like these ideas could radically change education as we know it.
                - #Question    I wonder how long it will take for the broader public to see the value in the Zettlekasten?
- Session 7 December 13, 2020
    - "You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say? "
        - A Zettlekasten is an external system for thinking more clearly. 
            - Without an external system we would need to rely entirely on our memory, which is not reliable.
            - But the ZK is not a warehouse of ideas and facts. 
                - It's an idea generation machine.
                    - How does it generate ideas?
                        - The ZK is a dialog partner, a creative collaborator.
                            - When you take new notes, you look at notes you've already taken.
                                - In this way, your notes talk to each other.
                                    - This leads to novel connections and new insights.
            - A fun way to look at it: the Zettlekasten is your second brain.
        - It's an idea generation machine.
            - How does it generate ideas?
                - The ZK is a dialog partner, a creative collaborator.
                    - When you take new notes, you look at notes you've already taken.
                        - In this way, your notes talk to each other.
                            - This leads to novel connections and new insights.
        - As I see it, there are two essential principles using the Zettlekasten system.
            - When you read or learn something, write about that in your own words.
                - Writing is a way to test your understanding. 
            - Make connections between different things you've learned.
                - Carefully think about how this relates to other things you've learned.
                    - The careful connection of notes means that all these ideas don't exist in isolation.
                - Avoid tagging of notes into overly general categories like #Psychology.
        - What are the benefits of using the ZK?
            - You more easily remember what you'll read.
            - You more deeply understand what you read.
            - It helps you to generate new ideas and insight.
        - Why do you use a Zettlekasten
            - For most people, it's difficult to remember everything they've learned.
                - The Zettlekasten is a tool to help you find and connect
        - 
    - "Reflect on the shared multi-player zettelkasten of Book Club"
        - It's mind boggling to think of how this could influence publishing and education in the future.
            - Publications could be dynamic, changing as new information comes to light.
            - The reading and learning process would accelerate as people can make comments at the block level.
                - As it stands, people can make general comments about the whole book or article in a review or comment. 
        - This was an amazing help in learning the ZK process.
            - Simply looking at the process of others helped me to find my own way.
        - There was a bit of friction in bringing the notes from the multiplayer to the personal graph.
            - I'm sure the Roam geniuses are working on this, but it would improve the multiplayer experience if we could port the notes we take there in our personal graphs.
                - But...this is a minor point. Manually copying and pasting is a small price to pay for the amazing experience of [[collective learning]] in Roam.
