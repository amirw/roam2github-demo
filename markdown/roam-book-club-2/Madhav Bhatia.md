    - About the book in general
    - [[Questions for SÃ¶nke]]
        - What is the workflow that you use in Roam in order to implement the fleeting notes, literature notes theory?
        - Should one send the majority of the day in building on the slip box or to find new sources to find fleeting notes? How do you organise the mixture?
        - "Our group question for SÃ¶nke Ahrens:: How do you limit the overwhelm with notetaking - can there be too many notes?
#[[Questions for SÃ¶nke]]" - Interesting. Does this link to the above question? In a general sense, more notes would be better. but the tradeoff is to spend time on new notes building the earlier notes
        - "Can you give an example of the transition from literature notes to permanent notes?" - Notice that you have not really been using this bucket since roam elimated the need for the same?
        - Does the method in addition to increasing the productivity also increase the quality. What has your personal experience been?
- [[Notes]]
    - Handwriting has benefits; typing does not. Sure? - Compare with studies cited by [[Ali Abdal]] when he introduced [[anki]]

- Interacting with the community
    - "Looking for #Roamans from #India #Chat"
        - "[[Palash]] Hey [[Siva Arunagiri]], I'm from #India. I know a few more people from India who use Roam, but generally the timings are a deterrent to them joining (1"30AM). Looking forward to probably switch to [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]]'s 1:30 PM session, based on the number of people."
            - "I found [[Madhav Bhatia]] by looking through the unlinked references (linked now ðŸ™‚)"
            - "for how to use chat (I was a but confused, going with the '@' method here)"
                - ""(Retired) The CSS below will take any link with "@" in front of it and turn it into a bright color. 

Note that CSSes only function if they are the active "version" - these have been turned off by being hidden into inactive "version".

Then, when you've read it, change it to "~" and it will turn green. ""
                - "[[Siva Arunagiri]] Thanks for the tip. But I guess it would be rather helpful if I just change it to my original page name so that I can have all communication in my page directly. "
                    - "[[Palash]] that might make it a bit confusing, we are using '@'/'~' to keep a tab of tags/seen status vs. who typed; I think. You can always use queries to pull in all of them into your page if needed :)  [[Siva Arunagiri]]"
        - "[[Ayush Verma]] Hey [[Siva Arunagiri]], I'm also from #India but was not able to connect due to the meeting time. (1:30 AM). I would love to talk to other #Roamans from #India."
        - "[[dinesh]] Hey [[Siva Arunagiri]] and [[Palash]] I'm from #India. Good to see more folks from here. the timing is certainly a huge deterrent. just like [[Ayush Verma]] i wasnt able to join due to the timing. also i am very new to #Roam and would love to talk to other #Roamans from #India"
    - Other people from India who use Roam
        - "**Fellow Roamans from India:**"
            - [[Palash]]
            - [[Ayush Verma]]
            - [[dinesh]]
            - [[Prabu Rajasekaran]]
    - Also had a good chat with [[Alex Shchedrin]], [[Mircea Sibana]]
- Collecting the roam experience - whether it actually does what it promises?
    - What is the [[Meno's paradox]] - hmmm. Fleeting notes and [[literature notes]] help you solve this issue
        - "Pg 26: [[Meno's paradox]] it's unlikely that every text you read will contain exactly the information you need; otherwise, you must have already known what was in there and wouldn't have had reason to read it in the first place"
            - "the only way to find out if something is worth reading, is by reading it"
            - "even if a text isn't perfectly aligned to your "idea" it is still a good exercise to make permanent notes so that you can accumulate more critical mass that can lead to new insight"
    - FACING THE EXACT SAME ISSUE - Notice however that Sonke actually suggests that you delet the fleeting note once you are done. The main issue is the with the literaure notes. I however, think that it is not important to figure out whether you have processed your literature notes because the same might be used in multiple contexts and once you have tagged it as processed, you will tend to filter this out. [*](((SOIkRWCj_)))
    - I also realise that this exploring is much more relevant when I process the permanent notes instead of fleeting notes of others. Note how easy it is to build upon a fleshed out thought.
