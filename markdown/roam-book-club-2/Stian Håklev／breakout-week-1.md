- "template ðŸ§©: report back from small group"
    - Breakout Group Number - 39

        - Who was in this group on 11.1.20::
            - [[Karsten]] [[Kaitlin]] [[Stian HÃ¥klev]]
        - What did your group talk about?::
            - Mostly chit-chat about Roam and the book - other members were quite new to both
        - Any questions for the book club as a whole?::
        - Our group question for SÃ¶nke Ahrens::
(#[[question for Soenke]])
            - I heard a challenge from [[Andy Matuschak]] (earlier) - is there evidence that the most high-performing/groundbreaking intellectuals are using similar techniques, or would significantly benefit? Seems like (paraphrased by me) some of us are going very deep on note taking, but aren't necessarily able to make huge contributions to the world, whereas the iconoclasts are a lot less structured?
