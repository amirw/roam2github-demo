            - OK. Just getting to this spot took a few minutes. 
            - The goals that brought me here, were, I suppose, already formed on at least a subconscious level, i.e. if I join in on a large enough focused, group activity -- with Roamers -- on a spectrum of different levels, then I cannot help but come away a better Roamer! Sort of like the concept of your life reflecting the lives of the 5 people closest to you.
            - This proximity impact is something I'm already feeling, in that just in the past six/seven weeks, because of my determination to learn Roam well enough to do what I call "Dance with it" I've  met the most stimulating people! This is such a contrast to what could be called my normal life as a retiree who lives alone and doesn't go out much - even before COVID-19. It's amazing, and quite a healthy thing, too!
            - What more worthy goal could there be? Mental stimulation; a way to capture that; and interesting/fascinating companions to do it with. I'm in love!
    - [[Post-Session Notes to Self]]
        - Just to see if I'd muddled successfully enough through the live in-session instructions to be found in a search, I tried searching for my name. Got nothing but dinging bells... 
            - Then just to be sure the search command I was using actually worked, I search for a name I had already seen on the Community Page. Ergo, Boom! I had only to put in his first name and his entries were already viewable!
            - Wow... OK. Definitely have to retrace my steps. Find and correct my errors.
        - Wow, I was assigned to Breakout Group #42. SIgnificant? or What? 42 is a heavy duty number, isnt it? 
            - ^^Confirm breakout group # 42 or 46 or ?^^
