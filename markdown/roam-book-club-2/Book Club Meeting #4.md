- "Reflect on the book.  What are you impressions? "
    - I enjoyed learning about Nik Luhmann and how he used a slip-box/zettelkasten. I liked the analogy of a Zettelkasten to a dialogue partner; it reminds me of the notion of a second brain. I was amazed that Nik captured his notes all on index cards and was really intrigued to explore how such a system could be replicated in Roam. It makes me think about what each part of his system is and which components get translated, replicated, and modified,
    - "Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way? "
        - I think literature notes can be useful to solidify your understanding of a topic. I think of them like literature reviews from science, where multiple papers are analyzed. 
    - "Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? "
        - It has been hard to create my workflow. The process is very non-linear with a lot of trial and error. 
    - "How is your progress towards your initial goals? Or have they changed?"
        - My goal was to create a workflow for capturing information and transforming it to content that can be shared with others. I initially thought I would create a page called "Zettelkasten" where I put culminating thoughts on a subject - my most processed thoughts - but now I'm questioning that approach. 
        - "Explore the concept of permanent notes/zettels."
            - Permanent notes are the most processed notes. They're ones that have been through all stages of the knowledge hierarchy, from highlighting to bolding to taking notes in your own words, to literature notes, to permanent notes. 
        - Break out room 1
            - Chatted with [[Elaine Giles]] [[Viv]] [[StephanC]] [[Rob Berger]]
            - [[Tiago Forte]]'s 2nd brain course he asks: "What are your 12 areas of interest?" e.g, how can i make housing more affordable? 
            - Between a literature note and a permanent note is a project note 
            - search functionality is so robust you can always find something you need
            - [[Viv]] mentioned that Permanent Notes to her = remixing
            - PARA/Zettelkasten is a hierarchical system. Roam is not. Folders are not important.
