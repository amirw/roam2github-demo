    - This is a similar question I have. How do you maximize connectivity? How do I recall what I have forgotten? I wonder if best practices will emerge for this in a Roam ecosystem.

    - I've similarly wondered this same question. Is it worthwhile to have a unique numbered system and an Index page or is the All Pages adequate in a Roam system? If so, does that mean that each permanent note needs to be created as its own page?

    - ""He not only stressed that he never forced himself to do something he didn’t feel like, he even said: “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f.)" - p. 15"
"How organised are you with your writing? Do you need a deadline to get things written? Can you be productive without a deadline?"
""[...this is...] a great insight of David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001): There are few serious knowledge workers left who haven’t heard of “GTD” and that is for a good reason: It works. The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended to do, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture. Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us. Only if nothing else is lingering in our working memory and taking up valuable mental resources can we experience what Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts." - p. 10 "
