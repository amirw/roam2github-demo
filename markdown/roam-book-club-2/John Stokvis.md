- Fleeting Notes:: 
- "[[Introduction]]"
    - If writing is discussed, the focus lies almost always on the few exceptional moments where we write a lengthy piece, a book, an article or, as students, the essays and theses we have to hand in. At first glance, that makes sense: these are the tasks that cause the most anxiety and with which we struggle the longest.[*](((UKS0xc-e1)))
        - These are also the most likely to be final products, rather than aids for the process of thinking.
            - It unconsciously focuses us on complete solutions (the essay, the book) rather than, the process of getting to the solution (a draft, scribbles, half formed thoughts)
                - I know this habit has contributed to my [[writer's block]]
                    - pushing out a complete, final product is daunting
                    - that’s what I get by focusing on the end result and not the process
    - **What they all have in common, though, is that they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper.**[ 1] But by doing this, they ignore the main part, namely note-taking, failing to understand that improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference. **They seem to forget that the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development. **This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But most of all, you can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward. [*](((AmpvncRaE)))
        - 1000 times this!
    - The feedback loop on bad note taking is extremely delayed [*](((1NqxVWlvh)))
    - Writing does not start with the blank page just as [[creativity]] and [[invention]] doesn’t start with a great idea.  [*](((VQiKWP6bz)))
        - It starts __way__ earlier as I wander and explore ideas without knowing what the conclusion will be.
    - It’s not about [[talent]],  it’s about persistent improvement and [[hard work]]
        - This is why many [[overnight success]]es only seem sudden.
            - In fact, their success is the result of many years of hard work
                - It’s just that other people discovered their hard work overnight
            - Examples
                - [[Lizzo]]
                - [[Sarah Cooper]]
                - [[Tig Notaro]]
    - You don’t need [[willpower]]. you need [[discipline]]
- "[[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]"
    - Knowledge will flow like water.
        - You can’t force it. It finds the path of least resistence
    - Our [[conscious attention]] ([[focus]]), takes [[energy]]
        - if we free up our [[attention]] from the burden of [[memory]], we can use it for shaping [[arguments]] and [[ideas]]
        - that’s what good [[structure]] is for
            - [[structure]] ≠ a plan
                - a plan requires **more** [[willpower]] to stick to the plan
                - planning isn’t FUN!
                    - structure allows room for play
                        - games and sports are full of structure, that’s why they’re fun
            - good [[structure]] ≠ lots of structure
                - while the willow bends in a great wind, the oak will break
    - Try not to focus on the system before starting.
        - just start
            - do it
                - the system will develop just like the ideas are meant to
                    - organically as you go
        - no need to go back and redo everything.
            - when I come across some old note, I can deal with it then
                - if i never come across it again, it wasn’t that important
                - if i duplicate it, that’s fine
                - if i can’t stop thinking about it, i’ll probably revisit it
    - [[writing]] is not a linear process
        - neither is [[thinking]]
            - no wonder it’s hard to use a writing tool to think with
                - especially if we’re used to writing linearly
    - how can my fleeting thoughts lead to something more
        - ah! fleeting notes! i get it!
    - a note’s value is not just in the context it was written, but in all the other places it connects 
    - it seems weird to question the concept that [[work]] isn’t fun
        - that hard work should be drudgery
        - yet fun is motivating
            - so making work fun is great way to do more and better work
            - is it still work if it’s enjoyable?
                - if work = effort, yes
                - if work = unpleasant, no
    - it’s not just about the tool, it’s how to use it
    - the slip box
        - step 1: take notes on information you take in
        - step 2: think and process those notes, then write notes based on those thoughts
        - step 3: connect those notes to other notes that already exist
        - step 4: create indexes as entry points to lines of thought
- "[[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]"
    - i’ve always been good at editing something that already exists
        - writing like this is just about [[collecting]] things i’ve already written and then editing it down
    - the [[process]] makes more sense working [[backwards]]
        - edit the existing text to tighten it up
        - convert notes into an argument by ordering them
        - collect thoughts related to a specific topic and look for any gaps and fill them in
        - connect notes to other notes so you can find them again when you need them
        - write down thoughts into notes
        - **thinking** = the real work
    - fleeting notes
        - reminders of what’s in my head
        - goal is to get them out of my head
    - literature notes
        - write down what you want to remember  
        - excerpts from the text - be selective
        - the point is understanding the meaning
    - permanent notes
        - go back over "fleeting notes" and "literature notes"
        - think  about how they relate to other things i’m thinking about
            - contradict
            - support
            - add to
            - combine with?
        - one note per idea
        - try to develop ideas, not just collect them
    - throw away fleeting notes and literature notes go into reference storage
    - connect permenant notes to other notes 
    - when exploring ideas, jump back  into the slip box  and follow  lines of thought
        - this is basically what we’re doing when [[brainstorming]], but we do it outside of brains
            - this probably lets me be more surprised and stops me from falling into patterns and habits
    - develop ideas until you’ve got a topic to write about
    - assemble them into an argument
        - see where there are holes
        - adjust the argument or fill in the holes
    - proofread the draft
    - work on many ideas at once
        - they system will take care of the multitasking
            - engaging my brain in thinking about multiple things (without having to remember them) will allow it to draw new, connections #serendipity
    - make sure to carve out time to play in the slip box.
        - it doesn’t have to have a goal (in fact it’s probably better if it doesn’t)
        - it just have to be fun
- "[[Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have]]"
    - Focus the problem. Just the essential parts, strip away instead of building up
    - The purpose of any good product or technique is to fade into the background in service of the __actual__ task
        - in this case, thinking
        - good [[design]] is unobtrusive
    - when you have the thought, the goal is to capture a reminder of the thought, not neccessarily the thought itself
        - trust the system
        - i don’t have to get it all out
