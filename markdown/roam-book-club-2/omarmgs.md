    - [[Introduction]]
        - Thinking is strongly founded in #writing, and writing is the foundation of #research, #learning and #studying, so if we want to improve our writing we need to improve our #notes.
        - #note-taking is a way to avoid starts with a #[[blank page]], and show us that #myths like #[["writing has to be difficult"]], #[["Some people are just like that"]] or #[["the struggle is part of the deal]] are only bad approximations to #writing, it's so much easier to start with you have written before, and this make our writing more productive and even help us to deliver a superior #[[quality of a paper]]. 
        - #note-taking requires #habits, puts our confidence in #willpower makes us fail and lose our #[[self-control]] and #[[self-discipline]], which depend more on the #[[environment]] than ourselves, #success is based on #[[well-defined]] and meaningful #tasks that conciliate our #[[short-term interests]] and our #[[long-term interests]]
        - “One cannot think without writing.” (Luhmann 1992, 53) ([Location 57](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=57))

        - Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work. ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=134))
            - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
        - There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly. ([Location 139](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=139))

        - “Some people are just like that,” “writing has to be difficult,” “the struggle is part of the deal” are just a few of the mantras that keep too many from inquiring what exactly distinguishes successful writing strategies from less successful ones.

            - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
        - That is why good, productive writing is based on good note-taking. Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there.

        - The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=158))

        - failure. What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004).

        - It is not so important who you are, but what you do. Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, to success. ([Location 169](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=169))

        - Willpower is, as far as we know today,[2] a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term (Baumeister, Bratslavsky, Muraven, and Tice, 1998; Muraven, Tice, and Baumeister, 1998; Schmeichel, Vohs, and Baumeister, 2003; Moller, 2006).

        - Even if you don’t aim to develop a grand theory and just want to keep track of what you read, organise your notes and develop your thoughts, you will have to deal with an increasingly complex body of content, especially because it is not just about collecting thoughts, but about making connections and sparking new ideas.

        - The importance of an overarching workflow is the great insight of David Allen’s “Getting Things Done” (Allen, 2001). ([Location 272](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=272))

        - The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. ([Location 274](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=274))

        - Allen calls a “mind like water” - the state where we can focus on the work right in front of us without getting distracted by competing thoughts. ([Location 278](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=278))
            - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
        - David Allen’s technique cannot simply be transferred to the task of insightful writing. The first reason is that GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition.

            - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
        - We usually start with rather vague ideas that are bound to change until they become clearer in the course of our research (cf. Ahrens, 2014, 134f.). ([Location 283](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=284))
            - **Tags**: #[[pink]]
        - The other reason is that GTD requires projects to be broken down into smaller, concrete “next steps.” Of course, insightful writing or academic work is also done one step at a time, but these are most often too small to be worth writing down (looking up a footnote, rereading a chapter, writing a paragraph) or too grand to be finished in one go.

        - if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just can’t be compensated by a high IQ.

        - Adding a note directly behind another note is only one way of doing this. Another way is by adding a link on this and/or the other note, which could be anywhere in the system. This very much resembles, of course, the way we use hyperlinks on the internet. But, as I will explain later, they are quite different and it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique. ([Location 442](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=442))
