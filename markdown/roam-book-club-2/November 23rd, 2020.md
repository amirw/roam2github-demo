- #Question-for [[Mike Kramer]] - Mike, is your powerpoint posted anywhere?  I'd like to at least have a list of what you suggested for a Zettle (not for the bookclub exercise but for future).   Thanks, [[Denise Todd]]
    - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]] Hi Denise. I just went into the file and, bizarrely, only the first few slides are still there. The rest are gone. 
        - The main idea was that someday our databases will get very large, so simple searches or tags won't be sufficient for retrieving what we want.
        - So, we need to create entry points. We do that by creating Zettels that contain within them clusters of other Zettels, and that very clearly state what the relationships among those component Zettels are.
- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"What is holding you back from creating zettels?"
    1. #Reply-from[[[Yingyue Liu]]I am very passionate about creating zettels. One thing that holds me back is the fatigue after finishing reading. I would detach from the reading for a while. This helps me to come up with better writing but at the same time, I might also lose the rhythm and end up with not writing at all.
        - So one coping strategy for me is schedule the zettel-writing time before I switch to other tasks. Also, setting the right detachment period helps to keep the rhythm and flow.
    2. #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] I love this question because it gets at something I think is really important - a kind of existential anxiety that always surfaces in writing around the question "is __this__ particular thing important enough to write about, really?"
        - For me it's a little like staring down at a slope of powder and realizing that once you push off onto your skis, you'll be leaving a path - so ... WHICH path? the choice can feel momentous
        - I think in the end there is just a moment of faith where we realize we just have to follow our instinct about what is important to say, and to remember. the trails we are carving in the snow.
        - The other piece I think is that really, we've been zettelling all along, perhaps without writing it down, in the process of arriving at our own strongly held, conscious OR subconscious beliefs about the world
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] Yes! And to be able to watch those ideas grow and expand, change and evolve over time, cupped by the evidence that the `Literature` and `Fleeting` notes provide is amazing!
                - I think there's a huge misconception of this whole process, and just like people in recovery always state, we are just doing what we already knew how to do
        - So maybe part of the existential anxiety comes from realizing that once we start to write those beliefs down, some of them might not hold up to scrutiny as well as we thought ... 
        - Either way the antidote is the same - I think finally, we just have to jump in a do it! 
        - Let the process teach us whatever it is we need to know. 
        - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]]It's great to have you back Matt! I like what you are saying about playing with the system. Make it fun and learning becomes so much easier.
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] Fun > Everything... The system disappears, and then it's just all about what I'm thinking, and what I'm writing... Love it~
            - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] thanks Mike! and 100% agree Beau, enjoyment is crucial

    - Not sure if this is the right place to put this so feel free to correct me if I'm doing it wrong :).
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] If you put your name after the `#Chat` then it will color in your name, showing you whether you're working in accordance with the conventions or not
    - Some questions around "zettling" and permanent notes that I've come up with over the past days and weeks:
        - #Question    Should you tag and link text, concepts or keywords directly within quotes or highlights? (e.g. from within the "raw" text of the book(s) or only from within your own notes) 
        - #Question    Can permanent notes/evergreen notes be stated as questions, rather than statements or ideas?
        - #Question   When do you upgrade a fleeting note to a Zettel right away?
    - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]]
        - Hi Philip. These are insightful questions. Here are my thoughts:
            - "#Question    Should you tag and link text, concepts or keywords directly within quotes or highlights? (e.g. from within the "raw" text of the book(s) or only from within your own notes) "
                - All the accomplished zettlers that I know of see their goal as the creation of permanent notes and the creation of links among those notes. Therefore, quotes and highlights are seen, primarily, as steppingstones to permanent notes, __not__ ends in themselves.
So, I focus on tagging and linking not in quotes or highlights, but in permanent notes.
                    - #Reply-from [[Philip Skogsberg]]
                        - Maybe it's just the FOMO of note-taking that sets in - the collector's fallacy if you will - but I find it satisfying to tag my highlights sometimes in case they might pop-up again in some other circumstance or might prove useful to me in the future if I stumble across them while reading or looking for something else. On the other hand, perhaps that's just short-cutting the smart note-taking approach - without having done the work of creating your own permanent notes (not they are mutually exclusive, though).
            - "#Question    Can permanent notes/evergreen notes be stated as questions, rather than statements or ideas?"
                - I agree strongly with [[Matt McKinlay]]'s recommendation at the live session [[November 22nd, 2020]]. He suggested that we make our zettels be declarative statements. [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]] appears to state that a question can be a zettel in his book, but usinig [[Roam]], if I have a question, I prefer to make it a TODO.
                    - Note that sometimes, when writing, you might want to use a note that says: "In the year 1906 Messerschmidt was obsessed with investigating the answer to the question, 'What is the perd of the snalf'?" But this note is a declarative statement that happens to contain a question.
                        - #Reply-from [[Philip Skogsberg]]
                            - SÃ¶nke talks a lot about having questions and topics of interests that you pursue, letting them guide your reading, note-taking and writing. As you read and write, new questions often emerge as sort of "open questions" that may or may not get answered. Would you recommend to keep a record or these questions by writing them as fleeting notes, for example? Tagging them in connection to reading notes, etc?
                                - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]] I like all of your suggestions. Before I write permanent notes I find it very helpful to write down questions and confusions. 
            - "#Question   When do you upgrade a fleeting note to a Zettel right away?"
                - Let's say I just got an idea. It could have been prompted by a conversation, listening to a podcast, reading a book or article, or something else. 
                    - If the idea is still vague and inchoate, I would jot down a fleeting note.
                    - If my idea is the idea expressed by the text, but in my own words, I have a choice:
                        - I might make it a literature note, because I think that it needs some more time to incubate, or
                            - #Reply-from [[Philip Skogsberg]]
                                - This reminds me of a related #Question 
                                    - How do you deal with literature notes that are "incubated", e.g. you've taken some notes from a source but you're not ready to create permanent notes yet, you want to let it marinate for a while. What's your process for coming back to these notes, especially if you have notes from multiple books, articles or sources?
                        - I might think that this idea is truly important and go straight to writing a permanent note, without passing through a fleeting or literature note. I would, however, cite my source in the permanent note.
                - The majority of my fleeting notes and literature notes __never__ become Zettels. And, sometimes, I go directly from reading a text to creating a Zettel, without ever creating a fleeting note or permanent note. 
                    - I know it sounds kind of touchy-feely, but just play around with this stuff until you find a workflow that you are comfortable with. Some texts are really complex and packed with great ideas. Others are mostly fluff. Everything is always relative to your interests and goals. 
- #Question  [[Jason Kleinberg ðŸŽ»]]  Would you make a permanent note from a single source? Or would you want to refer to at least one other source before making a permanent note?
    - I ask because I (along with other folks) have only made literature notes on [[How To Take Smart Notes]].
        - #Reply-from [[Philip Skogsberg]]
            - I do this quite often. Ideally you want [[Permanent notes]] to be like amalgamations of various ideas that you've sort of made your own. But a good way to start with Smart note-writing, in my opinion, is to just remix other's ideas in your own words - if you think the idea is strong enough to make it into your [[Zettelkasten]] - from a single source. As you can keep on reading and writing more, your first Zettels will eventually become inspiration for further ideas, perhaps referencing multiple sources.
