- #Announcement [[Beau Haan 📌]]

1) Was lucky enough to be there for [[Mika Mauger]]'s first `Zettel` → keep an eye on this young-gun, he's about to change the world! Proud of 'ya! #Bravo

2) Long chat with [[Chinarut]] and we distilled a beautifully worded `Zettel`!!!

3) Watching [[Ashish]] lean back in his chair, filled with insight after creating his `Zettel` nearly brought tears to my eyes... that's why I do this! Thank you, [[Ashish]]!

4) Gotcha! [[Christopher Boone]]!!! What a wild journey that was creating your first `Zettel`! You're doing great~

5) I learned what "Grok" meant today, thanks [[Henry Finkelstein]]! You're ability to craft `Fleeting` and `Literature` and `Zettels` is phenomenal!

6) [[Rahul Prakash]] It was a pleasure walking through with you in creating your first `Zettel`! #Output 
    - "For me, the work part was more abstract than the physics part"
    - #Question from [[Denise Todd]] If you have a Zettle with only one literature note as a reference (and by definition the source for that literature note) How is that Zettle any different from any other literature note.  I keep thinking that a Zettle should be an 'evolved" thought based on the book and other things - not just one book.  Thoughts? 
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] As the one exception, the very first `Zettel` is the only note that is created outside of the conversation within the [[Zettelkasten]]
            - Each subsequent `Zettel` is contextually connected to the previous `Zettel` in location of where it is placed in the nested-sequence
            - But the location of where it is placed is irrelevant, since the `Relevant Notes` connecting all of the `Zettels` is where the magic happens after a critical mass is accumulated, as the conversations branch off into disparate thought trails

- #Chat [[Beau Haan 📌]] I've realized from these 1-on-1 Coaching Sessions, just how powerful [[Roam]] can be, if utilized in the way that [[Roam]] works when creating a [[Zettelkasten]]
    - I say that, because the format that everyone is typically using is one directly copying the analog format, forgetting that in this digital realm we have crucially distinctive technologies that aid in ways that [[Niklas Luhmann]] could only have dreamt about
        - Blocks $$>$$ Page, but a Block also acts as a $$=$$ Page in [[Roam]]
    - If I wanted to copy-paste the analog shoebox into this digital format, I would much rather simply use the physical slip-box to organize my notes
        - And I say that, because at least then I could see the creases, coffee stains, and dog-ears left from actual physical usage
        - If we can have robust `Fleeting` notes, since we don't have to worry about a mountain of index cards piling on our desk, and we can have multiple lines of `Literature` notes to fully encapsulate what we have synthesized from the text, and then to also have the actual source to the side... then the workflow for the creation of a `Zettelkasten` is perfectly suited for this note-taking tool for networked thought... IMO #RoamLove
- #Question[[Mike Kramer]] Could this explain the effectiveness of the Zettelkasten method?
    - "Cognitive scientists agree that learning is connecting new knowledge to previously existing knowledge." 
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] So before I add a new `Zettel` to my already existing nested-sequence of permanent notes, I am __connecting__ this new knowledge to my previously existing knowledge through nesting AND also adding `Relevant Notes` to this new `Zettel` __connecting__ them together
