- #[[Observation üëÅ]] [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]]  As I start to take smart notes, I'm noticing that I work more slowly.
    - However, I suspect that in the long run, I'll learn more quickly.
    - More importantly, this time spent learning will not have been wasted.
    - I've already noticed that my memory has improved, even for trivial things which I'm not trying to remember.
    - I'm starting to feel a pleasant, gulp, __faith__ in the Zettelkasten process. 
        - Though this is taking a lot of time right now, I have faith that my other work will get done in a more productive, interesting and enjoyable fashion.
- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"Does it matter if you don't take notes on a book?"
    1. [[Mike Kramer]]It makes a difference if you take linked notes on a book. The underlying assumption is that your overarching goal is to write texts. If, as you are reading a book, you create linked notes, you are doing a bit of writing whenever you are reading. If you do not create linked notes as you read, when it comes time to write, you are faced with a blank page or a blank screen. You must then take all your written notes (or unwritten ideas) and link them.
        - Recommended procedure:
            - Read, note, link. Read, note, link. Read, note, link. 
                - this is more like [spaced practice](https://www.moedu-sail.org/portfolio-items/spaced-vs-massed-practice/#:~:text=Massed%20Practice%20refers%20to%20conditions,intervals%20within%20the%20practice%20sessions.)
        - Ineffective procedure:
            - Read, read, read. Note, note, note. Link, link, link.
                - this is more like [massed practice](https://www.moedu-sail.org/portfolio-items/spaced-vs-massed-practice/#:~:text=Massed%20Practice%20refers%20to%20conditions,intervals%20within%20the%20practice%20sessions.)
                    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] üëÜüèº He's right you know~
                    - #Reply [[Jim Stanczak]] - May I ask a clarifying question? You mean don't read three consecutive books and then try and batch process them, but something like progressive summarization is ok? So I read a book one week, review my highlights to create literature notes, and then take another pass to create literature notes? Thanks!
                        - #Reply[[Mike Kramer]] It all depends on how dense the book is that you are reading. But your strategy is fine.
    2. [[Denise Todd]] It makes no difference at all if your objective is pure entertainment.  But if your intention is to learn, grow or challenge yourself, then it is crucial to take notes. 
- #Chat [[Beau Haan üìå]] After today's live session, I feel like there's still a lot of confusion of even starting, so for this week's [[Meetup]] I'm thinking of changing the format and opening it up to just a simple Q&A structure
    - Maybe even starting a list of questions to discuss and then allowing for a more detailed answering of how to essentially get started with [[Zettelkasten]] in [[Roam]]

(Add your questions below)

        - [[Denise Todd]] Thanks, Beau!  This will be a great help. Please post the day and time of the next meetup (I didn't see on the [[Meetup]] page ) 
How to best structure your notes in Roam?  Should fleeting notes be on the same page - with source above or below?  
        - [[Denise Todd]]Should literature notes be split by major topic as suggested in the article below
            - "RoamBrain published an article about [[Zettelkasten in Roam]] titled [Implementing Zettelkasten in Roam: A practical guide](https://www.roambrain.com/implementing-zettelkasten-in-roam/), written by [[zakk]] [[November 15th, 2020]]"
        - [[Denise Todd]]What are the pros and cons of categorizing permanent notes in the title as [[Beau Haan]] had suggested?  Can I assume that one perm note could be in multiple categories?  
            - "![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FeA-cYPLkdc.png?alt=media&token=40a0b856-69b9-4c34-9e42-7103d0a9d61f)"
        - [[Denise Todd]] What are the benefits of using a "/" in the title of pages? For example, I've seen "Book/Title."  I think I saw somewhere you could do a CTRL combination that would switch that from "Book/Title" to "B/Title" or did I make that up? 
            - #Reply-from[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] the "namespacing convention" as it is sometimes called is mostly aesthetic, it doesn't always function the way you might want ... so I don't think its use is that widespread. 

But it has at least a few small aesthetic uses. 

For example my name on this site ([[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]) is namespaced so if you turn on namespace abbreviation (the feature you can find in the three-dot menu, top right, under "User Settings" then you can cycle through different display options, for namespaced page titles )
                - #in-reply-to [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] Thanks, Matt!  Exactly what I was looking for.  
        - [[Justin Pledger]] Did anyone respond to [[Denise Todd]] about the / in the title? I'm quite keen to know. I am using B: to denote a book and A: to denote an article etc. However, if using Book/Title is better than it'd be good to know now! :) Thank you!

        - Just a note - I did not #[[Quick Capture]] this.  The graph wanted to sync when I went in.  This Quick Capture not actually belongs to someone else.
