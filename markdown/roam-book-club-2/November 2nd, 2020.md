            - [here is the link](https://catominor3.medium.com/latex-for-roam-from-non-math-perspective-d86fd0a2a9c2)
                - [[Latham Turner]] this is really cool.  Thanks [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]!
    - update 07:32AM PST
    - the sync finally went through
    - I had to do a hard refresh (the circley arrow thing next to the search window in the browser)
    - once I did that, sync happened at a snail pace (took 15 minutes or so)
    - now my light is green again
    - just memorializing this here in case anyone else is having "sync" problems (i.e. what you are typing might not be showing up in the main database if your sync light at the upper right is persistently orange)
    - thanks [[@Lindsey Johnston‚ú®]] for helping me troubleshoot this!

    - #Chat [[Jeremie Rykner]] Yes me 2 [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] I had 280 pending changes, which took hours, and only finished updating  1 hour ago 17:41 GMT+2  Looks like the multiplayer was heavy on the servers
- #chat [[Tracy Winchell]] Spent 40 minutes this morning on the book. 20 minutes reading and highlighting, then another 20 minutes taking notes on highlights using #ReadWise. I suppose what I'll do Saturday or Sunday is do an import from Readwise into my graph, then replicate the most pertinent notes into the public graph -- at which point they're probably not fleeting notes anymore. üòÇ 
    - [[Ramses Oudt]] -- you got any insights into this workflow?
- [[Kara Monroe]]
    - [[Goals for Book Club]]
        - I'm writing a class on note taking - its history, the how to, why we do it, technology and tips. I would like to incorporate learning from this book club experience into the course. I plan to release the course on [[January 1st, 2021]]
        - I would also like to improve my own [[Zettelkasten]] method; specifically from both a digital workflow perspective (i.e. [[ReadWise]] to [[Roam]] and then publishing to [[Notion]] web page and my [[Substack]] newsletter)
        - I was unable to participate in Session 1 due to another activity. I do want to participate in all three remaining sessions and be an active member of this graph.
- #Chat [[Beau Haan üìå]] - Links to [[Zettelkasten]] resources, tips for a smoother experience, and link to this Wednesday's [[Meetup]]
    - ### Some links that have helped me on this journey

    - ### Tips to make this [[Multiplayer Roam]] experience a little smoother
        1. When editing a block click the parent bullet-point to focus on that block, which prevents the whole page from shifting when others are editing a different block on the same page
            - #Tutorial ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FW-iD3v6xVe.gif?alt=media&token=92ffc6b0-59a0-4f5a-a462-5a200c05da92)
        2. Click on the __calendar icon__ located near the top-right, to see `Tomorrow`'s [[Daily Notes]] since everyone's view is dependent on their location, so some people will be a day ahead. This is great if you want to read more of other's notes
        3. Right-click on a bullet and switch to __View as Numbered List__ if you want to break up the monotony of bulleted blocks
            - video soon~
        4. Learn the power of nesting, since how things are displayed will vary depending on how they are indented. This is especially interesting when you block reference and you __Click on references__

    - [[Dan Allosso]] I‚Äôm curious also how [[Roam Research]] fits into an ecosystem of research, note-taking, and writing apps for other people? I‚Äôm about 3 weeks into my exploration of this app. Have been using [[Hypothes.is]] for social annotation myself and with my students. [[Zotero]] for research. I‚Äôve been agnostic with students on apps (some still use paper cards pretty effectively). Thinking for my own purposes of using this app in combination with some others rather than as the place I jam everything.
        - #Reply [[Tony Tong]] #@ [[Dan Allosso]]
            - One objective benefit of using [[Roam Research]] and its [[roam/js]] extensions is that it saves time with many possible automation. And this benefit will be more obvious when [[Roam/API]] is released.

    - My notes on [[Chapter 5. Writing is the Only Thing That Matters]]
        - "This book is based on another assumption: Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research. Nobody starts from scratch and everybody is already able to think for themselves. Studying, done properly, is research, because it is about gaining insight that cannot be anticipated and will be shared within the scientific community under public scrutiny. There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas."
            - Any reading, enquiry, is research - it should be linked with documenting your contemporaneous reflections and insights and, in theory, you could have a unique, unanticipated insight that is an addition to collective human knowledge.
                - But how can I have an insight that nobody else would have? Because I have a unique collection of knowledge and this engages with what I am reading/studying.
                - Does this also mean that if everyone wrote down their reflections as they studied/read/researched and we could somehow bounce all these ideas around we'd just figure out the meaning of life like that?
        - "School is different. Pupils are usually not encouraged to follow their own learning paths, question and discuss everything the teacher is teaching and move on to another topic if something does not promise to generate interesting insight. The teacher is there for the pupils to learn. But, as Wilhelm von Humboldt, founder of the Humboldt University of Berlin and brother to the great explorer Alexander von Humboldt, put it, the professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter. Everything within the university aims at some kind of publication. A written piece does not necessarily need to be accepted in an international journal to become public. In fact, the vast majority of what is written and discussed is not published in this narrow sense. The review process itself is a form of presenting an idea publicly to the peers and so is everything a student hands over to a professor or lecturer. Even the handout for a presentation discussed with fellow students is a written piece made public. It is public because in the discussion, it does not matter anymore what the author meant, only what is there in writing. The moment the author can be removed from the scene, the written piece is a public claim on truth. The criteria for a convincing argument are always the same, regardless of who the author is or the status of the publisher: They have to be coherent and based on facts. Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. This is why the presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin (Peters and Sch√§fer 2006, 9). "
            - The presentation of knowledge is synchronous with the production of knowledge - we arrive at truth (produce knowledge) by writing, by deliberating, by talking about what we think we know and making arguments.
            - I also love the idea that the author is left out and the argument has to stand on its own, I wish that this were the way things were done in public. 
        - "Focusing on writing as if nothing else counts does not necessarily mean you should do everything else less well, but it certainly makes you do everything else differently. Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus. You will not waste your time with the attempt to figure out what you ‚Äúshould‚Äù learn. Rather, you will try to learn as efficiently as possible so you can quickly get to the point where actual open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about. You quickly learn to distinguish good-sounding arguments from actual good ones, as you will have to think them through whenever you try to write them down and connect them with your previous knowledge. It will change the way you read as well: You will become more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannot write down everything. You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don‚Äôt understand what it is about. By doing this, you will elaborate on the meaning, which will make it much more likely that you will remember it. You also have to think beyond the things you read, because you need to turn it into something new. And by doing everything with the clear purpose of writing about it, you will do what you do deliberately. Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008). If you change your mind about the importance of writing, you will also change your mind about everything else. Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing."
            - Actual open questions are the only questions worth writing about.
                - I don't fully agree with this - I think "insight" can also mean answering a closed question in a more elegant or clear way or helping to make the answer more contemporary or relatable.
            - When you try to write down a bad argument, you realise it is bad because it doesn't make sense + it contradicts your previous knowledge. 
            - Read differently because a pre-condition of #translation is #understanding. If you don't understand you will know this.
                - This has been my experience although it hasn't necessarily helped me to understand more.
            - "...nothing counts other than writing". 
    - My notes on [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
        - "In hindsight, we know why they failed: The ship owners tried to integrate the container into their usual way of working without changing the infrastructure and their routines. They tried to benefit from the obvious simplicity of loading containers onto ships without letting go of what they were used to. In the beginning, the perception was very much shaped by what worked before, and only the most immediate effects were visible. The ship owners looked at the bags and crates of goods and wondered why they should pack them a second time into another box. They were glad when they unloaded their goods at the harbour and they were eager to move on. They wondered why they should go container-hunting instead. They looked at the ships they had and wondered how to fit containers into them. McLean understood better than others that it is not the perspective of the ship-owners that counts, but the purpose of the whole trade: to bring goods from the producer to the final destination. Only after aligning every single part of the delivery chain, from packaging to delivery, from the design of the ships to the design of the harbours, was the full potential of the container unleashed."
            - An interesting analogy here with genetic evolution: #complexity arises from lots of simple mutations that each create a benefit on their own eventually working together, and this requires each simple mutation to be ubiquitous before the next step happens.
            - Interesting point overall that wholesale commitment to shipping containers was a break-through but partial commitment had many disadvantages without realising the advantages.
        - "In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? Most students sort their material by topic or even by seminars and semester. From the perspective of someone who writes, that makes as much sense as sorting your errands by purchase date and the store they were bought from. Can‚Äôt find your trousers? Maybe they are with the bleach you bought the same day at your department store."
            - Try to anticipate future self and discovery, although this seems like a lot of effort. Then again, I wish my past self had done this better.
            - Also a great idea to tag individual notes.
        - "1. Fleeting notes, which are only reminders of information, can be written in any kind of way and will end up in the trash within a day or two."
            - Like a passing thought, not important to keep them, they come and go.
        - "2. Permanent notes, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in themselves in a permanently understandable way. They are always stored in the same way in the same place, either in the reference system or, written as if for print, in the slip-box."
            - Has enough context that I could read it and make sense of it without having to remember the background, or, indeed, someone else could read i.t
        - "A typical mistake is made by many diligent students who are adhering to the advice to keep a scientific journal. A friend of mine does not let any idea, interesting finding or quote he stumbles upon dwindle away and writes everything down. He always carries a notebook with him and often makes a few quick notes during a conversation. The advantage is obvious: No idea ever gets lost. The disadvantages are serious, though: As he treats every note as if it belongs to the ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù category, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. On top of that, the strict chronological order does not offer any help to find, combine or rearrange ideas in a productive sense. It is not surprising that my friend has a bookshelf filled with notebooks full of wonderful ideas, but not a single publication to show."
            - What makes it so good is the notes you DON"T keep (like that john west tuna). It's not about writing everything down, it's about writing many things down and then discarding some. 
        - "What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. More notes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring related ones together in a playful way. But it should be just the opposite: The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones‚Äìand the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort."
            - In an ideal system, there is a '[[network effect]]' to note-taking so that each note increases the value of the system as a whole. In contrast, other methods have a 'dis-economy of scale'. 
        - "It is important to reflect on the purpose of these different types of notes. Fleeting notes are there for capturing ideas quickly while you are busy doing something else. When you are in a conversation, listening to a lecture, hear something noteworthy or an idea pops into your mind while you are running errands, a quick note is the best you can do without interrupting what you are in the middle of doing. That might even apply to reading, if you want to focus on a text without interrupting your reading flow. Then you might want to just underline sentences or write short comments in the margins. It is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. They will very soon become completely useless‚Äìunless you do something with them. If you already know that you will not go back to them, don‚Äôt take these kind of notes in the first place. Take proper notes instead. Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later. Fleeting literature notes can make sense if you need an extra step to understand or grasp an idea, but they will not help you in the later stages of the writing process, as no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument. These kinds of notes are just reminders of a thought, which you haven‚Äôt had the time to elaborate on yet. Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from."
            - Fleeting notes are like picking basil leaves - you need to use them quickly or they will spoil and be useless. You need to convert them into pesto and then freeze it (ie make permanent notes). It's fine to pick the basil leaves but you do have to use them.
                - [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] #Chat I love this analogy, and ive realised that ive been trying to make frozen pesto from the start- rather than picking the basil leaves, converting them into pesto and then freezing them...Basically i don't write fleeting notes, what ive written as "fleeting notes", are actually way too detailed and developed. 
        - "Most ideas will not stand the test of time, while others might become the seed for a major project. Unfortunately, they are not easy to distinguish right away. That is why the threshold to write an idea down has to be as low as possible, but it is equally crucial to elaborate on them within a day or two. A good indication that a note has been left unprocessed too long is when you no longer understand what you meant or it appears banal. In the first case, you forgot what it was supposed to remind you of. In the second case, you forgot the context that gave it its meaning."
            - Make time every day or two to go through fleeting notes and turn them into permanent notes WOW.
        - "The only permanently stored notes are the literature notes in the reference system and the main notes in the slip-box. The former can be very brief as the context is clearly the text they refer to. The latter need be written with more care and details as they need to be self-explanatory. Luhmann never underlined sentences in the text he read or wrote comments in the margins. All he did was take brief notes about the ideas that caught his attention in a text on a separate piece of paper: ‚ÄúI make a note with the bibliographic details. On the backside I would write ‚Äòon page x is this, on page y is that,‚Äô and then it goes into the bibliographic slip-box where I collect everything I read.‚Äù (Hagen, 1997)[ 13] But before he stored them away, he would read what he noted down during the day, think about its relevance for his own lines of thought and write about it, filling his main slip-box with permanent notes. Nothing in this box would ever get thrown away. Some notes might disappear into the background and never catch his attention again, while others might become connection points to various lines of reasoning and reappear on a regular basis in various contexts."
            - No underlining or comments in margins - only synthesis and translation.
        - "As it is not possible to foresee the development of the slip-box, the fate of the notes is nothing to worry about. In contrast to the fleeting notes, every permanent note for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece, but that can not be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments. The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference."
            - Write everything as if it may be used in the future, devoid of context - they are fully ready to go. "Frozen pizza".

    - "[[Goals for Book Club]]My goal is to learn a method for accessing and expanding thoughts I have which are inspired by and generated from my reading, in a way that results in a constantly evolving coherent world view, and to easily produce writing that can be shared. I want to leave a record of what it felt like, how it was to be me, living in the time and place that I have lived, thinking the thoughts that I have thought. I believe my thoughts and feelings are a unique experience God is having of himself, and therefore it is my responsibility to intensify and interiorize them as much as possible. I believe it is also the case that I do not exist apart from others and the world, so that it is also my responsibility to continually communicate what it is to experience existence as myself, whatever that is."

I‚Äôm still evolving my thinking (been using the app for three weeks) about how I‚Äôm using [[Roam Research]] in my research ecosystem of apps. Was thinking I might try to make it my [[Slipbox]] rather than a depository for notes, which I might continue keeping in MarginNote3 and Evernote and then migrate here as slightly more digested paraphrases. Still thinking about it, though. 
                - [[Mike Kramer]] My thinking aligns with yours. Quotation should be avoided whenever possible for the very reasons [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] gave. It takes more effort in the short-term to paraphrase but the point that I drew was that it increases my productivity in the longer-term.
                    - [[Tony Tong]] [[@Mike Kramer]] Could you point me to where [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] listed the reasons?
                        - [[Dan Allosso]] to [[@Tony Tong]]: Section 1.3, page 19: ‚ÄúHe did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another.‚Äù I‚Äôm still getting used to the idea of block quotes, but I‚Äôll consider that option. 
                - [[Tony Tong]] [[@[[Dan Allosso]]]] [[@Mike Kramer]] but quoting by [[block reference]] can make enrich the graph with more links between notes and ideas. I agree with paraphrasing rather than quoting though. So paraphrasing + [[block reference]] could be the way to go.

    - [[Conventions]]; #Chat
        - Should there be some convention on whether tags should start with a capital or not? I'm already seeing a lot of duplicates popping up, which would prevent people from getting an overview of everything that's been written on a subject. E.g. [[conventions]] vs [[Conventions]] and #Chat vs #Chat.
            - I see it's even worse for tags with multiple nouns: [[Fleeting Notes]] vs [[Fleeting Notes]] vs [[Fleeting Notes]]
            - yes [[@Thomas B.]] this was an issue with v 1.0 of book club for sure
            - I like to have a strict lower-case rule UNLESS it's a proper noun
                - Eeek~ my proclivity is to have upper-case, since I turn off brackets (`Ctrl-C, Ctrl-B`) and I want to see the links clearer
                - I will also add that some CSS rules are case-sensitive as in the case of `Chat` and `chat`
                - #Reply [[Brandon Toner]] I use the same model: lowercase unless it's a proper noun for pages. I'm more inconsistent on tags and attributes. I need a more unifying model there. [[@[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]]
            - but maybe we should see if there's a group consensus on that
            - [[@Thomas B.]] It seems that [[alias]] can help here
        - [[Charles Farr]] #in-response-to [[@Thomas B.]]
            - During the last book club we ran into similar problems. I think that ultimately we need to also establish conventions that allow for some users to moderate page names and collapse pages
            - It's very easy to collapse the three examples here into one single page, but it takes some level of manual effort: "I see it's even worse for tags with multiple nouns: [[Fleeting Notes]] vs [[Fleeting Notes]] vs [[Fleeting Notes]]"
            - Would be awesome to have a widget / js script that surfaces all of the similarly named pages!

- [[Alex Shchedrin]]
    - Just added my fleeting notes on the introduction. The HUGE difference between BC2 and BC1 is that we have the book in the graph. Being able to see fleeting notes and comments inline on blocks is incredible! It is a completely new way to experience a book. 
    - Indeed [[Alex Shchedrin]]. [[Collective reading]] with Roam is a mind-altering experience, like reading a sci-fi book and then discovering you've fallen into that world.

    - May I request a page for additional resources re: Zettelkasten and related topics? 
        - "#Chat [[Beau Haan üìå]] - Links to [[Zettelkasten]] resources, tips for a smoother experience, and link to this Wednesday's [[Meetup]]"
    - Also is there a brief video orienting us to how to use chat within Roam?
