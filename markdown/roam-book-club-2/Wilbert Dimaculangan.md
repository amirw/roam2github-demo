        - the book is about creating a workflow specific to writing and notetaking [*](((59-bYYcu-)))
        - Structure will make writing simpler [*](((N9B8GYzJr)))
            - This reminds me of a [video by Ted Ed on [[creative constraints]]] 
                - {{[[youtube]]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5FL9VTBZzQ}}
            - Less time looking for the input and producing the output (i.e. either a [[Digital Garden]] or a published work)
        - The Problem is not the topics we want to write but the difficulty of having a consistent writing routine [*](((lz_jy3Uyg)))There is a difference between having structure and having a plan or plans of something [*](((e5t8EGtoY))
        - There is a difference between having structure and having a plan or plans of something [*](((e5t8EGtoY)))
            - Planning should be avoided in writing

                - necessitates the use of [[willpower]] 
                - Assumes that insight can be generated out of thin air
                    - Insights are generated from a state of distraction (see David Perell 3Blue1Brown podcast episode)
