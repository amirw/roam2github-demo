    - {{[[DONE]]}} [[Introduction]]
        - Query
        - Writing is foundational to intellectual endeavors [*](((hG7TRPF5I)))
        - Within the pantheon of writing, most attention is paid to lengthy written pieces, with the art of notetaking sorely neglected [*](((PGX-Y4f9Y)))
        - Traditional writing strategy focus on solving the "blank-page problem" — How To Take Smart Notes takes an inverse approach, emphasizing the note as the main unit of writing [*](((baDCUDIxD)))
            - The prevalence of these ideas has led to a belief that surmounting the blank-page problem is fundamental to the writing experience. However, the contrary is true — if you're starting with a blank page, you're writing in the wrong way [*](((VQiKWP6bz)))
        - To become a better writer — producing written pieces more easily and exploring more interesting topics & questions — **requires daily work** in the practice of note-taking [*](((KqvBsDubC)))
    - {{[[DONE]]}} [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - [[Fleeting Notes]] Maintaining a Zettelkasten requires significant effort and building a habit around note-taking. 
            - “I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.” [*](((59-bYYcu-)))
        - [[Everything You Need To Know]]
            - Establishes a strong workflow built on sound structure allows you to trust your note-taking process and thereby focus on "the content, the argument, & the ideas" instead of focusing on the need to hold "everything together in your head." [*](((N9B8GYzJr)))
            - Research must occur within a structure, but should not follow a strict plan. [*](((e5t8EGtoY)))
                - Following a strict plan restricts one's ability to follow insight.
                - Building an overarching structure & workflow allows a researcher to adjust their exploration to follow [[lines of inquiry]] as they emerge.
            - Within this structured approach to research (relying on a workflow instead of a plan), "peeking over the fences of your own discipline" is critical for exposing oneself to different ideas and identifying new and interesting research questions. [*](((GgF6t07Z4)))
            - Poor students often feel more successful than their better performing peers because they do not have a good view of what they do not know. [*](((LTX79DEgy)))
                - This is known as the [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]].
                - By confining themselves neatly to their discipline and reading only what is required, poor students find it very easy to complete what is asked of them.
            - Good students work to look beyond their discipline and identify questions they cannot answer and entire disciplines they no nothing about. [*](((Y0L49bjII)))
                - Good students focus on their [[anti-library]] — the sum total of works they have yet to collect and the knowledge they have yet to come by.
                - A result of an understanding on one's [[anti-knowledge]] can lead to [[Imposter Syndrome]]
        - [[1.1 Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected]]
            - Implementing a [[Zettelkasten]] and adding to it over time results in an increasingly complex structure. Maintaining a simple workflow is the best way to combat this. [*](((vhg4vhrk2)))
                - While appealing, overlaying additional structures can lead to silos. Focus on applying the core tenants of the workflow and **establishing new connections** instead of new hierarchies. [*](((FfwvQnsGs)))
            - #quote Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly (cf. Mata, Todd, and Lippke, 2010). [*](((ez0DqkFlC)))
            - The [[HTTSN]] workflow allows for the establishment of routines by providing users with the simple and repeatable tasks to do while reading & processing through a text. [*](((ngW0psLUC)))
                - This routine draws on the tenets David Allen outlines in his "Getting Things Done" framework. The premise is by offloading tasks in one place and handling every task the same (prioritization, processing, review), an individual is able to clear their working memory and experience "mind like water" where the individual can focus on the task in front of them. [*](((ngW0psLUC)))
            - Writing is not a linear process. As such, the [[HTTSN]] approach does not prescribe a linear process. Rather, it lays out a holistic process that connects reading, writing, and reviewing (as well as thinking and learning). [*](((wAz831-X5)))
        - [[1.2 The Slip-box]]
            - The slip-box is a conversation partner, able to engage the user to structure & develop thoughts and ultimately to generate ideas. [*](((BjFRHwXXy)))
            - Luhman was able to use his slip-box to be incredibly productive — drawing upon it over the course of his lifetime, he...
                - ... completed his doctoral thesis and habilitation thesis in less than a year (all while taking classes) [*](((coCtGuX4a)))
                - ... completed a "theory of society" called __The Society of Society__ in 30 years
                - ... published 58 books & hundreds of articles
                - ... had ~6 books published post-humously
            - #[[quote]] “I, of course, do not think everything by myself. It happens mainly within the slip-box” (Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 142). [*](((AFd1gnBPS)))
            - Part of Luhmann's ability to sustain such a high-level of quality output stemmed from the fact that he followed his passions and rarely lost threads. [*](((hhTaHBEnz)))
                - #[[quote]] “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f.)[ 4] [*](((j6EyoD7pi)))
            - **Paragraph:** Until recently, almost no one really seemed to believe it. We are still so used to the idea that a great outcome requires great effort that we tend not to believe that a simple change in our work routines could not only make us more productive, but the work also more fun. **But doesn’t it make much more sense that the impressive body of work was produced not in spite of the fact he never made himself do anything he didn’t feel like, but because of it? Even hard work can be fun as long as it is aligned with our intrinsic goals and we feel in control.** The problems arise when we set up our work in such an inflexible way that we can’t adjust it when things change and become arrested in a process that seems to develop a life of its own. [*](((7HSDsXHqL)))
                - #[[Q❓]] Important personal question: What are my intrinsic goals?
            - A productive workflow avoids resistance, redirecting energy into other areas when coming up against a blockage. [*](((hhTaHBEnz)))
            - Luhmann's slip-box and his workflow around it have long been dismissed as the foundation of his productivity because it was deemed "too simple" to be responsible for such a complex portfolio of work. Sometimes (most of the time), simple is better. [*](((j85ILtzRh)))
        - [[1.3 The slip-box manual]]
            - The slip-box is split into two parts: one for **literature notes** (bibliography) and one for **permanent notes** (ideas) [*](((fDWyGkGQL)))
            - #[[Q❓]] For literature notes, how much detail is appropriate? [*](((nN5f1vjN_)))
            - #[[Q❓]] Did Luhmann draw from both his fleeting and literature notes to pull together his permanent notes? [*](((55MjPqvfQ)))
            - Permanent notes should be... [*](((zt7lrN7X2)))
                - ... written with an eye towards integration with the rest of the slip-box.
                - ... concise and well thought out — ideas should be atomic.
                - ... explicitly connected to any source material they draw upon.
            - Notes should be translations from or extensions upon the source material or idea into the language of the author (and by extension, the language of the slipbox). [*](((iKecBcypp)))
            - When adding a new note to the slip-box, work to connect it to other related notes. In your own practice, this can occur within the box of a notes or more tangentially as a reference. [*](((LAHvoWGna)))
                - Make sure to look at **all relevant contexts** the note could connect to — do not limit yourself simply to related contexts. 
                    - Work to establish first order connections (similar subjects / topics) as well as second order connections (themes / concepts / ideas / models)
            - [[Sönke Ahrens]] description of why we need the slipbox: "...if I were forced to boil it down to a single bullet point, it would be this: We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains." [*](((kVuIQFmCg)))
    - {{[[DONE]]}} [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
        - The [[Zettelkasten]] and the [[Slip-box]] help you write in advance, fleshing out the (future) whole as you go... [*](((X7Ji9CUKq)))
        - Linking permanent notes as you go creates an implied outline for various arguments & claims [*](((gG5gSVgXN)))
            - >Equally manageable is the task of bringing already existing notes into order, especially if half of them already are in order. [*](((jFG19Kxzl)))
        - Writing facilitate learning of a concept or idea; translating an author's words into your own word is the best way to understand a concept or idea [*](((RN5JKBqxJ)))
            - Think of this as "external scaffolding" for the mind (term attributed to Neil Levy)
        - "2.1 Writing a paper step by step:"
            - **Step 1:** Fleeting Notes
                - Low-stress notes to take as you read, scribbled casual into a notepad or app
                - Put them into an inbox to be processed later
                - __This step is optional__ — [[Sönke Ahrens]] stated that its worthwhile to adapt the process to whatever you're reading
            - **Step 2:** Literature Notes
                - Write down what you don't want to forget or think you might use in your own writing or thinking
                - Short and selective, and in your own words
                - #QQ I often record demographics and other mundane facts in my personal database — these are important to understand and underpin higher level concepts and arguments — would Sonk consider these literature notes or permanent notes?
            - **Step 3:** Permanent Notes
                - Go through all of your notes from steps 1 & 2 and process them into permanent notes — the notes that contain key insights that add to your slip-box
                - As you add notes, link them to other permanent notes
                    - Pay particular attention to these relationships — do they support, contradict, correct, or add to any of the other notes you've already inserted into the slipbox...
            - Permanent notes should be well referenced and easily readable by someone unfamiliar with the slipbox
                - This is one of the reasons why the slipbox is so efficient at allowing users to publish — it is already built with consumption by outsiders in mind
            - Creating speculative outlines as you read can help to link notes and can also help identify where there are important areas for follow up [*](((nQY-Lsqjm)))
                - As you think about where the threads to follow, "always take the path that promises the most insight" [*](((erCjnBgLf)))
            - The slipbox and construction of a library of permanent notes means you are always working on multiple papers, articles, or post — some explicitly, others will emerge in the future... [*](((20T97LXDY)))
            - Add notes to your slipbox about everything you read that strikes you, regardless of if it falls within the realm of your current focus or research — more notes and ideas help build towards a critical mass. [*](((EegQ1h74c)))
            - Documenting ideas in this ways allows for slipbox users to nurture [[long hunches]] — big ideas that need a long time to mature. Throughout history the ideas that proved the most groundbreaking tended not to come about because of one eureka moment, but rather a slow accumulation of facts.♦

        - Currently working through my first pass of the book. 
            - Plan is to read it once, do minimal highlighting, load highlights to graph, and then go back for a re-read, either in Kindle or in the version we have here in the graph...
        - [[Chapter 5. Writing is the Only Thing That Matters]]
            - #[[⭐]] Writing helps to focus your attention on the open questions — these are the only questions worth writing about
        - [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
            - Sonke's example of Malcolm McLean inventing the shipping container is a great example of [[innovation]] [*](((cfebc0ULz)))
                - Thinking about to [[Book Club Version 1.0]], it's a good example of how [[innovation]] is built on exaptation and recombinations, and that some of the most impactful ideas come from novel combinations, which are not necessarily complicated ideas
            - It can only play out its strengths when we aim for a critical mass, which depends not only on the number of notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled.
            - Discoverability is paramount to offset the additional demands of building a bottom up process for note-taking, as the [[Zettelkasten]] is.
                - Roam makes this incredibly simple, but the [[Conventions]] need to be well thought out and rigorously enforced, otherwise your slip-box accrues no overall benefit for you (or at least a much more limited set)
            - "The advantage is obvious: No idea ever gets lost. The disadvantages are serious, though: As he treats every note as if it belongs to the “permanent” category, the notes will never build up a critical mass. The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight." [*](((7GWVsCHA5)))
                - Sonke on his friend who maintains a journal containing the totality of all of his notes
                - In my personal system, my notes follow a flow from seedling → budding → evergreen. 
                    - This is different mythology, inspired by [[Andy Matuschak]]'s idea of [[Evergreen Notes]] and layering in the terms used by Maggie Appleton (drawing on the idea of a [[Mind Garden]])
                    - I have never before thought about how I may accumulate more seedlings than I end up growing into evergreens. I will need a process to essentially deprioritize these, as they could end up clogging up my funnel from reading to evergreens.
                        - I also have a form of zettel in my personal notetaking that is pre-seedling, which is perhaps most akin to [[Fleeting Notes]] — I simple use a [Z:] tags, similar to our use of [Zettel] here.
                        - This allows me to essential tee up thoughts that I might want to write about, generally as I am processing through my highlights.
                        - The good thing with Roam is there is no need to ever really toss out [[Fleeting Notes]], but it is critical to be able to distinguish between those that have been processed, those awaiting processing, and those that have been discarded...
            - "as no underlined sentence will ever present itself when you need it in the development of an argument." [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
                - How does the added discoverability provided by a system like Roam allow for usage of these raw elements?
                    - e.g., I could tag this block with #[[highlighting]], #[[underlining]], #[[literature notes]], etc. and also #[[quote]]
            - The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference. [*](((UZ4XCHfSA)))
                - #[[Q❓]] What about simple facts and statistics? In [[Luhmann]]'s system, would these stay in [[Literature Notes]] and only the higher level concepts would be captured in [[Permanent Notes]]?
            - The idea of project-specific desktops ([mentioned here](((jLXwfvQda)))) are very similar to [[Andy Matuschak]]'s idea of [[Speculative Outlines]]
                - Andy suggests starting speculative outlines of evergreen notes, which is a form of top down organization. It could be for a specific project you're working on currently or just a general topic area.
                    - While [[Roam Research]] allows you to densely link pages and this helps to connect ideas, the process of building a speculative outline in another review step that can help you better understand what your notes contain.
                        - I think that the dense linking can be very helpful, as you could in theory build an outline simply using queries on a various sets of reference tags.

            - Can we change the color of the hashed references? They are difficult to read when you've selected an entire cell
    - [[November 3rd, 2020]]
        - Musings on my personal approach for [[Evergreen Notes]]
            - My current process today is as follows:
                - Pull a highlight (or set of highlights) from an article or book and load it to Roam
                - Review the highlights (and accompanying notes if I’ve made them) and generate high level ideas
                - Turn these ideas into [Z:] references
                - Go into the individual pages, add the type flag and then begin to write a more thorough note on the topic
            - How can I accommodate fleeting notes? Often now I will use the [❓] or the [⭐️] references, but perhaps it would be better to start using the [Z:]?
                - I could still store any references underneath, as well as important additional thoughts, similar to the emoji tags, but it would be easier to turn a fleeting note into a draft permanent note...
                - However, important to remember that not all fleeting notes make it permanent notes, and excessive usage of the [Z:] tag could end up clogging the filter...
                - Something to ponder going forward
    - [[November 8th, 2020]] [[Live Session 2]]
        - Daily Prompt
            - "How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method."
        - Breakout Group Number - YOURNUMBERHERE
            - Who was in this group on 11.8.20::
            - Any struggles or challenges identified?:: 
            - Anything you are excited about?::
            - Does the concept of a "Fleeting Note" make sense to you?::
        - "Graph Meditation #[[Graph Meditation]]"
            - Love [[Matt McKinlay]]'s questions related to [[lines of inquiry]]. Teasing out a single line of inquiry in a [[multiplayer]] undertaking will be difficult, but assembling a few core threads seems important.
                - "How do we develop collective lines of thought in Book Club?  How do we navigate the zettel concept if we don't have a collective line of inquiry? "
                - "Line of inquiry- Do we need centrally set lines of inquiry? Or let them form from bottom up? Are there constraints? "
                - Without a bearing on the [[lines of inquiry]], it will be difficult to coalesce the zettling process into something that produces a coherent output at the order of the group.
                - I think back to the [[Roam Book Club (V1.0)]] and realize that I was interested in two main topics
                    1. Learning about [[Steven Johnson]]'s book and the concepts around [[innovation]], which I've incorporated into my thinking about cities & urbanism
                    2. Engaging in a common activity with a ton of other interested individuals
                - The outcome of the first bullet above was a set of permanent notes for me that I am building on now with other related readings. The outcome of the second is [[Roam Book Club (V2.0)]].
                - However, in [[Roam Book Club (V1.0)]] we never came to a final coherent output that we could carry forward. I think that this was a missed opportunity, but am hopeful we can crack it in [[Roam Book Club (V2.0)]].
                    - What does this look like? Hard to say... I think a guide to taking smart notes, with examples of individual workflows (maybe based on motivation — e.g., academic writing, building an online brand, building general knowledge) would be a fantastic artifact for the group to collectively author...
    - [[November 29th, 2020]] [[Live Session 5]]
        - Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month. [*](((XSNQcvese)))
            - I decided to take a first pass through the book using my old approach to reading — highlighting passages of interest with the intention of going back and processing them after the fact. The entire process too me longer than I might have liked and as such, many of the fleeting thoughts I had in the early chapters were no longer in my memory by the time I got to the later chapters.
            - As such, I've begun to reread the book, working to take literature notes as I go. I've found myself more engaged and better able to grasp what Sonke is writing. Though I've only progressed through one or two chapters, the process of reading and writing at the same time has obvious benefits. As I refamiliarize myself with the content and the approach, there are a number of questions that I need to answer as I work to incorporate Sonke's approach into my reading habits. Specifically...
                - #[[Q❓]] Is it feasible to take literature notes as your work through a first reading of a text? 
                    - Taking this approach, how do you balance fleeting and literature notes?
                - #[[Q❓]] What level of depth is appropriate for literature notes?
                    - My guess is that this is an understand you build and will depend on the type of materials you're reading...

                - Zettel:: The [[Zettelkasten Workflow]] allows users to focus on the thinking contained within a text — "the content, the argument, & the ideas" — instead of extraneous details
                    - Supports: "Zettel:: The robustness of the slipbox allows users to easily change lines of inquiry, pursuing the path with the most insight"
            - Zettel:: Using a [[Zettelkasten Workflow]] mitigates the downsides of strict planning — a workflow is flexible and can adapt, whereas a plan breaks down unless followed to a tee
                - "Research must occur within a structure, but should not follow a strict plan. [*](((e5t8EGtoY)))"
                    - "Following a strict plan restricts one's ability to follow insight."
                - #[[⭐]] A step-by-step approach does not work for research! If it did, you would already know everything on the topic at hand, therefore you wouldn't need any research!
            - Zettel:: When exploring [[lines of inquiry]], it is critical to prioritize information from outside of your discipline as much as information within
                - "Within this structured approach to research (relying on a workflow instead of a plan), "peeking over the fences of your own discipline" is critical for exposing oneself to different ideas and identifying new and interesting research questions. [*](((GgF6t07Z4)))"
                - "By confining themselves neatly to their discipline and reading only what is required, poor students find it very easy to complete what is asked of them."
                - Zettel:: Exploring disciplines outside of one's own allows for the opportunity to identify new questions to answer
                    - "Good students work to look beyond their discipline and identify questions they cannot answer and entire disciplines they no nothing about. [*](((Y0L49bjII)))"
            - Zettel:: The [[Slipbox]] is a conversation partner for thought — as you write, you are writing a letter to a future you; as you review, you are conversing with a past you
                - "The slip-box is a conversation partner, able to engage the user to structure & develop thoughts and ultimately to generate ideas. [*](((BjFRHwXXy)))"
                - "The [[Zettelkasten]] and the [[Slip-box]] help you write in advance, fleshing out the (future) whole as you go... [*](((X7Ji9CUKq)))"
            - Zettel:: A literature note can be thought of as a bibliography, drawing directly on the argument in the text
                - "The slip-box is split into two parts: one for **literature notes** (bibliography) and one for **permanent notes** (ideas) [*](((fDWyGkGQL)))"
                - Literature notes should focus on extracting the content of a piece of work
            - Zettel:: A permanent note captures an idea or concept, based upon fleeting or literature notes (or sometimes, directly taken from the text)
                - #QQ What is the difference between a permanent note and an Evergreen note?
                - "Permanent notes should be... [*](((zt7lrN7X2)))"
                    - "... written with an eye towards integration with the rest of the slip-box."
                    - "... concise and well thought out — ideas should be atomic."
                    - "... explicitly connected to any source material they draw upon."
                - Because: "Zettel:: [[Writing]] an idea down is the best way to learn that concept or idea; translating a concept or idea into your own words is the best way to understand that concept or idea"
                    - "Notes should be translations from or extensions upon the source material or idea into the language of the author (and by extension, the language of the slipbox). [*](((iKecBcypp)))"
            - Zettel:: Creating connections from notes in the [[Slipbox]] serves to add additional context to permanent notes
                - "When adding a new note to the slip-box, work to connect it to other related notes. In your own practice, this can occur within the box of a notes or more tangentially as a reference. [*](((LAHvoWGna)))"
                - Zettel:: Creating links also helps to build implicit arguments and claims, which can be rolled into higher-level concepts
                    - "Linking permanent notes as you go creates an implied outline for various arguments & claims [*](((gG5gSVgXN)))"
                    - Because: "Zettel:: When exploring [[lines of inquiry]], it is critical to prioritize information from outside of your discipline as much as information within"
                        - "Make sure to look at **all relevant contexts** the note could connect to — do not limit yourself simply to related contexts. "
                - Zettel:: Conversations with ideas in the [[Slipbox]] and out of the slipbox should focus on building complexity of thought and ideas
                    - #[[⭐]] This is a concept I've read from [[Andy Matuschak]]...
                - Zettel:: Proactively outlining arguments, dubbed [[speculative outlines]] by [[Andy Matuschak]], can help to create connections, flesh out implicit arguments, and   aid future publication
                    - "Creating speculative outlines as you read can help to link notes and can also help identify where there are important areas for follow up [*](((nQY-Lsqjm)))"
                    - "The slipbox and construction of a library of permanent notes means you are always working on multiple papers, articles, or post — some explicitly, others will emerge in the future... [*](((20T97LXDY)))"
            - Zettel:: Using a [[Slipbox]] & the [[Zettelkasten Workflow]] is a proactive research approach — you build out your research before you need it...
                - "The [[Zettelkasten]] and the [[Slip-box]] help you write in advance, fleshing out the (future) whole as you go... [*](((X7Ji9CUKq)))"
            - Zettel:: Literature notes should work to extract the useful content from a piece of content (written word, podcast, etc.)
                - "Write down what you don't want to forget or think you might use in your own writing or thinking"
            - Zettel:: Permanent notes should work to synthesize ideas (from texts, literature notes, and fleeting notes) — the note should be clear, concise, and have the context a normal reader would appreciate
                - "Permanent notes should be well referenced and easily readable by someone unfamiliar with the slipbox"
                - #[[⭐]] this upfront helps immensely with publication 
            - Zettel:: Using a [[Slipbox]] is an effective way to nurture [[long hunches]] — big ideas that need a long time to mature.
                - #[[⭐]] Throughout history the ideas that proved the most groundbreaking tended not to come about because of one eureka moment, but rather a slow accumulation of facts. [*](((KSSUqOKjP)))
