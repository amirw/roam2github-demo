    - [[Goals of Book Club]]
        - I want to develop a foundation for reading to create:
            - Content
            - A better Tracy through:
                - Mental models for life, relationships, business, and spiritual maturity
                - Making sure my mindset is on a consistent path toward growth
        - The idea is that when I learn how to get stuff out of my brain and into pixels or paper that I have the opportunity to do the next right things in front of me, to create content that matters and helps others, and helps me live a fulfilling life of personal and professional growth.
