- [[How to Take Smart Notes]]
    - [[Introduction]]
        - A good framework for taking notes can help reduce the need for [[willpower]], and make the whole process of taking notes, developing ideas and creating new content effective and enjoyable. #[[Literature Notes]]
            - What makes a task “interesting, meaningful and well-defined”? Can any task be repositioned or reframed to be like that? [*](((tIetkYe5Q)))
            - [Christopher’s point re GTD](((A36tN_nSb))) - totally does remind of GTD.
        - By separating note taking and idea developing in discrete steps, you introduce the ability to get immediate feedback on each step, and thus improve faster. #[[Literature Notes]]
            - [*](((5nAs6bD4t))) How to reduce the feedback loop on note take in? On each stage of note taking?
        - If the note taking is effectively setup, then successful writing gets easy. #[[Literature Notes]]
            - Oh, and the [“frozen pizza”](((IaqWr_-kG))) comparison is great, too!
            - #quote "the key to successful writing lies in the preparation" [*](((-AeNlDTdF))) 
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] the point about preparation reminds me of a quote from a running coach about marathon training. Once you get to the starting line the only thing left is to enjoy yourself, all the worrying and the hard work were in preparation. 
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - You need to collect and organize your notes in way that allows for cross-discipline and cross-categories connections and discoveries. #[[Literature Notes]]
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Consider looking into cited research here.
            - [*](((U4Q7m4mQO))) [*](((LAHvoWGna))) [*](((k1R5hvOJl))) [*](((gq3S3MuUq))) [*](((XdGixKkuK))) [*](((kVuIQFmCg)))
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Relationships between the notes are either captured by proximity (e.g. one right after the other), explicit linking (e.g. A is opposed to B), or via index as an entry point.
            - #quote Good students also look beyond the obvious. They peek over the fences of their own disciplines–and once you have done that, you cannot go back and do what everyone else is doing, even if you now must deal with heterogeneous ideas that come without a manual on how they might fit together. [*](((GgF6t07Z4)))
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The ideas of liquid network, exaptation from [[Steven Johnson]]'s [[Books/Where Good Ideas Come From]] resonate with this paragraph.
            - #quote They sort their notes by topics and sub-topics, which makes it look less complex, but quickly becomes very complicated. Plus, it reduces the likelihood of building and finding surprising connections between the notes themselves, which means a trade-off between its usability and usefulness. [*](((FfwvQnsGs)))
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] reminded me of the not-organizing-the-email chapter from [[Books/Algorithms to Live By]] by [[Brian Christian]] and [[Tom Griffiths]]
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] #Question what is the simplest possible structure for organization of notes in roam, if any? Should I be on the look out for what creates friction in the workflow?
        - For insights-oriented writing you need to build habits for regular creation, review and development of connections between your notes. Those habits are fundamental and do not depend on tools, although some tools may help reduce the friction from the process. A developed habit will further eliminate the need for [[willpower]] in the process. #[[Literature Notes]]
            - #quote Even the best tool will not improve your productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines the tool is embedded in, just as the fastest car won’t help you much if you don’t have proper roads to drive it on. Like every change in behaviour, a change in working habits means going through a phase where you are drawn back to your old ways. [*](((ez0DqkFlC)))
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] #Question What are the **daily** habits that I should develop? How can I follow guidance from [[Atomic Habits]] to make them stick faster?
            - #quote It is in the nature of writing, especially insight-oriented writing, that questions change, the material we work with turns out to be very different from the one imagined or that new ideas emerge, which might change our whole perspective on what we do. [*](((oz882t9yv)))
                - #[[Fleeting Notes]] when you start writing something you do not necessarily know where you are going to end up. 
            - #quote Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place (cf. Neal et al. 2012; Painter et al. 2002; Hearn et al. 1998). [*](((hhTaHBEnz)))
    - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]] 
        - Writing almost take care of itself when you assemble an outline from a collection of ideas taken from what you read (literature notes) and related insights and ideas that you developed yourself (permanent notes). #[[Literature Notes]]
            - #quote [It is already a fully developed argument including all references, quotes and some really smart ideas.](((X7Ji9CUKq)))
            - Literature notes to be kept with bibliographic references. #[[Fleeting Notes]]
        - It could be disruptive to break the flow of reading to pause and formulate a literature note. This is where highlights and fleeting notes could come into play to serve as reminders to form the idea later. A sign of a good fleeting note is creation of enough details to remember the idea that appeared while reading with minimal friction to the reading process. #[[Literature Notes]]
            - Fleeting notes are a mere reminders of what was in my head. #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                - Can skip that step if the idea is formed. 
            - How to leverage inbox for fleeting notes? Daily processing? #[[Fleeting Notes]]
            - Discussions / combinations / writing for someone else - could be good framing for permanent notes #[[Fleeting Notes]]
        - Literature and permanent notes have higher value if they are interconnected and diverse. As you are bringing more ideas to your collection, consider adding those that challenge and contradict what you already have. #[[Literature Notes]] 
            - Why am I hesitating to write own ideas in the slipbox? #[[Fleeting Notes]]
            - Good notes contradict ideas / challenge ideas already in slipbox  #[[Fleeting Notes]]
            - How to balance not letting ideas go to waste and hoarding information? #[[Fleeting Notes]]
        - Here is an example of contradicting ideas: a common illustration for "focusing on essentials" is a story about NASA spending millions of dollars on development of a space pen while Russians were using pencils. If you look up details of the story, then it is not as straightforward. Bits of paper from grease pencils and graphite from mechanical pencils led to increased fire risk, which lead to Soviet Union purchasing space pens for Soyuz flights starting in 1967. #[[Literature Notes]]
            - {{[[DONE]]}} There was an issue with [Space pen and pencil story](((sZZifNT1C))), look it up! #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                - NASA originally purchased 34 pencils for $4,382.50 (or  $128.89 each), that caused controversy. When Fisher developed space pen (after having reportedly invested $1m in R&D), they sold it to NASA at $6 per pen. In 1967 Soviet Union purchased 100 space pens for Soyuz flights. [*](https://history.nasa.gov/spacepen.html)
                - This article provides a bit more details about the use of grease pencils by Russians and mechanical pencils by Americans prior to use of the space pen. The issue with pencils was either bits of paper or graphite floating around as a result of use and increased risk of fire. [*](https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/13103/russians-didnt-just-use-pencils-space)
    - [[Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have]] #[[Fleeting Notes]]
        - Having a holistic workflow allows you to play with tools, if so inclined. Slipbox could be that type of holistic workflow for the note taking.
        - Capturing ideas needs to be quick and with minimal friction. That inbox needs to be easy to fill. 
    - [[Chapter 4. A Few Things to Keep in Mind]]

                - Watching TV decreased attention span in children. What helps increase it? Meditation?
                - Multitasking segment reminds me of [[Tim Ferriss]]'s DiSSS (Deconstructions, Selection, Sequencing and Stakes), particularly the deconstruction part.
                - Theme: removing willpower dependency: focused attention requires dependence on willpower
                - Open tasks occupy RAM until they are done. 
                    - "While this is almost a universal law for longer time frames, the opposite is true for tasks that can be completed in one go. This is partly due to the aforementioned Zeigarnik effect (Zeigarnik 1927), in which our brains tend to stay occupied with a task until it is accomplished (or written down). If we have the finish line in sight, we tend to speed up, as everyone knows who has ever run a marathon. That means that the most important step is to get started. Rituals help, too (Currey 2013)."
                - Always write down the outcome of thinking = closing the working session, if not written it did not happen
                - Defined context for work (time, space, etc) reduces friction and decision fatigue, same applies to the system. Consistent workflow that does not change may be more effective than ever changing workflow. 
                - Remember to take breaks

Rereading is especially dangerous because of the mere-exposure effect: The moment we become familiar with something, we start believing we also understand it. On top of that, we also tend to like it more (Bornstein 1989)."

Conversely, manipulations such as keeping conditions constant and predictable and massing trials on a given task often appear to enhance the rate of learning during instruction or training, but then typically fail to support long-term retention and transfer” (Bjork, 2011, 8)."

                - from this perspective using tags for permanent notes does not make sense - should use relations to other notes as a priority. 
                    - how many relations? At least one, but feels better to have 3-4 diverse ones. 
            - to map back to slipbox one has to recall contents (or at least edges of slipbox) immediately, that way literature notes could be added in context faster.

    - [[Afterword]]
- Developing literature notes
    - [[How To Take Smart Notes]] is not a book about taking notes. It is a book about a holistic workflow for capturing and developing ideas in a network of interconnected atomic notes. This network of notes can serve as an incubator for developing more ideas and as an assistant in writing projects. #[[Literature Notes]]
    - [[Sönke Ahrens]] emphasizes that in a writing workflow nothing counts other than writing [[How To Take Smart Notes, Chapter 5](((9LdD6VzxA)))]. As you read, you write "fleeting notes" to capture ideas in the most frictionless way possible, "literature notes" to capture the gist of of the read material, and "permanent notes" that connect literature notes and other permanent notes into a network of interconnected ideas.  #[[Literature Notes]]
    - [[Sönke Ahrens]] elaborates that writing is not linear and that interest and curiosity should lead the reader rather than following a pre-defined outline. When you start writing something you do not necessarily know where you are going to end up.  #[[Literature Notes]]
    - [[Sönke Ahrens]] offers a collection of practices: , each culminating in writing. Those practices together form a non-linear workflow 
    - First stage is fleeting notes, you take them as you read. The nature of fleeting notes is high-level and temporary. They serve one purpose — remind your future self of an idea or a thought that occurred to you when you read the material. 
    - When you process your fleeting notes, you can choose to turn some of them into Literature notes. Those would become atomic thought units, which you make yours by elaborating source material in your own words.
    - **Only write in your own words.**
Elaboration of ideas and thoughts in your own words leads to better understanding and higher recall.
    - **Seek to connect every note with at least one other.**
Connecting ideas in a network allows for better recall via association, surprising insights and connections, and formation of clusters of ideas, which could be used for producing writing outputs.
    - **Seek diversity and alternative opinions**
To avoid confirmation bias and to enrich the network of own ideas, seek to find variations of the ideas.
    - Literature notes connected within a network of all of your other ideas, both personal and based on the writing of others. The notes that connect literature notes with other ideas are "permanent notes". 
    - Strongly interconnected permanent notes create a network and a system. Each additional note generates new connections and combinations of ideas.

- Live Session 3
    - "Define a literature note in your own words."
        - Literature note is an elaboration in your own words of the idea that you read somewhere. Literature note is atomic in nature and can be used within your future writing or in connection with other ideas.
    - "How do you take literature notes? Discuss your method."
        - Review the fleeting notes, try to remember the material read, and then produce a tweet-long paragraph of an idea. Usually this requires several re-writes. I am still struggling with building the right context for writing literature notes.
    - "Have you found value in taking literature notes already?"
        - Yes, when taking notes on trade articles or reports, that immediately inspired to produce new writing material. I have a number of twitter threads published and a few more in the works because of that.
    - "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?"
        - Finding the right time, space and state of mind to do that. So far tried morning hours, afternoon hours, right after work.... with various degree of success. Merely doing it should do the trick. I have not tried pomodoro yet, and this will be the next thing I try. 
    - "Describe any enlightening moments you had while taking literature notes."
        - Taking literature notes is hard (at least early on).  And it illustrates how terrible the memory is and how much I really understand vs. how much I thought I understood. Confronting those challenges was enlightening and helped emphasize that working on literature notes is useful not just for notes' sake, but as an indicator of the quality of previous stages.

        - 
    - "What have you learnt about note taking that I (Sönke) should know about?"
        - Group note taking is possible, some structure emerges if there is desire from the group to get some order within a chaos. WIth a group, need to accept that multiple people with contribute with different degree of involvement. 
        - Creating a peer group that is learning this note taking approach together increases the probability of long-term application.
    - "Are there any additions to the process described in the book?"
        - Highlights maybe a way to automate bibliographic references (e.g. via readwise sync)
        - For literature notes it helps to have a map of the book.
    - "Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten?"
        - I noticed that I got more excited about the process and system than the output of the system. I perceive this as a risk that the system will not have output. I am making an effort to focus on publishing outputs produced from my notes. 
    - "(what use cases does it work for? Are there any examples it doesn't work for?)"
        - I am curious about application for Zettelkasten in commercial environment: case studies and knowledge base in a professional services organization paid with industry research; documentation of systems and solutions (both how it works and why it was built that way)
    - "Reflect on your impressions of the book "
        - High information density. The helpful dimension that the book club added was practical exercises and peers who were working on understanding the approach, which helped create a group learning experience.
    - "Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?"
        - My mindset for outputs of my reading has changed. Checking understanding with re-phrasing is perhaps one of the strongest takeaways.
    - "Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?  "
        - Yes, in different application: both work and personal. 
            - For work, "I am curious about application for Zettelkasten in commercial environment: case studies and knowledge base in a professional services organization paid with industry research; documentation of systems and solutions (both how it works and why it was built that way)"

- "[[Live Session 4]] Starting 12:30 PM PST"
    - "{{[[DONE]]}} **Section 1** [[Writing practice]]"
        - "Reflect on the book.  What are you impressions? "
            - A good combination of practical advice and explanation of the "why". Overall signal to noise ratio in the book is good.
        - "Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way? "
            - This was my first time going beyond highlights/fleeting notes. I am still figuring it out, but immediate impression is it will be helpful for remembering what I read months later.
                - The elaboration/translation in my own words also serves as an indicator of understanding, and therefore serves as a good indicator how much I am paying attention while reading. 
        - "Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? "
            - Timeline pressure has been good. Probably should have combined fleeting and literature notes phases and split the book in 3 parts, essentially limiting reading time per week to 1.5-2.5 hours. 
        - "How is your progress towards your initial goals? Or have they changed?"
            - Here are my goals as they were written during kick off of RBC2
                - "Improve my personal writing process through ideas of the book and ideas generated by other members of the book club. "
                    - {{[[slider]]}}
So far so good. Need to explore more pages of others.
                - "Get to know at least 20 new people from the book club. "
                    - {{[[slider]]}}
                    - Met at least 20 new people — yes
                    - Got to know at least 20 new people — not yet.
                - "Get a better understanding how a large group like ours can self-organize. "
                    - {{[[slider]]}}
                    - Very limited observations so far, need to plan some more time 
                - "Contribute to community by helping new Roam users find their way around the shared graph. ((if you are reading this and need help, don’t hesitate to email me "Email:: [ashchedrin@hey.com](mailto:ashchedrin@hey.com)")"
                    - 3 sessions so far, feel that I brought some value on this. I am still making myself available for 1:1 meetings
                        - "Also, #Announcement, if you feel overwhelmed and lost, I am making some time over the next 2 weeks to be available to help. [Book a meeting here](https://calendar.x.ai/ashchedrin/rbc-help)  "
        - "Explore the concept of permanent notes/zettels."
            - "Explain what a permanent note is in your own words?"
                - Either connection between multiple literature notes or personal ideas, fully formulated and atomic
            - "What is holding you back from creating zettels?"
                - Nothing, just need to make more time to get to it.
