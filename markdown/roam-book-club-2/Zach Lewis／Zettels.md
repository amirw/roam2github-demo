        - #[[Literature Notes]] More energy is not the answer to more work. A state of flow is the goal because the work becomes the energizing force itself.
            -  It is a commonly said in physics that more energy is required to maintain energy. The same mentality is applied to work but that is not always the reality. In a state of workflow, or flow, the work is what is pushing you forward, requiring little effort and if anything energizing us. A state of flow is the goal.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] More energy does not equal more output, structure to uphold workflow (not plan), flow as a state of no abruption, key in momentum is maintaining in-between of the sprints, 
            - Biggest thing was the idea of common misconception of energy = more energy is more energy
                - Straight out of school
                    - Work all you want

                                    - The answer is to do harder
                                        - But the reality is time is super-limited
                                            - It is but it isn't
                                                - And it's unrealistic and not good for yourself
