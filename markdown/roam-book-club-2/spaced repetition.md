- ### Here is a brief [[Tutorial]] of how to use Anki-style spaced repetition using the Roam Toolkit browser extension (chrome/firefox) ... (this tutorial written by [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] on [[November 29th, 2020]])
    - (P.S you will sometimes see the acronym "SRS" used to refer to "spaced repetition system")
    - (P.S.S) for today I will be focusing solely on the bare-bones of the practical implementation of the system. 
        - But trust me, there also is a DEEP and important discussion of how to make BEST use of it - just as there is also a deep discussion of how to best use Zettelkasten...
        - ... Today I'm just covering the basics!
    - **What is Anki-style spaced repetition?**
        - "Anki" is a free, open-source web-based platform that allows users to create sets of flashcards
            - [Anki (software) - Wikipedia](https://tinyurl.com/lcwqbck)
        - It utilizes "spaced repetition" and has an inbuilt algorithm that is based on the work of [[Piotr Wozniak]], who pioneered the use of this technique in the 1980s with the platform "[[Supermemo]]"
            - [SuperMemo - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo)
        - The best way to illustrate ^^how it works^^ is probably with an example
            - **Suppose I am learning a foreign language ...**
                - Let's say I make a flashcard to test myself on my knowledge of a verb conjugation
                - The __first time__ I create the flashcard I'd like to review it, say __tomorrow.__
                    - But then when I review it and remember it tomorrow, I would like to to review it, say, three days later. 
                    - And then a week after that. 
                    - All the while ... as long as I keep "getting it" ... the interval "expands" ...
                - Let's say I really know it pretty well, so the interval is extended to a month, three months, and then six months. Woohoo, I am on a roll, I really know this.
                - **BUT!**
                - Oh no. After six months the flashcard stumps me. I have forgotten. üôÅ
                - Here's the thing:
                    - Do I really want to start the whole process over again?
                    - No. 
                    - The truth is, I just had to clear away a mental cobweb in order to refresh, but deep down, I kind of know it. 
                - Therefore ...
                    - This time, I'll be reminded of the flashcard maybe the next day, but then I'll see it again, not in three days, but maybe in a week, 
                    - then out to a few months, etc. - on an accelerated schedule, back out to the six month interval, or whenever.
                    - In other words, the repetition process got "fast tracked" to reflect that I really just needed a one-off reminder 
                        - ... but, in fact I do know it better than I did, when I first created the flashcard. 
                        - So I do NOT have to see it as frequently as I did when I was learning it for the very first time. 
                - In other words **the algorithm is ADAPTIVE - it has a "memory" of my performance of any given flashcard** and uses that "memory" to make an algorithmic "decision" of when to show it to me again 
                    - ... the algorithm is custom-tailored, based on my feedback, to select the optimum interval to facilitate my own retention and review of the content! 
                        - Yay!
    - **That sounds super cool. How can I start?**
        - It turns out to be super easy. First install the "Roam Toolkit" browser extension.
            - for Chrome:
                - [Roam Toolkit - Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/roam-toolkit/ebckolanhdjilblnkcgcgifaikppnhba?hl=en-US)
            - for Firefox:
                - [Roam Toolkit ‚Äì Get this Extension for ü¶ä Firefox (en-US)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/roam-toolkit/)
            - for Safari: NOT YET, but anticipated when Safari 12 comes out
        - The Roam Toolkit, once installed, should show up as a tiny astrolabe (Roam icon) in your browser extensions menu
            - (in Chrome, you have to "manage the extensions" via the little icon that looks like a puzzle piece and select that you want it "pinned")
        - Click this icon to get a pull-down menu that looks like this:
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FO-DG6ew6Q3.png?alt=media&token=571a581c-89b2-4d31-8940-7b8bc2d77082)
        - As you can see, there are three boxes that I checked. 
            - The other things that Roam Toolkit allows you to do are beyond my scope to talk about today, but for now... 
            - just make sure you **click the checkbox of "spaced repetition"**, in order to turn it on.
        - If you click on the little grey right-arrow, you'll get the menu of key-commands. It looks like this:
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FWBfmVd1sEb.png?alt=media&token=72fd0c83-982e-4575-b592-f41c3071b7dc)
        - Now, personally, 

I find the nomenclature of "again hard good easy" a little confusing, 

so I prefer to use the nomenclature of "shallow to deep": (see picture)

The meaning of this nomenclature will be clear after you read the next sections of this tutorial. 
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FEdsWbVj3QF.jpg?alt=media&token=55effd60-c113-466d-80f5-8819a0d2c449)
            - 
    - **How do I create a new flashcard?**
        - When you want to create a new flashcard you want to start "shallow": 
meaning, "I want to review this as soon as possible." 
            - Like, next-day soon. 
            - It's a brand new flashcard, and you want to review it while the concept is "fresh".
        - So **to create a new flashcard**, with the cursor positioned within any block, 
     just hit `ctrl-shift-1`
        - Whoa! That block just got tagged with some weird looking metadata and a date.
            - It looks something like this:
            - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FjPMRJ7KCQW.png?alt=media&token=8071ad7f-e3b9-4ddb-91aa-3fd8d27e8cd4)
            - Aww, man. ^^That's so ugly!^^ and confusing!

            - And, it will clash with my custom "Count Chocula visits Miami" CSS theme!
            - **But wait! CSS CAN FIX THIS! **
            - There is a custom CSS you can install that will clean up the ugly looking metadata.
                - " This CSS makes spaced interval metadata look more beautiful (see: [[spaced repetition]])"
            - Now it looks like this:
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2F43-ypKdlzm.png?alt=media&token=ea2c2044-f406-4e85-81e3-a1de5b6b27a5)
            -  Now, you have a date-notification that will link to the day you are scheduled to review this flash-card (i.e. November 30th)
            - "Wait did you say, ^^"flashcard"^^? 
 But it's just a block. 
 How do I make it act like a flashcard?"
                - Easy peasey. 
                - Just put a QUESTION in the block, and indent the answer below, and then close the sub-indent. 
                - Then when you review, you have to "open" the sub-indent to see the answer.
    - **So what happens on the review-date?**
        - For now, the flash-card will appear in the unlinked references to the daily page that it got date-stamped with. 
            - (P.S. ^^I highly recommend^^ using a "query" to create a "catchment area" for your review flashcards within your Daily Notes template, so that they all show up in one place... this also allows for a custom way to ensure flashcards do not get "lost" if you skip a review day.)
                - I'm going to show you that, a little later... "**What do you mean by creating a "Catchment" for the flashcards?**"
        - But for now, just imagine that you are reviewing the flashcards, by scrolling through all the daily note linked refs, to find the flashcards. 
        - Now is your chance to give "feedback" to the algorithm - to let it know how well you've internalized the flashcard.
            - To do this you need to position the cursor within the block that has been date-stamped.
            - and THEN you choose one of the four options `Ctrl-shift-one through four`
                - Basically, if it "stumped" you, you want to hit `Ctrl-shift-1` to keep it "shallow" and show it to you again in a really short interval
                - If you stone cold KNOW it, to the level of "automatic assocation", and want the algorithm to send it "deep", i.e. as far forward in time as possible, `ctrl-shift-4`
                - Then, I use `ctrl-shift-2` to denote "I knew it, but it was a struggle to recall"
                - `ctrl-shift-3` denotes "Yeah I knew it, but it was not yet an automatic association"
        - Based on your feedback ...
            - the algorithm instantly readjusts the metadata and assigns it a new date-tag somewhere further in the future. 
        - BOOM! 
    - **What do you mean by creating a "Catchment" for the flashcards?**
        - The "catchment" is a `{{query: }}` that you put into your daily notes template to "pull" all of that day's review-cards into one place for easy and convenient review.
        - This is the exact syntax of the query on my page:
            - `#minimal {{[[query]]: {and: [[` ^^TODAY'S DATE^^ `]] #interval {not: [[query]]} }}}`
        - **Why** did I start the query with the hashtag `#minimal`?
            - That's a little CSS "trick" 
            - It utilizes a separate snippet of CSS code which I will also share
                - 
            - Its purpose is to instruct the `{{query:}}` function that follows to display ONLY the exact blocks that match and NOT to display the long list of "breadcrumbs" associated with the block, i.e. the page title, the blocks above it in the heierarchy, etc.
            - This is for two reasons
                - 1. looks neater
                - 2. the surrounding blocks might contain "clues" to my flashcard and for now I want to be blinded to those clues
                    - (although, note, if I WANT to see those contextual clues I still can, just by jumping to the block)
        - **How** do I template the query so it "knows" what ^^TODAY'S DATE^^ is and inserts the correct date, whatever day it is?
            - This requires either a text expander program (I use "Textblaze") to fill out the template,
            - OR
            - you can create auto-fill templates using javascript tools like Roam42.
        - Why does the query also include `{not: [[query]]}`?
            - this is a weird little quirk of queries - they do not exclude themselves, from their own search results. 
            - therefore, any time you write a `{{query}}` in Roam, you need to tell it not to return itself as one of its search results (since, in this case, the query itself DOES include all the terms you are searching for.)
    - **(Advanced topic) what's the second big reason that I recommend you create a "Catchment" area with a **`{{query:}}``?
        - You may have noticed by now that if on some day you either forget to, or are unable to review your flashcards, that you might "lose" a flashcard - because once that day passes, you'll never be auto-prompted for it again, so unless you actively go looking for it, it might drop out of your active review...
            - FOREVER!
            - Oh, no!
        - But wait, there is a solution.
        - I call this solution the **checkbox safety net**.
        - Here's **how it works.**
            - On you daily note, you nest your catchment query (see above) BENEATH a bullet that includes both a `#safety-net` hashtag and a `{{[[TODO]]}}` checkbox
            - On my daily journal it looks like this -
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FQO8Ml-krc4.png?alt=media&token=759f428a-33c5-4869-89cd-bd34db7af304)
            - You only mark this as "DONE" after you've completed that day's review
            - So ...
            - If you want to check the safety net for "missed cards"
            - You go to a home page of some kind (mine is called `[[SRS Home]]`)
            - And on that page
            - you make a query for all unchecked "TODOs" that are also tagged with `#safety-net`
            - in this case, it will pull all, only ONLY, those blocks of flashcards that you have not yet reviewed (i.e. not yet changed to "DONE".)
            - Looks like this:
