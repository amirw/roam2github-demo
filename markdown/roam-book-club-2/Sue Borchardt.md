        - I read [[How to Take Smart Notes]] about the same time I started using roam (January 2020?) and took a ton of notes in my own graph. I think what I'm more interested in for these four weeks is experimenting with what it's like to try to work in a shared graph with others. I've tried this a bit with [[Joel Chan]] and it's been kinda painful. This is partly because I'm jumping into the deep end of his existing graph and he as established conventions quite different from mine (which are fairly non-existent -- i'm pretty ad-hoc). It's also been frustrating in that I can't migrate my insights back to my own graph. 
- How to Take Smart Notes::
    - [[Introduction]]
        - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
            - "It's a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing about" pg 6. Ahrens describes the challenge as one of planning for insight which, by definition, cannot be planned. He asserts that one NEEDS a system for making sense of an ever-increasing pool of heterogeneous information & ideas (I think of this as an engine). Another premise Ahrens has is that writing is the main tool for achieving insights worth sharing. But is the key aspect here the act of #externalization? #making[[thinking]]visible.
                - "Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement–which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception. Even though planning is often at odds with the very idea of research and learning, it is the mantra of most study guides and self-help books on academic writing. How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated? It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery–or insight."
            - Organizing information using hierarchy sacrifices usability for usefulness. 
            - [[Ahrens]] references Getting things done #GTD and the practice of regularly checking if our "tasks" fit into the bigger picture of what we are trying to accomplish. I have a problem with this as sometimes -- especially at the creative edge of activity -- the link to the emergent is unmakable. BUT he does make the point (pg 10 ) that making the tentative declaration (closing the question of what we are aiming for and what we have on TODO list) frees up working memory and that the open things should be related to sense-making and making connections - space for #insight
            - [[Luhmann]] made a note whenever he had an interesting thought and these scribbled distributed thoughts and ideas were always transferred to his #Zettelkasten. THIS is the step I've not yet embraced. 
            - Holy shit! When asked what his main research project would be (as part of his first public lecture as a professor) #Luhmann stated this: "My project: a theory of society, Duration: 30 years, Costs: zero" 
            - #Luhmann quote "I only do what is easy. ... If I falter for a moment I put the matter aside and do something else" Pg 15 "His impressive body of work was produced not in spite of the fact that he never made himself do anything he didn't feel like, but **because** of it" (pg 16) - it was fun.
            - Highly productive people deflect resistance. (pg 17) reminds me of [[Kathy Sierra]]'s #derailers in her book [[Badass]]
                - This seems to be reflected in [[Luhmann]]'s process of only working on what he wants to work on... what's flowing. 
            - A #Zettelkasten is an external [[thinking]] system
            - Luhmann was remarkable in the way he took his own thinking really seriously. I feel like in engaging with my own thinking in a paper journal and in my roamdb, I'm doing this too: taking my own thinking seriously.
        - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]] 
            - Ahrens quotes [[Neil Levy]] as writing in the **Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics** that "no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the degree to which the mind is reliant on external [[scaffolding]]." quote on pg 23, citation on pg 123 
            - "#[[thinking]], reading, [[learning]], understanding, and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research, or writes." pg 23. But what does [[GOOD [[thinking]]]] look like and what of those who write to influence others, or to garner [[attention]] or [[power]]? Or in the case of folks like Hannity and Bannon, to spread disinformation. this last chunk comes up in our conversations on #wednesdaycall sometimes. Often this comes out as a declaration about "people" and how they don't want to know. I wish we could get more nuanced on the groups and states of those who don't want to know reality. The declaration doesn't sit well with me. Isn't there a term for this? [[collective willful ignorance]] or something like that. 
        - [[Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have]]
            - Ahrens references DeBono's hats but doesn't include a specific reference. Only pointer available is on page 28 where he shares a creative constraint faced by NASA and Russian space engineers of designing a writing instrument for use in the absence of gravity (duh, a pencil!). De Bono, 1998, 141 is only clue. Just did a quick search of web and found out that #DeBono coined the term [[lateral [[thinking]]]]. De Bono has quite a few books on [[thinking]] and [[creativity]].
