    - ## **Agenda for today**
        - **Section 1 Writing task** 
            - Pick from any of the prompts below, and write for 20 minutes. 
                - {{[[POMO]]: 20}}
                - Reflection on first reading phase of the book 
                    - What ideas resonate with you from the book
                        - What is the gist of the book? 
                    - Discuss the fleeting note phase
                        - What does the concept of fleeting notes mean to you? 
                        - Define a fleeting note in your own words. 
                            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] are a way to remind yourself of all those fleeting thoughts you have while reading a text, listening to a podcast, watching a video etc. 
                            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] are like stepping stones towards literature and permanent notes. While processing them they should be thrown away if not worthy or transferred to literature or permanent notes if worthy.
                        - How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method.
                            - Want to order a "small" Notebook to hold on to all of my #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                                - It should be used just for that and nothing more. 
                                - Right now i put them into my general Notebook which is also used for structuring my work day, writing down Notes for work and so on... 
                                - The problem with my current method is that i am not taking my time to process any of my fleeting notes. Maybe it's because of that multiple usage of my notetaking space. 
                            - Also want to establish a digital Notetaking Space designed just for my #[[Fleeting Notes]]. A lot of people are using [Drafts App](https://getdrafts.com/) because it's blazing fast and easy to use. 
                        - What is the value of fleeting notes? For this book, and for previous books you have read? 
        - **Section 2 Breakout rooms **
            - {{[[POMO]]: 25}}
            - Discuss your written notes, and your impressions of the book more generally.
        - **Section 3 Interview with** [[Luca Dellanna]]
        - **Section 4 Graph reflection  **
            - Explore the graph 
                - {{[[POMO]]: 6}}
            - **Group discussion**
                - What is the current state of the graph? 
                    - State of individual pages?
                    - Are we developing a writing practice? 
                    - Do we need a glossary?
                    - What needs work in the graph? 
                        - Merging pages?
                - Are beginners able to make sense of what's going on?

            - Literature note phase
                - Do we need a literature note tag?
                - Daily writing prompts to develop a practice
            -  Block referencing from the graph
                - Use Charlie's Remixer
                - Rewriting in your own words
            - Book Map
            - Meetups 
                - Proposed

    - "Define a literature note in your own words."
        - A note you take in your own words with explicit mention of where to find it in the book
    - "How do you take literature notes? Discuss your method."
        - In the current book club i will try to use the "replace with text and alias"-thing i learned a few days back.
            - "[[November 8th, 2020]] - Learned about the "replace with text and alias"-thing so i can have structured notes filled with quotes and no more huge blue text blocks in all of my literature notes."
    - "Have you found value in taking literature notes already?"
        - Unfortunately, i did not have proper time to work on my literature notes. Have some undigested ones from when i read the paperback version. 
    - "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?"
        - Right now its the time to process everything and actually take them
    - "Describe any enlightening moments you had while taking literature notes."
- [[Thoughts]] and [[Revelations]]
    - A #[[Multiplayer Roam]] that big is actually kinda slow. 
        - Is it the sheer number of people on this graph or the massive amount of notes that have to be synced? 
    - [[November 8th, 2020]] - Learned about the "replace with text and alias"-thing so i can have structured notes filled with quotes and no more huge blue text blocks in all of my literature notes.

- Literature Notes::
    - [[Introduction]]
        - The available books fall roughly into two categories. The first teaches the formal requirements: style, structure or how to quote correctly. And then there are the psychological ones, which teach you how to get it done without mental breakdowns and before your supervisor or publisher starts refusing to move the deadline once more. What they all have in common, though, is that they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper.[1] But by doing this, they ignore the main part, namely note-taking, failing to understand that improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference. #quote ^^They seem to forget that the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development.^^ This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But most of all, you can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward.[*](((baDCUDIxD)))
            - The highlighted #quote is such an important sentence so early in [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] Book. All the things you are doing **before** writing your first sentence are a catalyst of the quality and frictionlessness of the outcome

            - #todo
        - #quote ^^Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.^^ And maybe that is the reason why we rarely think about this writing, the everyday writing, the note-taking and draft-making. Like breathing, it is vital to what we do, but because we do it constantly, it escapes our attention. But while even the best breathing technique would probably not make much of a difference to our writing, any improvement in the way we organise the everyday writing, how we take notes of what we encounter and what we do with them, will make all the difference for the moment we do face the blank page/ screen‚Äìor rather not, as those who take smart notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again.

            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This idea resonated with me but i wasn't able to find any words for it. While searching through the notes of other people i found this interesting story:
                - #quote "#[[Fleeting Notes]] This reminds me of the famous [[Richard Feynman]] story - an interviewer asked him if his notes helped him to do his work and he said no, the notes ARE the work. In fact I think this story is literally in this book somewhere." [*](((DLXJ88nLd)))
