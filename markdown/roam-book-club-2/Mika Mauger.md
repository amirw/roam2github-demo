    - How to Take Smart Notes::
        - [[Introduction]]
            - Writing is essential. Note-taking is often the first step to knowledge building, be it to learn new things or to remember them. [*](((hG7TRPF5I))) 
            - Essays and books are the face of writing but note-taking is its foundations.[*](((PGX-Y4f9Y)))
            - Help books on writing often elude the necessary step before doing any writing : gathering notes and researching information. Writing a book or an essay is the outcome, not the journey.[*](((baDCUDIxD)))
            - ### "__Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.__"[*](((NOUeE9wbB))) #quote
            - Note-taking does not seem important because it is hard to tell whether we are doing it good or badly. Therefore, only when we try to assimilate information and transform it that we fail if the notes were not good enough.[*](((1NqxVWlvh))) 
            - Notes are the bases of written production : trying to fill out a blank page by retrieving information from your mind is harder than starting with notes.[*](((VQiKWP6bz))) 
            - ### "__The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.__"[*](((-AeNlDTdF))) #quote
            - ### "__What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand__"[*](((KqvBsDubC))) #quote
            - Self-control comes from the environment we are in, and we can model it to our needs.[*](((tIetkYe5Q)))
        - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
            - "Everything You Need To Know:"
                - Insight does not come easy. As it is often unexpected, planner-type people sometimes miss these opportunities.
                - But the opposite of planner-type people is not aimless-type people. People can have structure without planning.
                - Good students find themselves struggling because they are often unsatisfied of their work. #[[Imposter Syndrome]]
                - They tend to aim higher and raise an always higher bar for their standards because they know how much information there is and how little they know.
                - The other students still succeed, they do not doubt themselves or the information they know, they are often more confident.
                - The difference is : good students will become experts (always looking for something new), the others will only learn just enough to pass the exam.
            - "1.1 Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected:"
                - The habits that need to be developped are not that complex.
                - [[Getting Things Done]] might help business but not academia.
                - The little things matter. They are the necessary pieces.
            - "1.2 The Slip-box:"
                - This method has an amazing story behind. #[[Niklas Luhmann]]
                - The Zettlekasten method is a method to organise notes and ideas.
                - Simple enough to not be believable. #Ford
            - "1.3 The slip-box manual:"
                - Two slip-boxes : bibliography, notes and ideas.
                - Not sorted by topics but by ideas.
                    - e.g. idea 27/ d5g4 had a follow-up, if 27/ d5g5 existed, he would name the card 27/ d5g4a
                - The ideas then make a chain of thought rather than a pile of notes.
        - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
            - "Everything You Need To Do:"
                - If writing was divided into several tasks : final editing, making a rough draft, finding connections between ideas, etc ; each task would be relatively simple. 
                - Writing down notes is the easiest task, you just need to do it.
                - Any intellectual endeavour needs an external base as the mind cannot bear everthing.
                - The difficult tasks are the ones we do not see : thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas.
            - "2.1 Writing a paper step by step:"
                1. #[[Fleeting Notes]]
                    - every time you have an idea, just write it down, do not worry about the sorting
                2. #[[Literature Notes]]
                    - write down ideas when you read
                    - do not simply quote
                3. #[[Permanent Notes]]
                    - Turn the two first steps into relevant notes for things you are working on before you forgot what you meant.
                    - not to collect ideas but to develop them
                    - make these notes complete, auto-sufficient (no use of going back to fleeting or literature notes)
                4. Add them to your Slip-Box
                    - link these notes to the ideas that relate to them
                    - you need to be sure that you will find this note again when you will need it
                5. Consolidate your Slip-Box
                    - Look into it and take the idea you would want to develop
                    - do not think too hard on what to focus on
                        - just follow the momentum
                    - if you are interested in a topic, you will always find things to add
                    - and the more you add notes, the more you will be able to develop the idea
                6. Try to write and put order
                    - as the ideas and notes accumulate, you can see which are relevant or redundant
                    - try to use what you have rather than things you have not read, understood
                    - this is not a finish line
                7. Rough draft
                    - do not copy, try to rephrase
                    - try to assemble the information to make a coherent ensemble
                    - if you lack arguments, repeat the previous steps
                    - consolidate your argumentation
                8. Edit and proofread
                    - you have a written production
            - Be flexible, these steps are not to be done in this particular order
            - you always have several projects, chains of thought
            - even though a piece of information seems irrelevant for your production, if it is interesting, keep it, it might help you further on
            - do not let information go to waste, put it in your Slip-Box
        - [[Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have]]
            - "Everything You Need to Have::"
                - NASA story :
                    - ballpoint pen in space, put a lot of effort and succeeded in the end
                    - Russians just took pencils
                - ### "Don't complicate things unnecessarily" #quote
                - there are various techniques to write notes, synthesize information but these tend to overcomplicate how you assimilate information
                - stick to an easy structure like the Slip-Box : no need to add distractions
                - no need for new tools if they complicate the process
            - "3.1 The Tool Box::"
                - The inbox #[[Quick Capture]]
                    - all of your fleeting notes need to be put somewhere you would go back to within a day ideally
                    - no friction is necessary because this is where you put ideas when they pop up
                    - as simple as a pen and a notebook
                    - these notes are here just to remind you of the idea, no need for sentences or sources, etc.
                - Reference system
                    - Zotero recommended
                    - it is just to keep track of sources and literary notes
                - Slip-box
                    - a system to store the notes
                    - either digital or paper
                    - [Zettelkasten](zettelkasten.danielluedecke.de) recommended
        - [[Chapter 4. A Few Things to Keep in Mind]]
            - Let us not be fooled by the simplicity of the tools for their use will be crucial for their success.
                - e.g. everybody knows how to blow into a flute yet playing the flute is another story
            - [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s Slip-Box is today under study because there were a lot of misconceptions
        - [[The Four Underlying Principles]]
            - [[Chapter 5. Writing is the Only Thing That Matters]]
                - The goal in academia, studies is often to pass a test. Therefore, the purpose of students are to learn enough for this particular test.
                - Instead of giving freedom to students, academia sets their limits.
                - Thus, this does not allow students to make proper research, because time-consuming and effortful for nothing in terms of results, grade-wise.
                - Instead of separating the act of writing from reading, gathering knowledge, we should aim to do everything in the goal of writing something.
                - By doing this, we do not read for the sake of reading but convinced that if we can extract information or arguments from the book/article, we can make use of it.
                - By having this ulterior motive, focus will come easier as the goal is clear.
            - [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
                - Story of the creation of containers #[[Malcolm McLean]]
                    - simple idea and concept
                    - nevertheless the results only showed when every part of the process adopted the idea
                - no structure is bound to failure
                - but everything must be kept simple and efficient
                    - no ideal sorting creates mess
                        - e.g. chronological notes without dissociation between ideas or projects
                        - e.g. making different types of notes for different contents
                - information and notes must be kept sorted and separated
                    - fleeting notes
                    - permanent notes
                    - project notes
                - first mistake : take notes of everything but not sorting them
                    - every idea is written down but they get lost or forgotten
                - second mistake : focusing only on present projects or making too many
                    - focusing on present projects limits your thoughts and ideas
                    - making too many unfinished projects becomes messy
                    - therefore just sort ideas without creating a project for the ones that go outside the box
                - third mistake : treating all notes are fleeting notes
                    - rapid mess
                - fleeting notes are always temporary solutions, because they often need context ; thus, permanent notes are necessary for posterity
                - if taken too long to transform, fleeting notes are either not understood either seen as banal
                    - the first is the loss of meaning
                    - the second is the loss of context
                - project notes are separated from the Silp-Box
            - [[Chapter 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch]]
                - Starting from scratch does not exist as everyone always has a preconception of the ideas they wish to develop
                - Making a plan for what to write means you will only question what you know but not what you will learn
                - if you make a plan before writing, it means you only use the ideas that come easily to mind, not the ones that stem out of interest and research and curiosity
                - ### "As writing has not accompanied their previous work, they have to either start with something completely new (which is risky) or retrace their ideas (which is boring)." #quote
                - if we use our brain as our source, it is neither reliable nor objective.
                - Students are told to look for a topic before doing their research, this leads to
                    - either procrastination (the topic was not interesting)
                    - frustration (the topic has no foundation or sources to comply)
                - because they were not told to sort and preserve the information and ideas they have had in their studies in a way that allows them to use it again
                - instead of choosing a topic then losing interest
                    - as soon as you lose interest : write why
                    - pick up another topic that is more interesting
                    - therefore you do not lose time thinking that the topic is not interesting, intead, you will be working on something you like
                    - this will help with insights
            - [[Chapter 8. Let the Work Carry You Forward]]
                - Making systems that help us stick to routines need a feedback loop that makes us satisfied with what we do
                    - e.g. having a reward such as watching tv after a workout is in contradiction because why not watch tv directly
                    - therefore the reward must be the pleasure of doing the action itself
                    - if we maintain an environment of positive rewards while doing the tasks we want to do, the virtous circle is inevitable
                - the linear way of writing and giving the assignment only when it is done is detrimental for the feedback loop is too long
                    - therefore the feedback loop must be quick : the Slip-Box system lets feedback at every step of the way, then it is easier to correct our mistakes
                    - e.g. if you do not understand your Fleeting notes when you look them up again, that means that you must put more care into them
                    - e.g. if you tend to forget quickly and cannot put what you have read in your own words, you must focus more and try to find the important information and so on
                - the brain retains information easier when it is not isolated, therefore when connections already exist, it is easier to learn these things
                - Not only information is easier to learn, it is also easier to regurgitate it.
        - [[The Six Steps to Successful Writing]]
            - [[Chapter 9. Separate the Interlocking Tasks]]
                - "9.1 Give Each Task Your Undivided Attention:"
                    - Our attention span has declined for the last few decades
                    - it is therefore something to watch out for
                - "9.2 Multitasking is not a good idea:"
                    - Multitasking is very bad.
                        - People who do tend to think they get better and are more productive
                            - yet it is not the case
                        - it even worsen your ability to focus because the mind actually cannot focus on two things at the same time, it goes from one to the other very quickly
                        - therefore, when you multitask, you tire your mind
                    - ### "We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill." #quote
                    - different kinds of focus :
                        - the [[Flow]]
                        - focused attention
                        - sustained attention
                            - this one have shrunk these last few decades but can be worked on
                    - the environment in which we work has an impact on the work we do
                    - practice is necessary to outweight these difficulties
                - "9.3 Give Each Task the Right Kind of Attention:"
                    - Writing is not a unique task, it is actually several regrouped in one :
                        - proofreading
                        - outlining
                        - formulating
                        - etc.
                    - The same goes for reading and slipboxing
                    - Every one of these tasks require a different kind of focus or attention as they do not accomplish or require the same processes
                    - flexible minds are better rewarded as they can mix concentration with creativity
                    - not only the minds need to be flexible but also the environment in which they work, otherwise, these minds cannot fully express themselves.
                - "9.4 Become an Expert Instead of a Planner:"
                    - cycling metaphor :
                        - either embrace the possibility of failure (by removing the extra wheels)
                        - either stick to given steps (keeping them)
                    - study on teachers and experts
                        - teachers stick to the rules they teach and only understand things through them
                        - experts have internalised the rules and also rely on gut, experience
                            - they are confident in their knowledge, therefore they can choose more wisely what to do next instead of following a step-by-step guide
                    - the slip-box is not a set of rules but a structure in which you are free to do any task in any order
                - "9.5 Get Closure:"
                    - we can only focus on 5-7 things at the same time
                    - therefore we must use our short-term memory accordingly
                    - things are better memorised when they are understood or form connections
                    - instead of clogging our short-term memories with ideas or thoughts we deem even in the slightest interesting, we should clear the way by writing them down
                    - and we need to trust ourselves that this information will be taken care of later on
                    - then, the short-term memory will erase that idea to make space for other things
                    - trust the structure
                    - instead of thinking of unfinished thoughts or problems, the mind needs to focus on the task at hand
                - "9.6 Reduce the Number of Decisions:"
                    - after focus and short-term memory, the third tool is motivation or sheer will
                    - we need motivation to make decisions
                    - this motivation power is however like a battery that is drained troughout the day
                    - therefore, the more the day has gone, the less energy we have to make decisions
                    - then, we should limit the number of "useless" decisions e.g. choosing our clothes in the morning, or in this case, choosing how notes should be taken
                    - moreover, taking pauses is far from detrimental, it is sometimes required for the brain to assimilate what he has learnt
            - [[Chapter 10: Read for Understanding]]
                - "10.1 Read With a Pen in Hand:"
                    - The problem most students that follow study guides face is the fact that they do not take taking notes as a necessary step and thus do it like a chore
                    - What must be understood is that note-taking is the essence of the slip-box
                    - no note-taking means no permanent notes meaning no slip-box
                    - reading must in consequence be done with the intention of making notes and from these make permanent ones
                    - if not, reading would not be as useful
                    - difference between typing and note-taking by hand :
                        - both are at the same level when it comes to learnt facts
                        - however, in terms of understanding, taking notes by hand is better
                            - it is explained by the fact that writing by hand is much slower and cannot be done to write down as much details as typing. therefore, to compensate, notes by hand need to be more encompassing
                - "10.2 Keep an Open Mind:"
                    - One of the traps a mind can fall into is the confirmation bias
                        - the mind will favour the ideas and arguments that will be in line with what it already knows or thinks
                    - the mind is lazy and will do anything to seek things that are easier to comprehend
                    - Therefore, during note-taking, it is important not to dismiss information or ideas that seem to be in contradiction with one's beliefs 
                        - for it is sometimes this type of information that will lead to better understanding and judgement
                    - the richer the slip-box, the better it is to find contradicting ideas as it lets us develop the ideas we already have
                    - when writing occurs following a study guide, the main idea is set at the beginning, therefore when comes research, only information that will put forward arguments in favour will be retained
                    - papers with only pros is not interesting, a discussion is a must
                    - the choice of information must be done concerning whether it is relevant or not, not whether it is against or in favour of what we have found thus far
                - "10.3 Get the Gist:"
                    - Recognising and finding patterns in what we read is a skill to hone
                        - as it inevitably helps us better understand what we read
                    - Nonetheless, this skill can only be developed by doing it, thus by reading and taking notes
                    - the quicker and better you understand something you read, the clearer your understanding will be
                    - this can also develop thinking, writing and speaking skills as they are interlaced
                    - this lets you express yourself clearer and better explain concepts
                - "10.4 Learn to Read:"
                    - Another trap we often fall into is thinking that familiarity is understanding
                    - indeed, when we reread a piece of information, we tend to consider it as known as the mind remembers it
                    - by thinking that this piece of information is already known, the feeling of satisfaction comes up and stops us from going further
                    - to learn something, we need to test ourselves not reread
                - "10.5 Learn by Reading:"
                    - The brain is like a muscle that needs exercise and effort to develop
                        - this is relatively new
                    - therefore, if one wants to learn, one must make the efforts to do so, no one can do it for you
                    - the problem with how school works today is that everything is categorised in a way that the student do not need to make the effort
                        - by wanting to facilitate learning, teachers might be doing the contrary by letting students easily slack off learning
                        - as it is easier to cram information before a test and has shown its efficacy for the system they are in
                    - rereading has no effects on learning as it requires no effort at all, the same goes for cramming
                    - exercise might have more benefits as it relieves the brain from stress 
                    - testing yourself is the way to go
                    - elaboration is a method that involves trying to look at the big picture and explain everything about it
                    - making mistakes then understanding them is how learning should be taught
            - [[Chapter 11. Take Smart Notes]]
                - 11.0
                    - The difference between good and okay researchers lie in their ability to look beyond the text they are reading
                        - this means that they go beyond the sole context given by the text and they do not limit their view and opinions on the information they have in front of them
                    - This lack of abstraction makes it difficult for ideas to interact between themselves
                    - this also applies to note-taking e.g. if one were only to pull out quotes from texts, later on, these quotes would lose their meaning as they lost their context
                        - it is therefore important for researchers to note down the ideas and understand them by linking them to previous findings and ideas, that way, the text does not become a cage but rather another piece of the puzzle
                - "11.1 Make a Career One Note at a Time::"
                    - Contrarly to fiction writing, academic or non-fiction writing cannot be measured like pages per day as there is researching, reading that inevitably need to be done
                    - Some theses are left unfinished because disserting is not as simple as writing a page per day
                    - It is therefore better to measure research as notes per day as it builds the necessary ideas that will help once the writing process starts
                - "11.2 Think Outside the Brain::"
                    - the purpose of writing down the processes that lead to a certain idea is not only to have a record of these processes but it is the process in itself
                        - indeed, the mind works very weirdly as it does not usually focus on one thing at a time, rather it connects to everything it thinks to be useful
                        - therefore, writing down these connections and ideas helps the writer to better assess what is going on
                    - Thus the importance of having an external way of thinking : writing
                    - The brain thinks, connects but does not necessarily retain the thinking or the connections
                - "11.3 Learn by not Trying::"
                    - Remembering everything is ludicrous and not that useful
                        - e.g. Shereshevsky
                            - case of someone that could remember every bit of information (every word from a book or a conversation)
                            - problems he encountered
                                - his mind would let out a lot of memories at the same time just by the connection they had with a single word
                                    - he was easily overwhelmed by information
                                - he could not deeply understand what he learnt about
                                    - he did not understand poetry or literature as for him, it would only be a series of words
                        - What this case has shown is :
                            - the mind has the ability of inhibiting information, ability this man lacked
                                - by hiding information, the mind would only filter what was relevant and not all the details
                                - learning means retrieving information, but the relevant one
                    - common misconception in teaching : storage strength versus retrieval strength
                        - the human mind can store so much information ; a lifetime of it
                        - nonetheless, it is heavily filtered and sometimes requires effort to retrieve any information
                        - cramming again is nonsensical
                    - knowledge that is understood is more easily retained
                        - e.g. difference between veins and arteries
                            - if we say that veins have this and that as characteristics, it would not help retain the information but if the why is explained, more connections will be built
                    - learning random information is harder, thus information that connects with what we already know is easier to comprehend hence to learn
                        - the example of memory artists is not an exception because they often associate these random pieces of information with other things that connect with each other using specific techniques
                    - do not try to organise information, try to connect it
                - "11.4 Adding Permanent Notes to the Slip - Box::"
                    - when adding notes to the slip-box : 
                        - connect, link and index
            - [[Chapter 12. Develop Ideas]] 
                - 12.0
                    - not defining order does not mean chaos
                    - by building up little by little the slip-box instead of defining in advance the topics, the system naturally grows and the ideas are not there to fill gaps but to develop themselves
                    - the goal is not to cover everything but to develop things that interest us
                    - build the slip-box for the sake of better arguments not more arguments
                - "12.1 Develop Topics:"
                    - keywords (or tags) are important to find a set of information again
                    - nevertheless, these tags must be thought through, one or two is sufficient so the choice is crucial
                    - for the tags, do not think in terms of how to summarize the note but rather when would it be relevant to find this note again
                - "12.2 Make Smart Connections:"
                    - Index cards are needed to give entry points as the slip-box gets more complex
                    - note-to-note links are important as they make it possible to link seemingly different topics and as the links increase, some connections might show up
                    - making these connections and links helps to structure the slip-box and therefore help your future self in his future inquiries 
                - "12.3 Compare, Correct and Differentiate:"
                    - the slip-box does not offer redundance but renewal
                    - when a seemingly new idea comes into light and was actually already in the slip-box, confrontation, comparison is possible and therefore adds to the complexity of the problem
                    - rather than having only the ideas of your short-term memory, the slip-box lets you argue with the knowledge you have amassed until now
                    - this makes it possible to develop ideas and find new ones, new questions, new answers but also update old ideas or previously unanswered questions
                - "12.4 Assemble a Toolbox for Thinking:"
                    - Learning needs understanding, understanding needs connections
                    - flashcards are better than cramming but they still lack an important aspect which is connections
                        - isolated facts are retained with more difficulty as they do not seem to be relevant to add in our knowledge
                    - therefore, long-term memory needs connections between the ideas we encounter
                    - virtuous circle of learning is set up if connections are made, more things are remembered and more things can be learnt
                    - we need to connect, elaborate, understand, recall and contextualise
                - "12.5 Use the Slip - Box as a Creativity Machine:"
                    - Ideas do not come suddenly, they are often the result of a long thought process
                    - the more you are familiar with a concept or problem, the more you will likely see the improvements or differences between possible answers
                    - as you become used to tackling the same problem, you are more skillful with the tools you have at hand, you can tinker more freely and therefore maybe find a new combination that works
                    - therefore, being able to distinguish small differences is key as it becomes new information
                - "12.6 Think Inside the Box:"
                    - Abstraction is needed to understand complex problems and change the context
                    - because some problems can be translated in other domains, analogies can be made
                    - one of the traps the human mind fall into is only seeing what can be seen
                        - we interpret at the same time as we see/hear...
                        - e.g. the double scene in front of our nose all the time that is filled
                        - e.g. when we read, we understand the sentences, we do not look for letters, than words than build them up into sentences
                        - e.g. Abraham Wald and RAF protection for planes
                            - did not take into account the planes that did not come back
                            - the ones that came back did not suffer from lethal shots
                    - make everything simple
                        - some problems seem easy when it is not the case
                        - easy and simple are not the same
                - "12.7 Facilitate Creativity through Restrictions:"
                    - By making standards, we become more free
                    - indeed by imposing restrictions, we are able to do more within these restrictions as the energy will go into making choices but finding new ideas
                    - e.g. the alphabet, poetry
            - [[Chapter 13. Share Your Insight]]
                - 13.0
                    - writing with the slip-box means narrowing the scope and focusing on a linear topic and try to fill in the gaps of arguments
                - "13.1 From Brainstorming to Slip - box - Storming:"
                    - brainstorming is far from useful
                        - it brings up idea that are easily resurfaced not relevant ones
                        - it is even worse in groups
                    - again, the problem of choosing a topic first, then doing the research
                    - a slip-box lets arguments grow in a way that makes apparent which "paths" are more interesting, whether it is material-wise or questions-arisen-wise
                - "13.2 From Top Down to Bottom Up:"
                    - familiarity lets you develop more new ideas
                    - as you know more about a topic, the more you will be able to look into the problematic parts and not just repeat what has already been done
                - "13.3 Getting Things Done by Following Your Interests:"
                    - Not only work or studies need to be done following your interests, you must keep that interest at hand by asking yourself often whether the things you are doing are relevant or not
                    - Motivation comes from the fact that what you are studying or working on has value, is interesting
                    - therefore, it is necessary to find interest in what is being done
                - "13.4 Finishing and Review:"
                    - The problem now that the slip-box is in place is to select the best information because there is too much
                    - then, structure is quite important to fit everything in place
                    - make several projects at the same time gives you the opportunity to
                        - change projects when you are bored with one
                            - therefore, you are always working on things and not getting stuck
                        - possibly as you develop ideas in one, some will spark new ones in another and so on
                    - when you are stuck, do not stay stuck, go find another thing to do
                - "13.5 Becoming an Expert by Giving up Planning:"
                    - humans are often wrong when it comes to planning as showed by the overconfidence bar
                        - they tend to underestimate the time it takes to do certain tasks
                    - humans only learn from their mistakes when there are short feedback loops
                        - if it is missing a deadline every five months, it is harder to learn about the mistakes made as we do not know where they were
                    - the linear way of redacting a paper also tends to hide the tasks that go with it
                        - it also makes the task harder as the topic is not well-defined, when we encounter new literature, we might change the topic, think it is not a good one, etc.
                        - it is easier to say : "let me review that text and jot down some notes" than "let me continue on that paper"
                        - focusing on the final product hides the necessary steps to it
                - "13.6 The Actual Writing:"
                    - the first draft sometimes just need to be written
                    - but it also can be rewritten a number of times
                    - some passages might be bad but they can be deleted
            - [[Chapter 14. Make it a Habit]]
                - habits are the foundation of any act
                - it is hard to get rid of a habit
                - therefore, make note-taking a habit and build from that
        - [[Afterword]]
            - the educationnal system does not help learners
            - the slip-box should no be considered a part of the learner but his extent
            - the slip-box is a simple tool to do but very efficient as it grows
- **Zettels**
    - #Zettels [[Working can be explained with a physics analogy as a physical reaction : you either drain energy to make it move forward or transform it into a flow-state to make it self-renewing and even give out energy (exergonic $$\ne$$ endergonic)]]
        - #[[Literature Notes]] [Chapter 8. Let the Work Carry You forward](((RK0T2uHBh))) 
            - exergonic reactions, same as in the workspace, need energy to keep going (chores)
            - endergonic reactions do not (flow state)
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] a physics analogy can describe how I work ; precise analogies make it easier to comprehend concepts ; the flow state is opposite to doing chores
            - The fact that there's an analogy of physics
                - Because as an engineer, it reminded me of catalyst reactions
                - When you put a material that does not react, it still decelerates it
            - There's same case with how we work
                - The author brings up workflow as an analogy it helps me visualize
                    - Because if there was no analogy, it would be more difficult to understand how it all works
                        - With the analogy it's clear
            - Ideas of physics
                - The catalyst
            - Work, flow state
                - For me, the work part was more abstract than the physics part
                - I can make connections, and better understand how work can be similar to how these kinds of reactions
            - Motivation
                - The idea behind the two kinds of work-it's either in the flow state, or work while grunting
                    - Chores, not all chores

                                - slot machine like feelings when browsing on websites
                                    - voluntarily, studies are made so that scrolling on social media reenacts those feelings
                    - children and technologies
                        - the use of technologies at a young age is very common nowadays

                - Students tend to see studies as a series of tests so that they can later work with the skills they learn on the way
                - Therefore, they do not understand that what they are doing is already work and thus compartmentalize tasks
                - The same goes for writing
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] the way students are thought how they work and study seems bygone ; studies do not invite the students to learn for the sake of learning but for the sake of being tested ; intertwining learning, writing and thinking processes is key
                - Writing in academia
                    - writing tasks in academia are often seen as a task in itself
                        - and not as the result of research, understanding ideas and proposing new ones
                        - the separation of these tasks make it ever so more difficult to write
                        - as students follow study guides on linear writing, their writing tasks stay difficult as they reiterate their processes of looking for ideas, developping them
                    - learning
                        - the fact that most students only learn with the test or exam in perspective
                            - this does not teach student to make proper research
                            - they cannot develop their ideas
                        - students become lazy as they do not understand the utility in making more efforts ; looking for answers to questions that are not in the curriculum
                        - students lose their motivation as their subjects do not interest them anymore
                        - cheating
                            - with this loss of motivation, students tend to question their workflows :
                            - why work hard on retaining information that will not be useful if I can just ask a friend to give him his paper, help me during the test, even copy during the test
                            - now that some schools are working on Zoom and tests are done online, it is even easier to fall into this trap of relying on classmates to do the work or to help
                - The brain
                    - the brain does not retrieve information and chains of thoughts that easily
                        - that makes some writing superficial as the brain only brings up surface ideas, ideas that come up easily
                        - the chains of thoughts need to be at least explored to be retrieved more easily
                        - that is why writing, learning, thinking are intertwined

                - solving some key problems lead to big changes
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] basic ideas seem to carry everything, to change it is to change everything ; some simple ideas have a snowball effect when they are at the roots of a system
                - how were things transported before containers ?
                    - just packages (of different sizes and different formats : bags, crates, etc.) put on trucks
                        - the same for shipping
                    - containers are so deep-rooted in our vision of shipping that it is hard to imagine life without them
                        - base ideas seem unalterable
                            - as containers have become the basis of shipping ; to think otherwise is to completely turn the system upside down
                                - yet, it is by shaking up the way things worked that a new system was founded
                            - Jenga : if you take the bottom piece, everything just falls
                                - some ideas are like that bottom piece

                        - by changing things at the root, the repercussions can be immense

                    - solving a problem
                        - complex problems need to be split to be more easily solved
                        - e.g. road traffic -> other routes -> shipping efficiency -> shipping standards -> packaging standards -> containers

        - [[Goals for Book Club]]
            - **Meet new people**
                - I am sure to meet new people from around the world, we were 50ish in the first book club, now we are more than 200. Amazing. In addition to that, these people have something in common : Roam.
            - **Read interesting books**
                - The fact that I am building a habit of reading and apprehending non-fictionnal books early (I'm 19 years old) makes it maybe easier for them to stick. So reading these self-improvement books really inspires me.
            - **Build a habit**
                - The main goal for me is to attend all the meetings as with the winter time in Europe, these sessions are an hour earlier (9PM in France).
                - If I could tell my younger self what to do, it would be to build good habits (e.g. meditating, reading).
            - **Improve my Roam experience**
                - As I look into what this multiplayer Roam graph has to offer, I understand new concepts and I better understand old ones.
                - More experienced people share their thoughts and methods.
            - **Learn new things**
                - This is a consequence of all the goals above.
                - I am here as a learner, I want to understand.
                - Then, in the future, I will be able to teach others.

            - "Define a fleeting note in your own words. "
                - A Fleeting Note is a thought, a raw, unprocessed idea.
                - It must be a either a reminder, either the tip of the iceberg.
                - What is primordial to do is to make as many Fleeting notes as it is possible for you to process under a day. 
                - Because the issue with Fleeting Notes is 
                    - either you make too much, and you end up getting lost and unable to sort/process everything ;
                    - either you do not make enough and in this case, you might be losing ideas because you do not write them down
                - Sorting Fleeting Notes :
                    - you must process these little ideas ;
                    - indeed, they will become Permanent Notes, so their context is crucial
                    - that is why they are to be sorted as fast as possible
                    - because if you do not understand them anymore or they seem banal, 
                        - that means that they have lost their meaning or context 
                - "How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method."
                    - I simply read the book and when I felt like I was taking too much information at the same time, I would write little sentences to summarize what I just read
                    - Nevertheless, I do not know if I have made too many or too little Fleeting/Literary Notes
                        - What is the difference between them ?

            - As the number of people using the graph has tremendously increased from the first book club, how do we do to sort information ?
                - Doesn't information become redundant when fifty people comment on the same ideas ?
                - Isn't it more time-consuming and sometimes effortful to read fifty comments just to find out that everyone understood the same things but phrased it differently ?
                - Therefore, how do we choose which comments are the ones that will make our understanding evolve ?

            - "How do you take literature notes? Discuss your method."
                - What I do is I read a whole section or chapter, then I put everything that caught my attention into sentences
                - Nevertheless, sometimes I do forget some things and need to read a bit to just refresh my memory
                    - I do not need to read entire paragraphs, some words sometimes suffice to remember the idea
                - The problem with my method is that I tend to only write ideas and not references, maybe I should do that ?
            - "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?"
                - I did not know the difference between Fleeting Notes and Literature Notes at first.
                    - I only wrote down some notes about what I read and this turned out to be Literature Notes
                    - Fleeting Notes are really ideas on a whim
                - Therefore, I directly started making literature notes from the beginning
                - the other struggle is the time that it takes to make such notes, there is effort of reformulating
                - I am not an adept reader and therefore note-taker, maybe that has to do with it too
                - The more I read from the book, the better I understand how important it is to read, take notes and gather knowledge in this way.

                - "Reflect on the book.  What are you impressions? "
                    - I only had the time to read through it once but I think that I have learnt some very useful ideas concerning learning and writing.
                    - The various examples and studies are very interesting each time and really show how learning and teaching methods nowadays are outdated
                - "Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way? "
                    - they may have not really helped me understand, but more about having a clear summary of what I've learnt
                - "Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? "
                    - I think that I have a relatively tight schedule these days but I had done my notes in my first read so I'm right on time.
                - "How is your progress towards your initial goals? Or have they changed?"

                        - I have not begun and I do not know where to begin : should I pick an idea and start from there ? what if I choose a first idea but there is a more general one overlaying it ? how condensed should an idea in a zettle be ?
                    - "What are you unsure about? "
                        - I have looked through the original slip-box and did not find the answers to my questions :
                            - what is a first root idea with which to begin with ?
                            - should I create a topic e.g. __Art__ ? or an idea like __Art is X__ ?
