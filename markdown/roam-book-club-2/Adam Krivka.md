    - [[Questions for SÃ¶nke]]
        - How do you see the **world in 10+ years** when the **Zettelkasten** mindset has been **well established**? Maybe in a similar way the shipping container is now widely used, what will "widely used Zettelkasten" look like?
    - [[[[Goals of Book Club]]]]:
        - bad
            - Reconnect with the ideas
        - good
            - individual
                - actually start a morning writing practice
                - decide whether I want to meticulously keep a # evergreen on the start of every page or just do it anarchistically
                - actually come up with a topic I care about and start thinking about it in Zettel kasten
                    - maybe try to answer the question:
                        - how to integrate note-taking and spaced repetition?
            - collective
                - figure out best practices on how to do multiplayer Roam
                - collect suggestions for improvements and send them all to the Roam team
            - random
                - meet someone new, make a friend
