- #Chat [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] Here are the guidelines for "chat" threads: #guidelines
    1. a chat thread is just a string of sequential comments from different users, that are readable from top to bottom, in the same time-ordered way that you might read a book or play.
        - (we recommend that, by default, that comments in a chat be indented to the same level, 
            - but if you want to clearly indicate that a comment is a detail or an aside, it can make sense to indent, like this- 
            - but kindly DO continue to follow the "time-ordering principle", so that the points still "scroll" downwards in temporal order, from first at top, to most recent-in-time, at the bottom.)
    2. anyone can start a chat, in any of the "writeable pages" in the graph (i.e. daily notes pages, and each of us in our own pages) - but to make it "query"-able, please include [[Chat]] or #Chat in its block header, and then indent one level to start writing ... one comment or idea = one "block"
    3. consider **adding subject hashtags  to the "header line"** if you want - this is super helpful in "surfacing" and "finding " the chat later.
    4. if you want to comment on something higher in thread, **use a "block reference"** so that your comment will still appear in chronological order
        - Then, the little number floating next to the block-that-you-referenced, will show that someone responded to it. 
        - for added clarity, the hashtag #in-response-to may also be useful, as in
            - "point A I am making"
            - "point B I am making"
            - this is #in-response-to ""point A I am making""
    5. for clarity, we suggest you denote change-of-speaker by writing [[your name]].
        - you can "namespace it" and then only your initials will be visible (go to "user settings" to cycle the namespace view appropriately). Example: [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]
            - If you have a long name, I recommend you use a TextExpander and hotkey your nametag to a shortened key combo (mine is `,,me`)
    6. if you want to be helpful to people who wander in later to know when the conversation happened, consider date and time-stamping your chats. 
        - If you are using a text expander program time- and date- stamping can also be "hotkeyed"
    7. if a chat is clearly a SUBtopic of another topic, consider using #sub in the header line
        - this allows for a filtered view of "main topics only" from the # `chat` home page.
    8. **ADVANCED CHAT ADVICE:**
    9. If you want to be considerate of other users in the graph if many are active at the same time, click the little dot for the bullet and choose "focus on block" whenever you want to type into a block.
        - If you do that, your typing will not disturb other people's view, nor can they type into the block that you are writing into. 
    10. Note that one challenge is when more than one person are typing into a conversation at the same time - it can be hard to keep everything sequenced in temporal order while more than one are typing, but taking a moment to move blocks back into temporal order if they fall "out of order" -
        - that helps people to read the conversation later.
