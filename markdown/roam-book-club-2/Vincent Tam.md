    - [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
        - [[Goals for Book Club]]
            - Improve my process to make the most of my reading / research / writing, and make more interdisciplinary connections.
            - Get exposure to best practices.
            - Connect with others.
            - Explore what's possible with Roam.
    - [[Live Session 7]] on [[December 13th, 2020]]
        - "The book promotes a bottom up approach to note taking, which we have used in Book Club. Reflect on this. How did this feel? "
            - A note-taking system built bottom-up is a more accurate and authentic reflection of the totality of your interests and experiences rather than a top-down decision or plan made at one discrete moment in life that dictates a disproportionate amount of time.
        - "Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?"
            - Writing as the medium of thought
            - More elaboration rather than merely highlighting or copying quotes
            - Leaning into the discomfort of gaps in understanding
            - Actually learning rather than merely feeling like you're learning
            - Slower and deeper reading
        - "Reflect on Roam Book Club"
            - I've been behind on this book club due to a big move. Still working on permanent notes. The experience has been way more time-intensive than I expected but also super worthwhile. Building good practices have short-term costs but long-term benefits. For example, leaning into the discomfort of gaps in your understanding so you actually move forward in your thinking rather than just feeling like it. Anyway, I want to encourage anyone who's not caught up to stick with it and keep going. 
- Literature Notes::
    - [[Introduction]]
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Sönke Ahrens opens the book with a quote from Neil Levy about the need to "understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding" for intellectual endeavors. I really like the metaphor of external scaffolding for the mind in relation to notes and writing. I'm reminded of how much easier long division is on paper or a whiteboard versus in your head. How much more potent and expansive would our thinking be with external scaffolding? [*](((hG7TRPF5I)))
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] So true. Our notes aren't the final written product, but they do make up much of the writing we do. The final product wouldn't be possible without the information gathering, processing, and thinking during note-taking. [*](((PGX-Y4f9Y)))
        - Note-taking, although underemphasized, is the most important part of writing because it's where idea development occurs. [*](((baDCUDIxD)))
        - The book teaches a practice for building a system of connected notes that enables better and more enjoyable writing, learning, and creative work. [*](((baDCUDIxD)))
        - Learning and research happen **through** writing. [*](((NOUeE9wbB)))
        - Upstream improvements in everyday note-taking produce immense gains downstream when writing a paper. [*](((NOUeE9wbB)))
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Feedback provides the information required for progress. The shorter the feedback loop, the better. [*](((1NqxVWlvh)))
        - We don't realize we're doing something poorly without feedback. There's no immediate feedback for bad note-taking, so it's difficult to know it needs improvement and how to achieve that improvement. [*](((1NqxVWlvh)))
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Compounding is one of the greatest forces in the universe. [*](((VQiKWP6bz)))
        - Establishing an everyday practice of compounding our knowledge pays off immensely when we apply it to writing a paper. [*](((VQiKWP6bz)))
        - The conventional approach to writing involves putting the thoughts in our mind into written form. This is much easier if we've already done it as an everyday note-taking practice and just need to fit it into a new context. [*](((VQiKWP6bz)))
        - A good note-taking practice leads to better and easier-to-write papers.   [*](((-AeNlDTdF)))
        - The key to good writing comes from the preparation of a note-taking practice. [*](((-AeNlDTdF)))
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Your rate of change matters more  than where you are. [*](((KqvBsDubC)))
        - How you do your work is the most important determinant of academic success. [*](((KqvBsDubC)))
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Good outcomes often result from focusing on long-term interests over short-term rewards. [*](((KqvBsDubC)))
        - Our self-control and discipline depend not so much on us, but on the environment, which we can alter to our favor. [*](((tIetkYe5Q)))
        - Eliminate conflicts between long and short-term interest by doing work you genuinely enjoy. By also defining and structuring the work well, you can succeed without relying on willpower. [*](((tIetkYe5Q)))
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - [[Everything You Need To Know]]
            - A good structure provides the freedom for you to follow your bliss in your work. [*](((59-bYYcu-)))
            - A good system for capturing thoughts eliminates the overhead of memory and organization, freeing mental resources to focus on the content. [*](((N9B8GYzJr)))
            - Even with freedom to pursue our interests, poor work routines can lead to issues with procrastination and motivation. Good structure prevents this and provides the freedom to follow our bliss in our work. [*](((lz_jy3Uyg)))
            - Develop an antifragile workflow that benefits from new insights and discoveries. Rigid plans struggle to adapt to new information. [*](((e5t8EGtoY)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] In [[Finite and Infinite Games]], [[James Carse]] makes the distinction between finite and infinite players. Finite players play within boundaries, try to minimize the unexpected, and play to reach some preferred predicted outcome — much like the "planners" here who try to stick to the script and get to end of their studies. Infinite players play with boundaries, embrace surprise, and find joy in the journey rather that the destination — much like the "experts" here who get genuine joy in the learning process and discovering new insights. [*](((Afolfm8fD)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Innovation happens at the edges. [*](((GgF6t07Z4)))
            - Knowledge is partitioned up to make teaching easier. In reality, everything is connected. True knowledge is interdisciplinary. Progress happens at the edges. [*](((GgF6t07Z4)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] In an interview [(link)](https://medium.com/s/workflow/kevin-kelly-writes-to-find-out-what-he-doesnt-know-658ae1df1ae2) with [[Steven Johnson]], [[Kevin Kelly]] says "I write primarily to find out what I’ve been thinking, and I don’t know until I write it." [*](((Y0L49bjII)))
            - Sönke Ahrens opens the book quoting Niklas Luhmann: “One cannot think without writing.” [*](((Y0L49bjII)))
        - [[1.1 Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected]]
            - People try to break down complexity by sorting into folders and categories. Premature structure can lead to information silos and stovepipes that hampers innovation, which often emerges precisely from cross-domain connections. [*](((FfwvQnsGs)))
            - Complexity is best handled by following a few simple principles. [*](((vhg4vhrk2)))
            - GTD (Getting Things Done) uses an inbox approach to collect tasks in one place for processing. [*](((ngW0psLUC)))
            - Offload mental overhead processes and focus on only the task at hand. [*](((ngW0psLUC)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[Steven Johnson]]'s "slow hunch" [*](((PxFYE_wSD)))
            - Successful organization requires a holistic approach that takes care of everything to prevent anything neglected from becoming an issue later. [*](((1OmI74xT0)))
        - [[1.2 The Slip-box]]
            - Abstract an idea from the original context into a general principle with broader application. [*](((BjFRHwXXy)))
            - The slip-box is not merely a repository of knowledge but a dialogue partner capable of generating new ideas. [*](((BjFRHwXXy)))
            - Luhmann was productive despite never forcing himself in any task, always following his bliss. When he faced resistance, he simply worked on something else. [*](((j6EyoD7pi)))
            - When your process allows your work to aligned with your interests and energy in the moment, you become more productive than if you have to coerce yourself. [*](((7HSDsXHqL)))
            - Don't get anchored to your initial idea when you write. [*](((oz882t9yv)))
            - With a process that adapts to change, work becomes almost effortless because it stays aligned with our interests and motivation. [*](((oz882t9yv)))
            - Success comes not from having the willpower to overcoming resistance, but from creating environments that avoid it. [*](((hhTaHBEnz)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] We overglorify people who do things in their head without the assistance of tools. However, humanity has progressed as far as we have because of our tools. [*](((_4c4iQ4E2)))
            - A good note-taking system must help extend our thinking, organize our knowledge, and integrate well in our daily routines. [*](((_4c4iQ4E2)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] True understanding requires a holistic perspective that extends beyond a reductionist focus on individual parts. [*](((j85ILtzRh)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] “Take a simple idea and take it seriously.” - [[Charlie Munger]] [*](((j85ILtzRh)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Small improvements compound over time into large gains, especially when applied at industrial scale. [*](((lMo5zp36O)))
        - [[1.3 The slip-box manual]]
            - First step: simply write brief notes labeled with reference information. (Luhmann’s bibliographical slip-box) [*](((nN5f1vjN_)))
            - Second step: revisit the initial notes and write a new note per idea on the significance beyond the original context. (Luhmann’s main slip-box) [*](((55MjPqvfQ)))
            - Write slip-box notes in full sentences with a level of refinement such that they can be dropped directly into a final piece. [*](((zt7lrN7X2)))
            - Build on previous slip-box notes and make connections. [*](((zt7lrN7X2)))
            - Rather than merely highlighting or copy quotes, write notes in your own words that distill the reading into general principles applicable across context. [*](((iKecBcypp)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Avoid top-down hierarchical organization like categorical sorting that can impose premature structure and hinder connection and interaction between notes. [*](((U4Q7m4mQO)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The power isn't in the knowledge of individual notes but the connections between them. [*](((LAHvoWGna)))
            - When add a new note, also make connections to related notes. [*](((LAHvoWGna)))
            - Allow organization to emerge from the bottom-up by adding a topic note containing sorted links to relevant notes. [*](((k1R5hvOJl)))
            - Have an index referencing one or two notes that are good entry points into a line of thought or topic. [*](((gq3S3MuUq)))
            - We can use tools for thought to complement the limitations of the brain just like we use tools that complement our physical limitations to extend our abilities. [*](((kVuIQFmCg)))
    - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
        - [[Everything You Need To Do]]
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] When we see a path to the goal, when we've done a substantial amount of work already, it's easy to find the motivation to finish. [*](((X7Ji9CUKq)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Zoom out in order to see the forest from the trees. [*](((gG5gSVgXN)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The most important part is having the notes to start from. While it's possible to start writing notes with the goal of producing a paper, a more natural approach is making an everyday habit of write notes on your interests and formatting them into a paper when you want to communicate something. [*](((Gw15Dgxwj)))
            - Notes are merely the tangible outcome of the primary work of reading, thinking, and understanding. [*](((RN5JKBqxJ)))
            - "#[[Fleeting Notes]] In an interview [(link)](https://medium.com/s/workflow/kevin-kelly-writes-to-find-out-what-he-doesnt-know-658ae1df1ae2) with [[Steven Johnson]], [[Kevin Kelly]] says "I write primarily to find out what I’ve been thinking, and I don’t know until I write it." [*](((Y0L49bjII)))" [*](((RN5JKBqxJ)))
            - To understand something, you have to write and encode it in your own words. [*](((RN5JKBqxJ)))
            - Writing helps immensely with learning and thinking by exercising your knowledge and insisting that your thoughts make sense. [*](((RN5JKBqxJ)))
        - [[2.1 Writing a paper step by step]]
            - Capture ideas that pop into your head in fleeting notes for processing later. [*](((pZ1dkTn5N)))
            - While reading, write literature notes on what you want to remember or use in your writing. Write full sentences in your own words. Be brief and selective. [*](((eRojO1adJ)))
            - Before you forget what they mean, take your fleeting and literature notes and write permanent notes on how they relate to your research and interests. [*](((y5dDNqTm7)))
            - A permanent note should be about how the new information supports, contradicts, or develops other ideas —including any arising questions or lines of thought. [*](((y5dDNqTm7)))
            - Focus each permanent note on a single idea. Write concisely in full sentences like you would to another person and include references. [*](((DC7zUzXbl)))
            - Only the permanent notes in the slip-box matter. Fleeting notes get thrown away, and literature notes are stored and forgotten. [*](((DC7zUzXbl)))
            - Add links to related notes in a permanent note. [*](((nQY-Lsqjm)))
            - Ensure each permanent note is accessible by linking to it from the index or an entry point that's linked to the index. [*](((nQY-Lsqjm)))
            - Develop your research and inquiries from the bottom-up using the slip-box. [*](((erCjnBgLf)))
            - Follow your interest and choose the path with the most potential insight. [*](((erCjnBgLf)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] This is a much more organic, bottom-up, and robust approach. [*](((erCjnBgLf)))
            - Rather than brainstorming for a topic, look for where notes are clustering and allow your interests to change. [*](((erCjnBgLf)))
            - Encourage serendipity by writing notes on the information we stumble on, since accidental encounters make up most of what we learn. [*](((EegQ1h74c)))
            - Every note added based on our interest is another building block toward work we haven't even anticipated yet. [*](((6mdYRieSi)))
    - [[Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have]]
        - [[Everything You Need to Have]]
            - The slip-box removes obstructions to the primary task of thinking by compensating for the brain's limitations in information storage and providing an external structure to think in. [*](((vbI8TekIe)))
        - [[3.1 The Tool Box]]
            - Fleeting notes are reminders of a thought, not the entire thought. They should be processed soon and tossed. [*](((SkzQQNXXK)))
            - The reference system holds literature notes taken during reading along with reference information. [*](((xvdWq2okr)))
    - [[Chapter 4. A Few Things to Keep in Mind]]
    - [[The Four Underlying Principles]]
        - [[Chapter 5. Writing is the Only Thing That Matters]]
            - If you don't write an idea down, you might as well not have had it. [*](((5Bxb_J2dj)))
            - Writing is how research is done and communicated, and studying is itself independent research, so writing is all that matters. [*](((U0_AKhDHt)))
            - A focus on writing encourages reading and learning with an eye toward open questions, which are the only questions worth writing about. [*](((9LdD6VzxA)))
            - A focus on writing encourages engaged reading because you have to understand to write. [*](((9LdD6VzxA)))
            - Even if you don't write to publish, a focus on writing will improve your reading and thinking. [*](((9LdD6VzxA)))
        - [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
            - Often an idea is both powerful and overlooked due to its simplicity. [*](((Zo2Uaa6y3))) 
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Optimize with a holistic perspective on the entire system rather than a narrow reductionist focus on an individual part. [*](((9eRcB8Tey)))
            - Note-taking with a common system prevents scattered notes that require additional mental overhead to manage. [*](((iEoGjCKxY)))
            - Tag your notes based on how you want to find them later rather than the context or category they appear in now. [*](((qjApgS0oM)))
            - A top-down system gets messier over time as you try to fit more information into a structure that does not adapt. A bottom-up system grows more powerful over time as additional notes create unexpected connections and structure emerges organically. [*](((EVjA9eABJ)))
            - A top-down system helps you narrowly find things you specifically search for. The slip-box helps you discover related knowledge you've forgotten. [*](((EVjA9eABJ)))
            - A separation of fleeting, permanent, and project notes is required to ensure a useful slip-box and prevent dilution of the necessary critical mass of quality notes. [*](((j2y4NdvQj)))
            - Fleeting notes are reminders of information that will be processed shortly and thrown away. [*](((BL5wHnXDF)))
            - Permanent notes contain information to be understandable on their own and are meant to be evergreen. [*](((SWKiDesb1)))
            - Project notes are only relevant to a particular project and can be archived after completion. [*](((yBtPTbb0b)))
            - If you write every idea into a notebook, as if they're all permanent notes, you dilute the usefulness of your note-taking system with many trivial notes. Also, the chronological order of a notebook doesn't help in finding or combining ideas. [*](((7GWVsCHA5)))
            - If you collect notes in a medium specific to projects, you don't allow for ideas to connect across domains and time. [*](((HlsQj7ZDO)))
            - A permanent repository of ideas allows them to interact and develop over time and across domains. [*](((HlsQj7ZDO)))
            - If all your notes are fleeting notes that you rarely get around to processing, they become scattered and messy. [*](((V8bEn02_W)))
            - Fleeting notes are only for capturing thoughts without interrupting the moment. [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
            - Fleeting notes, like highlighting text or margin notes, don't do any elaboration. [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
            - Fleeting notes are useless if you don't process them into permanent notes. [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
            - Permanent notes are written so they are understood across context and time. [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
            - Have a low threshold for writing down fleeting notes, but process them before you forget what they mean. [*](((BRp1QJSON)))
            - Literature notes are brief since they having the reference text for context. Permanent notes are more detailed with enough information to stand alone. [*](((sA3wOx9on)))
            - Luhmann never highlighted text or wrote in the margins. He wrote notes in his own words on separate sheets of paper. [*](((sA3wOx9on)))
            - Fleeting notes are a reminder of a thought, while permament slip-box notes contain a fully elaborated thought that can become part of a future written piece. [*](((UZ4XCHfSA)))
            - The standardized format of every note allows for later recombination and negates any sorting decision. [*](((XVevLqYUv)))
            - Keep project notes separate from the slip-box. [*](((jLXwfvQda)))
        - [[Chapter 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch]]
            - The conventional top-down thinking about writing begins with a decision on the topic. [*](((s2br3-pds)))
            - Having a good topic or question to write about requires having already done some work and thinking. [*](((kvk3dCa8w)))
            - Every intellectual endeavor forms within some pre-existing context. That endeavor reshapes the context and sets the stage for subsequent endeavors. [*](((kvk3dCa8w)))
            - You can't come up with a good question to write about if you haven't already done some thinking — and thus writing — on it already. [*](((kvk3dCa8w)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Love this quote: "We will not be guided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but by our interest, curiosity and intuition, which is formed and informed by the actual work of reading, thinking, discussing, writing and developing ideas–and is something that continuously grows and reflects our knowledge and understanding externally." [*](((kvk3dCa8w)))
            - Don't make decisions based on fragile plans made by your brain in one particular moment. Rather, make better decisions based by your interests, reading, and thinking that have developed and compounded across time. [*](((kvk3dCa8w)))
            - By following your interests and writing notes along the way, good questions and topics will naturally emerge. [*](((2U8Id9Bu8)))
            - Look at where your notes are clustering to find potential topics. [*](((2U8Id9Bu8)))
            - Writing is often presented as a linear process. With the slip-box, writing becomes circular, and you'll have too many topics to write about. [*](((6ZfzhxuL5)))
            - By working with the slip-box, you have the material from previous notes to write about topics that interests you. Doing so further contributes to those areas and surfaces more questions and ideas to guide subsequent work. [*](((F-jhYj-Pz)))
            - Embrace an openness to where you end up because you can't predict where insight will lead. [*](((F-jhYj-Pz)))
        - [[Chapter 8. Let the Work Carry You Forward]]
            - Work in a manner that gathers energy like a flywheel. [*](((RK0T2uHBh)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Find joy in the journey, not the destination. [*](((RQQ2w8HSU)))
            - The work itself has to be rewarding in order to establish a postive feedback loop that pulls us forward. [*](((RQQ2w8HSU)))
            - Willpower isn't necessary when that work itself is rewarding. [*](((ZLooaikXs)))
            - Progress requires timely and specific feedback. [*](((AR7OaXAvj)))
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Good habits have present costs and future benefits. Bad habits have present benefits and future costs. ([[James Clear]]) [*](((AR7OaXAvj)))
            - Sucess and happiness require an active seeking of feedback. Protecting a self-image may prevent pain in the near-term, but we'll suffer from lack of growth in the long run. [*](((AR7OaXAvj)))
            - The best long term growth strategy is to seek out opportunities for learning and improvement. [*](((AR7OaXAvj)))
            - Smaller and more frequent feedback loops are easier to embrace than large infrequent ones. [*](((LoKPUYPOR)))
            - Writing notes in our own words while reading provides a good feedback loop by testing our understanding. [*](((XNIhRfrZU)))
            - Writing notes produces a virtuous cycle. We test our understanding when we write notes in our own words, and we get better by realizing what we missed. We also test our ability to distill out the important information, which further improves our reading. [*](((oO7Kd61Qe)))
            - We check if we've thought through our ideas while writing permanent notes. Any contradictions or inconsistencies appear when we add them to the slip-box. [*](((Xy_6Gvicd)))
            - The value of the slip-box is not merely in pulling up specific notes, but more so in discovering the network of connected ideas — and these connections increase exponentially for every note added. [*](((U0D-8ZKaX)))
            - Learning becomes easier the more connected our notes are because new information has more surface area to attach to. [*](((E6qEFWAIg)))
            - Making sense of new information is easier with a latticework of mental models versus isolated islands of knowledge. [*](((E6qEFWAIg)))
            - The slip-box and our brains use the same language and mental models, so the slip-box natural becomes a better and more dynamic collaborator than other sources. [*](((MHzKOP6xZ)))

                - Our conception of multitasking as the act of distributing attention across parallel tasks is flawed and impossible. Attention cannot be distributed. We are actually quickly switching between tasks serially, with each switch degrading our focus. [*](((5BAP8kMCx)))
                - We falsely believe we getting better at something the more times we do it. This conflation of familiarity and skill is called the mere exposure effect. [*](((AmpFHNteC)))
                - We can train our focus by not multitasking, avoiding distractions, and separating different tasks to reduce interference. [*](((FUZKBnN4G)))
                - The structure of the slip-box method complements our restless minds by harnessing our focus with writing and guiding our attention across steps in the workflow. [*](((FUZKBnN4G)))

                - For a working overview of a topic, make a new note linked to the index. As the overview on the topic evolves, make a newer note and update the link on the index. This way, structure for a topic is introduced and evolved through adding notes. [*](((WBqF2KHKp)))
                - Choose keywords based on how you want to stumble on the note again during the writing process rather than how you'd like to file it away like an archivist. [*](((37ECJavSi)))

                - In our literature notes, we decide what's noteworthy from our reading. In our permanent notes, we decide what's relevant to our work and long-term thinking. We make connections between ideas in our references across notes. Clusters naturally emerge as we use the slip-box that indicate potential writing topics. [*](((ZCuBct3ni)))
                - A developed cluster provides more surface area for new notes to connect to and attracts more ideas. They point us toward what's worth thinking about. As the slip-box grows in mass, it can complement or substitute our thoughts about what's interesting or relevant. A look at the slip-box offers a more accurate and comprehensive reflection of our thoughts and interests across time. [*](((dBAakL4ka)))

                - Questions arise from the slip-box through a process of trial and error. They've been tested against other questions and will be higher quality than those generated from a top-down process. Evolution works similarly by trial and error rather than planning. [*](((30eozOwaL))) 
                - Good questions don't just come from nowhere. To arrive at good questions, we need to work through a process of elaborating on ideas, making connections, and drawing distinctions — basically the work involved in using the slip-box. [*](((ZIzflMK1K)))
            - [[13.2 From Top Down to Bottom Up]]
                - The more familiar we are with the ideas we've encountered, the more open-minded we become. [*](((wYgj-NeXq)))
                - Being more familiar with the current state enables a more refined sense of what's actually new and different. [*](((wYgj-NeXq)))
                - Creativity correlates with familiarity in art. Innovative work is more often produced by an artist familiar with their craft rather than accidentally. [*](((eXnVlAw_T)))
                - You have to be able to see your old ways of thinking as thinking routines in order to have the perspective to change them. [*](((HGeH0pymd)))
            - [[13.3 Getting Things Done by Following Your Interests]]
                - Motivation and agency are two of most important requirements of successful learning. Motivation comes from finding meaning in the learning material and connecting it to personal goals. [*](((hKJOIwEyi)))
                - When we commit to a long-term learning project upfront without knowing what to expect, we risk losing interest. A flexible structure allows us to change coarse to maintain interest. [*](((tHtvri2mR)))
                - Elaborate on what you come across. Ask what's interesting about it and what's relevant to note. Let your interests develop and evolve over time. [*](((-Cl18HUNX)))
                - Rigid attachment to an outdated plan in an attempt to control circumstances doesn't improve control. What does work is changing direction in response to circumstances. [*](((yci8SvoAM)))
                - Be adaptive with your plan so you don't actually finalize it until the end of the project. [*](((yci8SvoAM)))
                - Our work becomes motivating when we can adapt it toward what's interesting and relevant. We then rely much less on willpower, which isn't sustainable. [*](((I6Gh5naNy)))
            - [[13.4 Finishing and Review]]
                - Have a flexible structure for the draft. Importantly, decide what doesn't need to go in a particular section because it has a place elsewhere. [*](((HPsszNE2F)))
                - The slip-box is particularly helpful for multiple concurrent writing projects. The by-products of one project inevitably feed into other projects or additional notes for the slip-box. [*](((TNNxdmyUe)))
                - Luhmann was so productive because he only worked on what flowed well rather than what required forcing. [*](((2WQrQNiI-)))
                - Don't work against resistance; redirect it toward other possibilities provided by the slip-box. [*](((2WQrQNiI-)))
            - [[13.5 Becoming an Expert by Giving up Planning]]
                - Be wary of planning, especially when it's focused on the outcome without accounting for the process and intermediate steps. [*](((i-J1kvZAs)))
                - In sports, visualizing being the winner doesn't help but visualizing the training does. [*](((i-J1kvZAs)))
                - We can learn from our experiences only if we get timely feedback. [*](((MF_V6jgLX)))
                - Defining a task as a series of concrete steps works much better than a vague and poorly defined goal. [*](((bNiPQ4-rD)))
            - [[13.6 The Actual Writing]]
                - Overcome inertia by starting your writing with the modest goal of writing for yourself. [*](((0907r7J3B)))
                - Eliminate what doesn't serve a purpose in your writing. Having a separate document to hold deleted material makes this easier. [*](((Gz-S3DnUJ)))
        - [[Chapter 14. Make it a Habit]]
            - Rather than attempt to use willpower to break old habits, simply try to develop new ones that can replace the old ones. [*](((4hIM0I_l_)))
            - Start a routine of making notes of what's interesting and relevant while reading. This first step makes the subsequent permanent notes and connection building much easier. [*](((4hIM0I_l_)))
    - [[Afterword]]
        - The traditional education system uses a top-down approach that structures learning into short time frames and segmented disciplines. The slip-box uses a more bottom-up approach that focuses on long-term interdisciplinary work driven by interest and desire for understanding. [*](((QVfNEbAfL)))
        - The slip-box helps decentralized our thinking in a network of ideas. Rather than approaching learning as an accumulation of knowledge, learn in order to grow as a person and in how we think by continuously evolving our thinking processes based on new information. [*](((AEToJgvmY)))
        - The slip-box process is simple: make notes while reading, turn them into permanent notes for the slip-box, and making connections between those notes. Ideas will emerge and lead to more writing. [*](((FP19rL5EA)))
