- #Chat [[Chinarut]] thanks [[Dharam Kapila]] for another awesome demo and nudging the way! Iâ€™ve been playing with the idea of indexing [my zettels]([[Chinarut/Zettels]]) to see if I could see patterns and clustering (not to mention the side-effect is linking zettels).  Roam Portal was useful in visualizing this which it a good start!  To knocking Sonkeâ€™s socks off next week with visualization! ðŸ¤¯

        - #Reply [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] Clustering, oh it's such an awesome word. I mean just think about that, without even having to categorize from the top-down, the evident patterns will reveal itself, as long as we stay the course with the creation of many-many Zettels~
