- Fleeting Notes:: 
    - Interview with Sonke
        - The relative advantage we can gain from adopting this method is that we can discover connections between ideas both old and new that we otherwise wouldn't be able to make.
        - In particular, the fact that the notes are written in stages allows us to see externally the development of our thoughts.
- Literature Notes::
- [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
    - [[Goals]]
        - I want to understand how to implement this method in my daily work, to develop a workflow for it.
        - I want to become proficient at using Roam, so that I'm comfortable with most (if not all) of its features.
- [[Questions for Sönke]]
    - How do you separate your fleeting notes and permanent notes when using Roam?
