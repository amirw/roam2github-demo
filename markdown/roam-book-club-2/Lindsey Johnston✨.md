- Week 1: [[November 1st, 2020]]
    - [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
        - [[Goals for Book Club]] How is multiplayer zetteling different to individual zetteling? 
            - Meet more fellow #roamcult members - I learn so much from everyone & consider many my friends already. We've got a sharp AF community here.
            - Test out new ways of using Roam, learn from other members processes
            - Explore various interpretations of [[Sönke Ahrens]]'s system & then dive deeper by using learnings to take notes on additional books __together__ (sub-groups within core Book Club, where we explore various topics/domains)
            - The whole idea of taking notes on a book about taking notes- talk about meta! And I am HERE for it. 
            - Serendipity generator by bringing all of our viewpoints & perspectives together to hopefully broaden my own ways of thinking
            - Push myself to really understand [[zettel]]ing on a much deeper level / a chance to explore this topic (and others) beyond simply reading the book
            - Have meaningful conversations that Spark Joy (a la Marie Kondo)
            - New systems that I can implement in my own database / process / system - or experiment with to take bits and pieces to create my own (I looove seeing unique ways others are using [[Roam]] because many are processes I would've never thought of); the diversity of this squad is the part of its beauty
            - I've never identified myself as a "writer" but again I'd like to push outside of my comfort zone in many ways- writing, note-taking, reading styles, etc.
            - USING THE WRITING PROMPT GENERATOR — soooo cool [[@Charlie M]]
        - **Charlie Mead Demo** of his new [Roam JS plugin]([[plugins/(rand)]]) to help surface blocks in Book Club graph
            - underneath [[Book Prompts]]
                - (rand)
                - change block of text to TEXT + ALIAS so you can rewrite / markup as you please
                - throw your name on the daily page, choose [[Book Prompts]], [[Writing Prompts]]
        - **Breakout Group**
            - Who was in this group on 11.1.20::
                - [[Izzy Blue]], John Guerrero, [[Brent Bitz]]
            - What did your group talk about?:: Transferring from Bullet Journaling to using Roam, monthly page setups (i.e. "October 2020")
            - Any questions for the book club as a whole?::
            - Our group question for Sönke Ahrens::
(#[[question for Soenke]])
                - How his system has changed since he wrote the book, how he's using roam, how to handle transferring
        - **Notes from Sonke Ahrens interview:**
            - surprised by how people took the book (not step-by-step system, but more EXPERIMENTAL, make it fit for your needs)
            - started as a spin off of a larger project (more theoretical thing); a procrastination project (he was stuck & this was a good way to experiment with interacting the outside world & the inner brain)
            - no book he could really recommend his students re: note taking (its so crucial & there was a huge disconnect in how it was taught)
                - teaching techniques were contradicting- start w/ your thesis/goal, make a plan, follow plan (sonke found frustrating)
                - born out of a need for something to give students 
                - interest in luhmanns theoretical work
                - represent something so complex but at the same time very clear like systems theory
            - being familiar w/ theories on how tech shapes our work
            - was surprised how little attention [[Zettelkasten]] got in the academic community
            - modern books have 1 idea & blow it up & try to explain almost everything with this 1 idea (vs making connections w/ various ideas in a way that makes sense)
            - spinoff of theoretical interest + something he was interested in himself; sonke personally used
            - ### **if you put the idea out, someone else who is better equipped to create a software that works**
            - Roam is developed independently, but it immediately resonated & sonke likes how ideas seem to pop up in different places (he has really high hopes for this technology being a leverage for changing high education)
            - making connections between ideas that are new & old (some already forgotten- if we don't take notes we're floating on the new ideas); the brain is bad at holding new information
                - interested in moment you have to make decision between 2 notes ("i thought this was the same idea but it isn't") - when you write new note making explicit connection
                - problems like [[confirmation bias]], making things fit, being more humble about our lack of understanding (the moment we write things down we realize it wasn't that well understood)
                    - progressive summarization?!?
                - taking notes is one of the filtering processes bc it takes more time to take notes vs reading more
            - is it relevant outside of academic community?
            - roam has advantage of removing fiction
            - Sonke is ignorant about new features & all the things you can do
            - warning to look for perfect system- while it seems attractive w/ daily routine but it becomes automatic (Depends on where he stands w/ different projects)
            - wants to 
    - Week 1 Update
        - ^^**Goal** — read the book at a fleeting note stage.^^

Once we have a base familiarity with the book, we will then move deeper towards zettels in the weeks ahead.
        - **Meetups** — Please feel free to meet up and organize your own sessions with other Book Club members. 

Page for [meetups]([[Meetup]]).

        - **Interview: Luca Dellanna**
            - Author [Luca Dellanna](https://cwhitesullivan.acemlna.com/lt.php?s=c5dd98666fad46da071ebb031e85e5f4&i=150A977A20A750) recently published his book Ergodicity as a Roam graph! Luca is going to join us today to reflect on the experience, and give us some advice about what is possible when exploring a book in Roam at the block level like we are with Sönke's book. A discussion with someone else at the frontier!

        - ^^This week, we move from the **Fleeting notes** phase to the **Literature notes** phase.^^
        - **Live session summary**
            - We discussed the fleeting notes concept, supplemented with some great written ideas on fleeting notes in the graph as well (check out linked references on this page: [[Fleeting Notes]]!). To add to this, here's Sonke's thoughts on [fleeting notes from the book](https://roamresearch.com/#/app/roam-book-club-2/page/wmFEVrD5o).
            - We were also joined by Luca Dellanna, the first author to publish a book in Roam.

        - **Next steps**
            - Sönke's book is a call to action. It's asking us, very deliberately, to pursue note-taking as a technique with specific steps beyond reading by highlighting, conducting general discussion, or reviewing by memory. Sönke suggests note-taking is a technique requiring deliberate practice, akin to playing piano or lifting weights.
                - "Taking literature notes is a form of deliberate practice as it gives us feedback on our understanding or lack of it, while the effort to put into our own words the gist of something is at the same time the best approach to understanding what we read."
        - **Note-taking virtuosity**
            - ^^As we move out of the fleeting note phase, and into Sönke's terminology of literature note phase, this week, we want to reflect on our own note-taking skill and to consider some fundamental questions posed by the book about how you take notes and read more generally:^^
                - __How much time have you spent reading Sönke's book so far?__
                - __Have you reviewed your highlights?__
                - __Have you revisited the book and started to write notes on it in your own words?__
                - __How can you refine your notes so that they become more than the sum of their parts?__
        - **Literature notes**
            - The goal this week (and next) is to ^^read the book again, but this time write literature notes.^^ This means to write in your own words, and look to summarise key arguments in each chapter, but it's described in the book as fundamental competency of note-taking. Richard Feynman agrees too.
                - "The ability to express understanding in one’s own words is a fundamental competency for everyone who writes–and only by doing it with the chance of realizing our lack of understanding can we become better at it. But the better we become, the easier and quicker we can make notes, which again increases the number of learning experiences. The same applies to the crucial ability to distinguish the important bits of a text from the less important ones: the better we become at it, the more effective our reading will become, the more we can read, the more we will learn. We will enter a beautiful, virtuous circle of competency. You cannot help but feel motivated by it."
            - Re-read or search the book too if you need any more guidance on what literature notes are.
            - The aim is to get as far through literature notes as possible this week, but we also have next week's extension week to help complete this phase as well, so you have a bit more time if you need.  After this phase, we will then move on to permanent notes/zettels phase in the final few weeks.
        - **Block referencing**
            - We have Sönke's full book in the the Book Club graph, and when completing your literature notes this week, we would like you to ^^try and block reference from the full text. This will allow us to create commentary on individual blocks, seeing summaries for different Book Club members on each block.^^

[Recording of this process](https://cwhitesullivan.acemlna.com/lt.php?s=c5dd98666fad46da071ebb031e85e5f4&i=151A982A20A765).
- Week 3: [[November 15th, 2020]]
    - [[Book Club Live Session 3]]
        - Pre-Session Email
            - This week, we're going to focus on literature notes! Starting with a 15-minute writing session, we'll try to reflect on the concept of literature notes, the process you've taken to implement them, any struggles you've had, and enlightening moments you've had while doing them.

Then we'll break out into smaller groups to discuss what we've written and how we can take better literature notes. Then we'll reconvene and I will demonstrate how I use ((block references)) to make my literature notes and we'll do a short exercise to get everyone up to speed on how to make use of block references with the slip-box method in Roam.

Then we will break out again into smaller groups and do a 10-minute literature note writing exercise followed by a 10-minute exercise where everyone will teach the rest of their group what they learned from the writing exercise. And here's today's [agenda in Roam](https://cwhitesullivan.acemlna.com/lt.php?s=c5dd98666fad46da071ebb031e85e5f4&i=154A990A20A779).
    - Week 3 Update
        - Working through literature notes this week & starting to progress to permanent notes / zettels.
        - **Last week's live session summary**
            - Thanks to Bardia for hosting the live session last week. Included some writing practice, demonstrated block referencing from the full book in graph, and another graph meditation.
            - Still a few questions about how to take literature notes, and how to block reference from the book coming in this week, so I thought I would record a few of my literature note sessions this week. You can watch one [here](https://cwhitesullivan.lt.acemlna.com/Prod/link-tracker?redirectUrl=aHR0cHMlM0ElMkYlMkZyb2FtcmVzZWFyY2guY29tJTJGJTIzJTJGYXBwJTJGcm9hbS1ib29rLWNsdWItMiUyRnBhZ2UlMkZ1dkxpMldHa2U=&a=66602312&account=cwhitesullivan%2Eactivehosted%2Ecom&email=JRd9FVg9B0WziDtA9A5iF%2FlMy%2BOWWuyaZunZiCXh6gI%3D&s=c5dd98666fad46da071ebb031e85e5f4&i=156A993A20A800).
        - **Live session this week**
            - There will be writing time, breakout rooms, graph reflection and a few demonstrations-

Mike Kramer to talk through his Literature note/Zettel process & Dharam Kapila to demonstrate Roam Portal on the graph.
- Week 4: [[November 22nd, 2020]]
    - [[Book Club Live Session 4]]
        - pre-session email
            - This week we reflect on the book and progress so far, as we move clear of literature notes and in to Permanent Notes/Zettels phase.
            - In today's session, we will have writing practice, breakout rooms, a group discussion on Zettels, and culminate with some suggestions on how to structure Zettels in the Book Club Graph in the week ahead.
            - A few guest speakers too-
        - [[Writing practice]] #Prompts
            - **Pick from the prompts below and write in your own page for 15 minutes.**
                - Reflect on the book. What are you impressions?
                - Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way?
                - Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far?
                - How is your progress towards your initial goals? Or have they changed?
                - Explore the concept of permanent notes/zettels.
                - Do you have any questions for [[Sönke Ahrens]]?
        - [[Breakout Rooms]] #Notes
            - I was joined by [[Beverly Hall]], [[Jim Stanczak]], [[Alex Shchedrin]] & [[Mike Kramer]]
            - Beverly also uses DevonThink (as a collection point / repository) and Tinderbox (to lay out notes visually)
                - Fun to type words into DevonThink & see what the algorithm pulls up- it doesn't require quite as much input on the user end as Roam does
            - Jim has written 2 papers using Roam so far- moving blocks around & putting the outline together! Rad. He uses: https://roam-tools.ryanguill.com/
            - Alex is thinking about other books clubs (work, etc.) - ripple effect of the positive experience thus far w/ both Roam Book Clubs :)
            - Mike mentioned the uncomfortable process of learning [[Zettelkasten]]- when something's uncomfortable it's good b/c it means you're growing- agree.
                - Importance of an editor (good editors cut)
        - [[Graph Meditation]]
        - [[Roam Portal]] demo by [[Dharam Kapila]]
- Week 5: [[November 29th, 2020]]
    - [[Live Session 5]]
        - {{[[TODO]]}} [[Writing practice]]
            - Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month. 
            - Reflect on your Zettel process
            - Why do you want a Zettelkasten?
            - {{[[TODO]]}} **__Pick from the prompts below and write in your own page for 15 minutes.__**[*](((3myi3WQfd)))
                1. Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month.[*](((XSNQcvese)))
                2. Reflect on your Zettel process[*](((PHU7lXKIB)))
                3. Why do you want a Zettlekasten?
        - Guided zettel writing exercise by [[Beau Haan 📌]] showing his bottom-up process - see [[Guided Writing Exercise]]
            - fresh namespaced page: [[Lindsey Johnston✨/Zettels]]
            - **Reading for exercise**[*](((4hIM0I_l_))) - ^^Ch. 14 - Make it a Habit^^
                - The trick is not to try to break with **old habits** and also not to use willpower to force oneself to do something else, but to **strategically build up new habits that have a chance to replace the old ones.** ^^The goal here^^ is to **__get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects.__** If we manage to ^^establish a routine in **this first step**^^, it becomes much easier to develop the urge to turn these findings into permanent notes and connect them with other notes in the slip-box. It is not so difficult to get used to **thinking within an external memory of notes**, as the advantages become obvious quite quickly. As soon as we have ^^**__developed a new routine,__** __we can do what intuitively feels right, which requires no effort.__^^ Watching others reading books and doing nothing other than underlining some sentences or making unsystematic notes that will end up nowhere will soon be a painful sight.
            - ### Guided questions from Beau as you go along ↓
                - **Question 1** guided questions:
                    - What resonates with you?
What else does this remind you of?
What are the associations that come to mind?
Can you pull out an abstraction from that?
                    - Certain words may pop out:
→ What does **willpower** mean to you?
→ What does **strategy** mean to you?
→ How about **routine**?
^^__What resonates with you as you read certain words?__
^^→ How about **advantages**?
                    - **What are times that you developed a new routine and stuck with it?** What did it feel like to intuitively know what to do next, where it didn't require effort? What are some associations happening as you think about those? 
                    - Can you pull out an abstraction from that? What else does this remind you of?
                - **Next,** write a little summary on the master Q1 bullet next to "Question 1" - a thumbnail of the higher-resolution image underneath
                    - the purpose is to abstract out the associations that are coming to mind as you're reading the block of text - this is the work. it's not easy, but it's simple.
                    - Voila- you have a beautiful summary from the big wall of text beneath, which you can open & close w/ the bullet
                - **Question 2** guided instructions/questions: (directly regarding the source material)
                    - Being informed by what you abstracted/summarized w/ Q1 - what is the author saying now? How can you write that in your own words (w/out summarizing) to prove to yourself that you understood what the author is actually saying? 
                    - This is the difficult part because you're abstracting what the author is saying, being informed by what you wrote below using this **bottom-up structure**. 
                    - How can you reiterate/synthesize what the author has said **__in your own words__**? → ^^**How can you prove that you understand what the author is saying?** ^^
                    - Using the tools that Roam offers, at this block level so you can go back and see what you've abstracted under Q1 + in the sidebar you have the source material as well
                - On the **Question 3** block ↓
                    - __Taking everything that you've already abstracted and taken apart and wrestled with, with the idea of this bottom-up structure...__ Being informed by Q1 (the fleeting notes), being informed by Q2, and also have the availability to the evidence/source material in the sidebar- **What is a clear statement that you can say about what you've synthesized? How can you word this statement in a way that gives you the most clarity in what you mean?**
                        - the root word declarative → Latin __declarare__ (de-__clarare__) which is where we get the word clarity from
                        - Being informed by Q1, Q2, having the source material in the sidebar, what is a clear statement that you can say about what you've synthesized, in your own words. (keep this to 1-2 sentences)
                    - Q3 might take a little bit of editing (Beau went through 2-3 iterations before he was CLEAR on what he was saying)
                    - Keep in mind we want to have a conversation with this Q3 statement, after we've synthesized from the evidence, from the source, and the multiple levels of abstraction from Q1 → this is the work (again it's not easy but it IS simple)
                    - Once you're happy with the clarity that you've synthesized → highlight the text & double-open-bracket, hit enter, make it into a page.
                    -  what you've got, highlight text & double-open-bracket to turn it into a page Lindsey's example for summary
            - **Analogy to use:** __quickly__ going from [[gas → liquid → solid]]
                - If [[Zettelkasten]] was a pot where you're throwing in your vegetables etc in, as the lid was open, other people have thrown other ideas in there - one idea, in particular, is the verbiage used in the digital gardening community (seedling, budding, evergreen)
                    - the terms substantiate meaning that's not beneficial for zettelkasten- the idea of time- seedlings take time to grow, budding notes take time to grow, evergreen notes take time to grow
                    - the whole point of zettelkasten is to slam all 3 of these together as quickly as possible so our conversation happens at the zettel-level
                    - New analogy: 3 phases of all matter → you want to __quickly__ get from [[gas → liquid → solid]] (fleeting → literature → permanent notes)
                        - fast moving gas particles
                        - if you can start capturing those fast-moving fleeting notes to slow down the molecules, it starts becoming a liquid, and it will start dropping
                        - but liquid without a container is useless. so if we have a container called evidence (or the container is the source material/bibliography), you can capture these fast-moving particles and slow down these thoughts into a liquid (contained in a container called the reference notes)
                        - then if you're able to take this liquid, slow-down/crystallize these thoughts even more into a solid-state permanent note 
                        - you want to __quickly__ get from [[gas → liquid → solid]] 
fleeting → literature → permanent notes
                        - so you can start having the discussion that everyone desires, or this conversation partner at the permanent note level
                    - question:: (from Henry) this process is very linear (fleeting notes become literature notes, or are sister to literature notes, and then they teepee together into zettels), what if you have fleeting notes that are never related to zettels, that are cool to just leave as fleeting notes, and same with literature notes that may never bubble up to zettels
                        - can we then have a zettel that doesn't have fleeting notes or literature notes? just an idea that bubbled up that has no substantiated support yet?
                        - [[Beau Haan 📌]]: yes, [[Sönke Ahrens]] talks about it in the book - the purpose of the slip-box is to have one place where the discussion actually happens; you want the dialogue that happens there is with a formed dialogue partner (evidence-based, with multiple levels of abstraction)
                            - "project notes" - keep a firewall between that and your actual dialogue partner
                        - [[Matt McKinlay]]: avoid vague fortune cookie idea so it's effective, evidence-based so you have lineage to a source

            - The bottom-up approach I enjoy but will definitely take some more practice - [[Beau Haan 📌]]'s live session helped tremendously in wrapping my head around structuring this bottom-up approach in [[Roam]]
        - "What's your favourite blocks (or quotes) from the book?"
