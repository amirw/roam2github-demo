        - Good note-taking is to writing as meditation is to breathing. It’s automatic so we don’t tend to pay attention to it [*](((NOUeE9wbB)))
        - We don’t experience immediate negative feedback with poor notes which means there’s not much demand for help [*](((1NqxVWlvh)))

        - a good workflow and structure enables flow
        - Simple but overarching system, like GTD but open ended for writing, learning and thinking
        - The slip box
            - Invented by Niklas Luhmann
            - It’s about having the right tools and knowing how to use them - you need both
            - It is part of a workflow
            - Two boxes

                    - Brief notes on the content
        - "Now that you know how the slip-box works, you only need to understand how to work with it. And the best way to understand this is to understand a little bit about the way we think, learn and develop ideas. And if I were forced to boil it down to a single bullet point, it would be this: We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains. But first, let me guide you through the process of writing a paper with the slip-box."
            - “**We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains**”
                - key point
    - "[[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]"
        - "Thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research or writes. If you write to improve all of these activities, you have a strong tailwind going for you. If you take your notes in a smart way, it will propel you forward."
            - How do you write to improve these activities - is there a piece I'm missing?
                - Q: Is there a systematic way to improve?
                - Q: Can you break this into subskills to improve upon in an incremental fashion while making progress on your work?
        - "1. Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. Don’t worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on. These are fleeting notes, mere reminders of what is in your head. They should not cause any distraction. Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later. I usually have a simple notebook with me, but I am happy with napkins or receipts if nothing else is at hand. Sometimes I leave a voice record on my phone. If your thoughts are already sorted and you have the time, you can skip this step and write your idea directly down as a proper, permanent note for your slip-box."
            - I've found in practice that fleeting notes made in the moment are often forgotten or are less clear by the time I revisit, even the same day.
            - Capture every idea that pops into your mind
            - Process later
        - "2. Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don’t want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing. Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words. Be extra selective with quotes–don’t copy them to skip the step of really understanding what they mean. Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place–your reference system."
            - Keep it short
            - Be selective
            - Write what you don’t want to forget or think you might use in your own writing
                - I can use my [[12 favourite problems]] to help decide if this is likely worth doing
            - Use your own words
        - "3. Make permanent notes. Now turn to your slip-box. Go through the notes you made in step one or two (ideally once a day and before you forget what you meant) and think about how they relate to what is relevant for your own research, thinking or interests. This can soon be done by looking into the slip-box–it only contains what interests you anyway. The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions. Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have (in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?"

            - Another key point: Try working on different manuscripts at the same time. While the slip-box is already helpful to get one project done, its real strength comes into play when we start working on multiple projects at the same time. The slip-box is in some way what the chemical industry calls “verbund.” This is a setup in which the inevitable by-product of one production line becomes the resource for another, which again produces by-products that can be used in other processes and so on, until a network of production lines becomes so efficiently intertwined that there is no chance of an isolated factory competing with it anymore. [*](((TNNxdmyUe)))
                - This idea of verbund is really interesting to me and it's how I see Roam helping to connect these processes together more easily and visually
            - It is like martial arts: If you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it, but redirect it towards another productive goal. The slip-box will always provide you with multiple possibilities. [*](((2WQrQNiI-)))
                - This seems to be the antidote to [[Steven Pressfield]]'s Resistance.
            - 
    - "[[Afterword]]"
    - "And likewise, the sum of the slip-box content is worth much more than the sum of the notes. More notes mean more possible connections, more ideas, more synergy between different projects and therefore a much higher degree of productivity. Luhmann’s slip-box contains about 90,000 notes, which sounds like an incredibly large number. But it only means that he wrote six notes a day from the day he started to work with his slip-box until he died."
        - When you break it down like this it feels more achievable for mere mortals. If you consume just a few articles and a book chapter per day, the likelihood is you'll get at least a few permanent notes from it. If not, you're reading the wrong material
    - "There is no secret to it and the explanation is pretty simple: Handwriting is slower and can’t be corrected as quickly as electronic notes. Because students can’t write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. But to be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in the first place. So if you are writing by hand, you are forced to think about what you hear (or read)–otherwise you wouldn’t be able to grasp the underlying principle, the idea, the structure of an argument. Handwriting makes pure copying impossible, but instead facilitates the translation of what is said (or written) into one’s own words. The students who typed into their laptops were much quicker, which enabled them to copy the lecture more closely but circumvented actual understanding. They focused on completeness. Verbatim notes can be taken with almost no thinking, as if the words are taking a short cut from the ear to the hand, bypassing the brain."
        - There's lots of evidence that handwriting enables better retention than typing - activates a different mode somehow
            - Now we rail against it because we have digital notes since they're preferable for search and the "being productive/efficient" mindset
            - modern digital solutions provide the best of both with the likes of Apple Pencil and iPad and similar solutions
    - "Also, we shouldn’t underestimate the advantages of writing. In oral presentations, we easily get away with unfounded claims. We can distract from argumentative gaps with confident gestures or drop a casual “you know what I mean” irrespective of whether we know what we meant. In writing, these manoeuvres are a little too obvious. It is easy to check a statement like: “But that is what I said!” The most important advantage of writing is that it helps us to confront ourselves when we do not understand something as well as we would like to believe."
        - writing forces you to understand better

    - "Reflection on first reading phase of the book "
        - The general concept of the [[Zettelkasten]] makes sense and I like that there's a structure that I can fit my note-taking into
            - But, I'm not an academic, I'm not used to thinking as one, maybe this shows my thinking is not as clear as I want it to be
            - I struggle to see how to do this well. I feel like I should be milking every drop. I often read to understand the concept and how to apply it in a practical sense and I highlight liberally as I try to get to grips with the concepts. How this translates into the steps of the [[Zettelkasten]] is where I feel like I fall down
        - Making new connections and following what's interesting to you makes the process more enjoyable.
        - The idea of good questions to help inform the process
        - "What ideas resonate with you from the book"
            - "What is the gist of the book? "
                - Using the [[Zettelkasten]] system that [[Sönke Ahrens]] describes for taking notes means that your writing output should never need to start from a blank slate.
                    - It's the inverse of what we're "taught" about how to take notes and write (often we're never really taught this, or how to even take good notes - I wasn't). [I suspect there's a lot of years of bad note-taking that needs to be undone]

        - Helping each other learn how to ask better questions is really useful
    - I like to break blocks apart in my own graph, or progressively summarise them - figuring out how this could be done in a shared graph would be good
        - cool [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] suggested how to do this with text and alias and then use the create blocks double parenthesis trick to pull things out
    - There's almost too much information to getting started so the 80/20 of what is essential to know to get started would be good.
        - I missed week one with a dodgy internet so I feel a bit blind. A recap or summary of the live session would be helpful to get oriented
    - Referencing other peoples fleeting notes feels "dangerous" - they may disappear
    - Is there a way we can agree to tag questions or open questions?
        - It would be good to be able to ask open questions at the block level and see others answers to those

            - #Chat [[Andy Henson]] [[~[[Brandon Toner]]]] [[@[[Matt McKinlay]]]] how about using namespacing to disambiguate? e.g. [[meta/literature note]] then you can hide the meta if you don't like the aesthetics?

- I might be starting a controversy here with this, but I'm not sure I really believe in the concept of `permanent note`, at all. [*](((dhj2_KbGh)))
    - #Chat [[Andy Henson]] [[~[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]]There is a school of thought in the [[Zettelkasten]] community that permanent notes aren't permanent; they're malleable. I tend to agree and I think I prefer the term [[Evergreen Notes]] for them instead. It has a greater implied meaning that they aren't so fixed and static. They have the opportunity to be changed as new information becomes available.
        - I like that!

    - "Define a literature note in your own words."
        - A literature note is my reframing of an idea or a concept from another source and has a 1-1 relationship with that source; i.e. it directly relates.
            - It usually starts from a highlighting or sentence or phrase that resonates with me for some reason
            - Sometimes it forms the genesis of a permanent note, other times it adds weight or evidence to an existing note, or it may refute or add counter-claims to a note
    - "How do you take literature notes? Discuss your method."
        - Most of my source material starts from highlighting passages in either Instapaper, via Kindle, or OCR of a physical book (via Readwise). I'll add a brief note/comment as a form of fleeting note and then they are all pushed to Readwise.
        - I have a daily review practice where Readwise will resurface these highlights. I reflect on, progressively summarise the highlight itself and then add and refine my notes. When all the highlights for the book or article is complete they're sent to Roam for the next steps into permanent notes (or as I'm calling them evergreen notes). I prefer that term [*](((CuHFh1r57)))
        - 
    - "Have you found value in taking literature notes already?"
        - Yes, the key for me is in the active processing. It's not enough to just read; have ideas and jot a quick note. The value is in the repeated exposure to it, and the more active wrestling - or [[kenjitsu]] as James Somers calls it - to more fully assimilate and deepen your understanding of the ideas being conveyed. We often just have the illusion of knowledge; when we actively question ourselves it reveals the shortcomings in our understanding.
    - "Describe any enlightening moments you had while taking literature notes."
        - The transformation I've experienced is a reduction in highlighting "randomly"

        - "Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way? "
            - With a second read, I finally "get" Literature Notes, and now that I do I find that taking notes takes on a new meaning and significance. Reframing everything in your own words forces a more active learning and understanding of the material which makes the jump to permanent note easier.
        - "Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? "
            - When I have tried before, I've failed miserably, or rather I realised I'd been doing it "wrong". What has clicked for me is a streamlined process that shortens the time from fleeting through to permanent. It takes time, but it's worth the effort.

Typically it will be written in a declarative style as a single atomic thought which can be combined and reused. It connects and builds upon other notes to form a verbundance of output.
            - "What is holding you back from creating zettels?"

        - "Reflect on your Zettel process"
            - Having worked with [[Beau Haan]] the last few months and through a second reading of this book, I have totally rebuilt and transformed my process - from what I thought were some kind of vaguely permanent notes, I'm now starting to have a conversation with my [[Zettelkasten]].
        - 
            - I see this as a lifelong, long term endeavour to enable me to think better, and more clearly, where I can learn to accumulate, articulate and share my ideas. Through a more active dialogue I hope to generate more insights through the connections I make, and also solidify my beliefs and values, internalising them and turning them into action.
- 
- Live Session 7
    - "You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say? "
        - My zettelkasten is my conversation partner. It is the external representation of my thoughts which allows me to argue and articulate my thinking further. It is a simple structure that through its constraints forces me to make decisions and choices about what is worthy of pursuit.
    - "Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?"
        - I've slowed down to go faster. I am reading less, but more deeply, and extracting and wringing more from the ideas that truly resonate. It is helping me learn and progress in building the knowledge and wisdom for me to grow both personally and professionally.
    - "The book promotes a bottom up approach to note taking, which we have used in Book Club. Reflect on this. How did this feel? "
        - I had started on this path previously, but through the book club and this second reading, I have begun to more fully internalise and habitualise it. Using Beau's method to smash the parts together means I have created more permanent notes in the last 6 weeks than the previous 6 years. It is forcing me to commit to the idea that resonates, and stop waiting for the perfect time and for some nebulous future time when there'll be enough critical mass that means I can (finally) create the perfect permanent note. By really atomising each thought - which Roam encourages naturally through its blocks - I can see that I am easily able to mix and remix these atomic thoughts into multiple compound ideas and create new works with ease. They are backed by evidence of the source material. It's also now giving me more confidence as I can start to see glimmers of clearer thinking.
    - "What's your favourite blocks (or quotes) from the book?"
        - > “Well, writing other books. I always work on different manuscripts at the same time. With this method, to work on different things simultaneously, I never encounter any mental blockages.”(Luhmann, Baecker, and Stanitzek 1987, 125–55) **It is like martial arts: If you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it, but redirect it towards another productive goal.** [*](((288L6kXfd)))

It will get to a point where no-one else can get close to your output."
            - I really love this idea of verbund and how it applies to the zettelkasten
    - "Comment on your impressions of the shared graph"
        - Chaotic, in a good way. It causes an amount of serendipitous discovery through the chaos, but without a shared, common purpose and conventions it's also difficult to navigate.
        - I really like seeing the connections, insights and experiences that others apply to the source material.
        - I haven't spent as much time in the graph as I'd have liked but seeing how others have structured their corner of the graph gives me plenty of food for thought to use Roam better.
    - "Reflect on Roam Book Club"
        - It's been a real experience! Firstly, it was an excellent text to learn from, and with others. The calibre of the individuals who comprise the group is amazing. Talking and discussing with a very diverse and group has been a privilege. Seeing the thought and effort, and clarity of thinking of others is inspiring.

    - Writing practice
        - "What have you learnt about note taking that I (Sönke) should know about?"
            - The bottom-up approach to note-taking was a revelation to me, and turns the idea of note-taking on its head. I think that the method in Roam which [[Beau Haan]] has proposed streamlines the process to remove as much friction as possible, which for people whose primary role is not research and has limited time each day, really opens the process up to them. Additionally, so far, it really makes it far easier to have a living conversation with your zettelkasten, which is not something I've ever experienced before.
        - "Are there any additions to the process described in the book?"
            - I would have liked to see more concrete examples of your own system and your note styles. One of the impediments to starting is knowing if you're doing it "right" so it's helpful to see what others do. Online there are a wide variety of examples but they differ greatly, and I think they miss important concepts that you cover in the book. Throughout the book club, there's been a wide range of opinions and thoughts on what each type of note might actually look like, and how they interact to form the actual zettelkasten itself. 
        - "Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten?"
            - Within the digital realm I think there are opportunities and potential issues with the zettelkasten method. I think there might be hidden advantages to the analogue paper and pen system that which the natural constraints enforce. Digital doesn't tend to have this, which may change the benefits in some way--it's hard to know at this stage.
        - "Reflect on your impressions of the book "
            - I have really enjoyed the second reading of it. I got even more out of it this time around. I realised that there are many misconceptions about what zettelkasten actually is because there's been so much written by others in the productivity space but with mixed concepts so there's lots of confusion.
        - "Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?"
            - I had already started to become more discerning with the highlights I made, and I see that discernment as even more important. I have rebuilt
        - "Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?  "
            - Yes, through this book and the book club, with Beau's template method I plan to continue to use it. I see a lot of potential in the daily practice as a habit and system to really improve the clarity of my thinking and my actions. From this I am already seeing new connections, which is sparking other ideas which I can continue to build on. I really see it as a superior solution to the common ailment of "writers block".
