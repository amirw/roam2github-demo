        - Writing is both the means (note-taking) AND the end (final output e.g. manuscript, book etc)
        - [the slip-box inverts the top down approach where writing is considered separate from other tasks like thinking or reading & given much more importance as the final keystone or "main event” when in fact writing should be present at all stages, even before we come up with a good question](((U0_AKhDHt)))
        - [Constantly writing also improves your other intellectual skills for the better as a by-effect](((9LdD6VzxA)))  
            - increased efficiency when listening to information
                - how would i be more efficient? because i'm listening with a goal in mind, i'm taking lit notes as i'm listening?
            - ability to identify good arguments
            - more focus and engagement when reading which means you will elaborate on the meaning, understanding leads to remembering -> turning knowledge into something else
            - maybe would need to flesh out how for each of these
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]] 
    - To think further about the Zettel process in Roam 
        - a little time consuming to copy and paste all other books the way it's been done for Sonke Ahrens directly into Roam - faster way? Text format available to just dump into Roam?
        - how to indicate a comment directly on a single sentence within a block? it feels a bit limiting to just ref huge blocks rn

            - History shows that there is great, underestimated power in simplicity. One change in routine/organisation has transformative/revolutionary potential.
                - Henry Ford (car to the worker instead of workers to the car)
                - NASA vs Russia on writing in space - NASA overcomplicated the solution i.e. a pressurised pen - the solution seemed to expand to fit their budget
                - [McLean & the shipping container](((cfebc0ULz))) - actually still don't get what happened here lol
            - In the case of the slip-box, quality individual notes mingling with & relating to each other over time builds **critical mass**

    - [[Joey Harris]]
- #Zettels [[a daunting and monumental task can become manageable if we routinely chip at it]]
    - #[[Literature Notes]] [[Chapter 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch]]
        - the slip-box can become a deep well from which we can draw ideas if we routinely contribute to it every day 
        - success is due less to genius than to a system of small habits which, executed every day, leads to compounded returns
            - this is repeated again next chapter
            - "It is not so important who you are , but what you do." (p4)
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
        - We can underestimate the power of the banal & the routine in our everyday to build up to great work.
        - ~~Great things are built from tiny; great comes from ~~~~small;  ~~~~great things come from small~~
        - Even the greatest of creations starts from the single, humble building block
        - A monument started with a brick, a story with a letter, a powerful speech from a word. (more than the sum of parts type thing). Similarly, if notes are the building blocks of writing, shouldn’t we make sure the way we design and organise them is strong to be assured the entire resulting structure (article, thesis, dissertation) is sound? ... "A chain is only as strong as its weakest link"
            - "Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note. "

    - [[Work becomes play as concentrated expertise is freely expressed.]] - really like this
    - #[[Literature Notes]] [[Chapter 8. Let the Work Carry You Forward]]
        - Successful people do not rely on willpower to practice rather rely on a holistic system and process, and have a growth mindset
            - wise use of **powerful tools linked/embedded in a seamless, holistic, overarching, interlocked workflow/process** - to become daily routines, working habits, structure RATHER THAN an exertion of will to overcome resistance or use of those same, powerful tools in isolation (p9) (app://obsidian.md/productivity)
                - interlocked workflow **=** routine OR workflow **enables** routine??
                - are they **automatic** because they are embedded in an overarching workflow? isn't the very definition of habits are automatic tasks
            - growth mindset, i.e. getting progressively better at something is inherently rewarding. the most reliable long - term **growth strategy** is seeking as many opportunities to learn as possible (p53)
            - a **learning system** which embeds** **[feedback loops](app://obsidian.md/feedback%20loops) (in this case it’s note-taking i.e. paraphrasing, translating, elaborating to test our understanding of a text) (p53)
                - the very process of attempting and failing encourages the building of long-term memory (section 10.5, p88)
                - what’s the difference between this the interlocked process mentioned first point?
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
        - Other summaries: 
            - the slip-box creates the internal **momentum** towards long-term learning and success i.e. the work itself (putting notes into the slip-box) is the source of our motivation and not dependent on short-term external rewards to complete
            - the slip box promotes a self-sustaining/self-regulating cycle of motivation by creating a "virtuous circle" of learning. this is critical to long-term learning & personal success …
            - the slip-box taps into the dynamics of motivation i.e **the work itself **(putting notes into the slip-box) - **is the source of our motivation** and not dependent on short-term external rewards to complete.
            - so writing using the slip-box helps creates its own momentum
        - the slip box contains **inner connectedness** (lines of developed thought) & **complexity** thoughts can relate to each other in unexpected ways - helping you become worldly-wise
            - i like this description but i feel like it doesn’t belong here - where does it belong instead?
- #[[Zettels]] [[slowly ease into replacing bad habits with good ones by taking the first smallest actionable step ]]
    - #[[Literature Notes]] 
        - the very familiarity of a habit skews our perception of future self-control 
            - "familiarity breeds contempt"
            - other attempts to summarise this point
                - ~~we underestimate how much the familiarity of a habit influences our control over our intentions~~
                - because of its familiarity, we underestimate how much a force of habit actually influences our own control over our intentions
                - because of familiarity, we underestimate how much a habit influences our future self-control
                - the very familiarity of a habit colours (feel like this isn't enough of a negative word) our perception of self-control over future actions
                - similar to the [mere exposure effect](app://obsidian.md/mere%20exposure%20effect), we have less control than we think over our habits, including the bad ones,
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
        -  start slow - first just make the effort to record the most important or personally interesting parts of source material while reading - then soon enough you'll progress to making literature notes
        - other summaries of the chapter
            - consciously make the effort & time to establish note-writing as a good habit
            - consciously & consistently practice note-writing - i.e. keep taking notes
        - **habits** (operations we repeatedly perform without thinking) —largely influences —> **intention** (what we do in the immediate future)
            - **familiarity** of an action affects our judgement/perception/“intuitive expectations” of our control over that action **mere exposure effect** i.e. we have less control than we think over an action we repeatedly perform
            - is intention like the ego he talked about? 
        - don’t muscle out the bad habits, slowly replace them with new habits, take the time to establish good routines. 
            - in terms of the slip-box, this is writing ideas with pen and paper, translating them into permanent notes to enforce that **virtuous circle of learning**
            - acknowledgement and awareness of the dark sides of our natural tendencies is the first step to overcoming them

            - **What resonates with you?** What's triggered when you hear words like strategy, routine, advantages - free flow stream of consciousness is what i think [[Beau Haan]]'s saying 
            - "Watching others reading books and doing nothing other than underlining some sentences or making unsystematic notes that will end up nowhere will soon be a painful sight."
                - reminds me of all my days in high school trying to find strategies to rote learn and take notes, but getting overwhelmed and disenchanted and bored with the material
                - sonke's advice to at first pay attention to what interests you as a gateway to writing permanent notes ensures constant engagement and learning
