- **Process Notes:**
    - Mark down __anything__ that sparks a thought - don't be stingy! 
- Fleeting Notes:: 
    - __Based on the concept of a Zettlekasten (or, slip-box) as used by prolific social scientist Nikolas Luhman__
    - Writing is the medium of learning, not the final step
        - Writing seems hard because it's taught as a linear process starting with "come up with a topic"
        - Topics should arise naturally from clusters or patterns of ideas in daily note-taking
    - It is difficult and perhaps futile to comprehensively apply productivity concepts like David Allen's GTD to areas like academic research, where the outcome is, necessarily, unknown, and the greatest insights are often from tangents. 
    - The collection, translation, and contextualization of information is the most important part of the writing process, but is rarely taught
        - The steps linking a final draft to a rough draft to an outline to organized notes to fleeting notes are relatively straightforward, but the process is often collapsed into itself
    - Ideas are only as useful as they are independently understandable; you must translate quotes, concepts and thoughts into full sentences that will be understandable independent of the context from which they were originally derived. 
        - Each concept should be simplified as much as possible; too much information risks distracting from the important information. 
    - There are four main categories of notes: fleeting notes; project notes; reference notes; permanent notes. 
        - Fleeting notes are quickly captured as they occur, to be processed into subsequent note-types later and disposed of. 
        - Project notes are relevant to specific projects, and can be disposed of when the project is completed
        - Reference notes include specific information about source material, direct quotes, and pages. 
        - Permanent notes are the heart of any idea-generating system; they are those notes that have been collected, translated and contextualized to be put into a slip-box type system. 
    - An effective workflow is one that is as simple, adaptable, and enjoyable as is possible. 
        - The key components are a means by which all ideas are captured; a reference system into which all sources of ideas are kept; and a filing system by which ideas are kept in useful contexts. 
            - i.e. David Allen's GTD "collection" step; a reference system like Zotero; and a slip-box, or other method by which fully processed ideas are housed. 
                - The slip-box is a place to collect carefully curated, single ideas so they might eventually hang together in a web of knowledge
    - It is important to engage with whatever material you are attempting to learn from; be wary of anything that gives you a false sense of engagement, especially if it is "more efficient", like automatic highlighting.

            - "#Reply[[Latham Turner]]: I found as I was reading the book and doing the same, that highlighting was a way to feel like I was accomplishing anything without really engaging with the material.  I stopped highlighting and started forcing myself to stop and capture my thoughts even in a fleeting note. I even embedded the quoted part i would have just highlighted, but I already notice I'm recalling the points better than when I was just highlighting.  That insight in itself was worth the price of the book"

        - Writing is the medium by which we learn, not the final product demonstrating having learned.
        - Taking notes in a systematic, efficient, and enjoyable way will contribute to idea-generation, draft-building, and paper-writing that does not rely on the limited resource of willpower.
            - Yet, we are almost never taught how to take "good" notes or how to structure a workflow for taking notes, and there is no immediate negative feedback for having taken useless notes
            - This is perhaps one of the reasons writing is perceived as such a difficult task - we are taught about writing only from the stage of the blank page, rather tha 
            - This reminds me of arguments presented in "Half-assing it with everything you've got". Namely, that the goal should be to hit some personally-defined quality target with a minimum of effort. I have long put A LOT of energy into taking notes, and it's never been clear whether those notes are actually useful enough to justify their energy input. What is the goal of the notes that I'm taking?

                - "There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly. But without an immediate experience of failure, there is also not much demand for help. And the publishing market working how it works, there is not much help in supply for this lack of demand either. It is the panic in front of the blank screen that brings students and academic writers to turn to the bookshelves full of self-help books on writing, a market publishers meet in droves by focusing on how to deal with this horse-has-already-left-the-barn situation. If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic and wonder why there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them. And even then, it is more likely that some form of rationalization will cloud the view of the actual reason, which is most likely the difference between good and bad note-taking. “Some people are just like that,” “writing has to be difficult,” “the struggle is part of the deal” are just a few of the mantras that keep too many from inquiring what exactly distinguishes successful writing strategies from less successful ones.

                - "Luckily, this is not the whole story. We know today that self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed. Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long-and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play."

        - Your personal strengths, talents, or other intrinsic skills are less important to your success than doing consistent, smart work. 
            - The right question, then, is to ask - what __is__ the work in my field? On what actions or workflows should I target my daily attention? Which actions, when repeated consistently, will lead to success?
                - In this way, the focus is less on the specific outcomes (what will I produce) than on understanding the general genre of outcome, and focusing on the process that generates outcomes (writing, data analysis, data collection)

                    - "With that in mind, it is not surprising that the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people’s heads, but in the way they do their everyday work. In fact, there is no measurable correlation between a high IQ and academic success–at least not north of 120. Yes, a certain intellectual capacity helps to get into academia, and if you struggle severely with an IQ test, it is likely that you will struggle to solve academic problems, too. But once you are in, a superior IQ will neither help you to distinguish yourself nor protect you from failure. What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand (Duckworth and Seligman, 2005; Tangney, Baumeister, and Boone, 2004)."
