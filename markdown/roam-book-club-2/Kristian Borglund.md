- Great comments from other members in the club:
    - "This is what helps us overcome [the fear of the blank page](((McjPfqJjt))): the question we have to answer as creators shifts from, ‚ÄúWhat do I have to say?‚Äù to ‚ÄúWhat can I see?‚Äù "
        - "like CS Lewis says, originality comes not by aiming at it, but by aiming to tell the truth‚Äîbut telling the truth begins with __seeing__ it"
    - "#Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] Clustering, oh it's such an awesome word. I mean just think about that, without even having to categorize from the top-down, the evident patterns will reveal itself, as long as we stay the course with the creation of many-many Zettels~"
    - "If I thought I wanted to remember what the [[Tunnel Effect]] was (someone else has already created this tag), I would create a tag and would probably write the note something like this: "habit change is more difficult in times of stress because of the [[Tunnel Effect]].""
    - "The thinking about your thinking is one of the reasons why [[Niklas Luhmann]] had these three distinct phases."
    - "mastering note taking as an art is easily the wax on-wax off that leads to the beautiful karate of great writing"
        - "Could another metaphor be that notes in writing are the equivalent of chords in music? (or is the metaphor broken by the fact that there is a finite (?) number of chords while notes are potentially infinite?)"
            - #m I love this metaphor. There are a infinite number of notes, for sure. But there is a finite number of ways to approach note taking, like there are different ways to approach a song. Two professional musicians can play the exact same song in different ways, using different chords.

            - "What are the associations that come to mind?"

        - "Question 2:: #[[Literature Notes]]"
            - "Being informed by what you abstracted, what is the author saying?"
            - "How can you write that in your own words, without summarizing, to prove to yourself that you‚Äôve understood what they are saying?"
            - "Were you able to abstract what the author is saying into your own words?"
        - "Summarize Question 2:: Place this on the block as your `#Literature Notes` ‚Üí next to it"
            - "How would you summarize what you wrote, so you can get a thumbnail understanding in one quick glance, of the larger high resolution thoughts?"
        - "Question 3:: #Zettels"
            - "Being informed by the fleeting notes, the literature notes, and the source to the right, what is the declarative statement that you can say about what you‚Äôve synthesized?"
            - "How can you word this statement in a way that gives you the most clarity in what you mean?"

        - A case for restricting the number of meta-tags used in note-taking / [[Zettelkasten]] / [[Slipbox]] development: Many of the most widespread melodies in the world were created using just four chords. {{[[youtube]]: https://youtu.be/5pidokakU4I}}
        - I'm trying to understand the idea of a [[collective slipbox]] / collective [[zettelkasten]] / [[Collective Zetteling]]; How would that different from, and similar to, how Wikipedia works? Or... is Wikipedia an example of a collective slipbox?

    - "I'm not yet convinced that 'page title contains a statement or claim' is the best way to go"
        - I use subject pages, sub-subject pages etc as well as claim pages. Personally I believe there are situations where using claims / statements as pages are very powerful. Let's say you want to explore a new line of thought, say "Covid-19 is the best that has ever happened to human creativity", OR its opposite: "Covid-19 is the worst that has ever happened to human creativity" (you might want to explore them both to see where it leads you, and generate new insights). You might have 50 of those exploratory lines of thoughts that you can connect to within the next two months while reading other, "unrelated", stuff.
