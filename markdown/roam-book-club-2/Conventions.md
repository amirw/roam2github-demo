- This page is "**A revision in progress**" and will be extended as we move through Book Club 2. 
- ## **Where to write**
    - Please only write in your own page, or in the daily notes page. 
        - Use tags `#`, square brackets `[[ ]]`and attributes `::` liberally 
            - This way your notes will show up as linked references to those pages
                - [[Nick Rvachev]]
                    - I wish there will be a convention how to use tags. E.g. only lower cases. Because I already see duplicates and it's only a start. E.g. #[[smart notes]] and #[[Smart Notes]] and #[[Smart notes]] or #Zettel and #Zettel and #zettel and #zettels and #Zettels
                    - Personally, I believe Roam should have case insensitive tags. Because this same problem always happens in personal graphs as well. I would happy to find that #Writing and #writing will send to the same page.
- ## **Conventions for writing in Daily Notes **
    - Please feel free to write in the Daily Notes page, it will be a fun way to interact with each other through notes. 
    - When writing in the Daily Notes, please write your name first in square brackets. 
        - ** then nest your comments underneath them **
            - e.g. 
            - ^^[[Matt McKinlay]]^^
                - ^^Comment here^^
            - if you do this, and you would like to invite others to comment as well, you can use the hashtag #Chat as a signal next to your name, and to help that thread to surface on filtering, you may also want to load the subject line with descriptor-tags, as needed.
- ## **Chat conventions **
    - When chatting with other members, please use [[Chat guidelines]]
- ## **Block reference other comments as much as possible**
    - In this book club we want to promote block referencing as much as possible.  
        - It will be a great way to see threads develop across blocks and people through the graph. 
        - To block reference any block, right click the bullet point, copy block reference, and paste it into your own page. 
- ## **Tags, pages and attributes **
    - Create your own 
        - Use liberally, write with discoverability in mind
    - Community tags 
        - Preliminary tags, we will add to and adjust these as we move forward
        - #Chat
        - #deepdive
        - #sub (used in conjunction with #Chat, helps filter out things that are clearly sub-chats, not main topics)
- ## **Zetteling conventions **
    - One goal of Book Club 2 is to develop a collective zetteling method for future Books. 
        - We aren't going to have this before we start. We are going to work it out. 
    - So, please start broadly by using adding #zettel to any sentence you think is a zettel. We will refine from this convention as we go.
        - (For Book Club 1 members, please do not use zbc/ convention)
