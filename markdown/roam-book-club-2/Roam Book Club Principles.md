- A brief overview of how to think about what to think about Roam Book Club!

- ## **Experimentation mindset**
    - In collective intelligence 
    - In Roam Multiplayer 
    - In How to Read a Book 
    - Goal is to get better at all of them
- ## **A revision in progress**
    - Things will change. 
    - It's going to be messy.   
    - This is exploring and building together in public 
    - **Expect things to take time**
        - Ancient Greek Heraclitus said, all things are best understood as processes. 
            - A river is not an object, it is water in motion. The sun is not a object, it's a burning fire half way finished. 
        - Roam Book Club is the same. A process that's just starting out. It will look different now to how it looks later. 
        - Enjoy it as a process rather than lament what it isn't yet 
- ## **Book Club is not an online course**
    - It's something different to presenting ideas. 
    - The goal is to allow you to explore the book
        - With other people
        - With different techniques to reading alone
        - To establish and refine technique and practice in reading
- ## **Roam Book Club 2: Home of the epic Zettel**
    - A lot of people are increasingly aware of what a zettel is. A lot of people are aware of How to Take Smart Notes.
        - Not as many know how to use it as a technique. 
        - Even less consistently do 
        - Zetteling at risk of becoming jargon monoxide
    - We aim here to collectively explore and learn technique. 
    - Can we facilitate [zetteling virtuosity? ](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Athletes_and_musicians_pursue_virtuosity_in_fundamental_skills_much_more_rigorously_than_knowledge_workers_do)
        - Daily practice. Help build habits? 
            - With Zettels and with Roam.
- ## **Chance favors the connected mind**
    - __A person is a person through other people__
    - [[Descartes]] was wrong when he said "I think therefore I am" #quote
        - Ideas are not conceived in the mind of a genius and delivered to the world.
        - Interaction creates ideas. 
        - Interaction creates people. 
    - The idea of a scenius created by Brian Eno is a better mode.
        - Genius is intelligence and the intuition of a whole cultural scene
    - Roam Book Club aims to connect you to other Roamans and gives a chance to work on cool ideas. That might be all you need for genius.
        - Connect with talking in live sessions
        - Connect in words in the graph
- ## **Create a world, not just encounter it**
    - For many of us, Roam is a mindset shift more than a software product.
    - It's a tool for thought that is changing how we think.
        - It's also ostensible. It changes to you too. No hierachies, no manuals, no permissions. 
            - The default mode of book club is to ask you to embrace a mindset of doing stuff rather than asking for permission. 
                - Create tags, use attributes, for the most part, do whatever you want.  No wrong answers. No fear of retribution. Death to insider knowledge. Death to achievement as compliance. There are no mistakes. 
    - Easy to play, hard to master
        - But one of the conclusions from book club 1, is that some standards improve interactions. 
            - We will set a minimum set of rules 
                - Write in your own page, and daily notes only 
            - And we will develop our tags, titles etc will evolve adbductively as we go 
- ## **Have fun and be nice**
    - Be f@%cking nice!  
        - Roam Book Club 1 was a very positive experience. Roam Cult also one of the most helpful and positive places on the internet. RBC 2 aiming to be the same.
            - Being nice is very underrated 
                - Cynicism sounds thoughtful sometimes, but it's almost always not. Hard avoid.
    - Have fun! 
        - Have a default position of assuming goodwill of others
