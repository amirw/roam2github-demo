- [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
    - [[Goals for Book Club]]
        - Learn how to use the tool
            - Learn new tips and tricks in Roam.
            - Get a taste for what multiplayer Roam usage is like.
        - Change the way I read
            - Reading with the knowledge that you will be creating smart notes from it changes the way you read.
            - Perhaps this will increase my retention of the material. #[[Memory Retention]]
        - Change the way I think
        - See how others implement the principles in the book.
        - Build up a knowledge graph for the book that can be used as input for recording YouTube videos about the content, making it accessible to a wider audience.
        - Form better reading habits
            - Elaboration, putting things in my own words.
            - Being aware that what I write will be lost if not tied to an appropriate context
- [[Book Club Live Session 2]]
    - [[Session 1 Writing task]]
        - "Reflection on first reading phase of the book "
            - "What ideas resonate with you from the book"
                - "What is the gist of the book? "
                    - If people take notes in a smarter way, they will not waste that time with notes they don't look at again.
                    - Notes can be taken in a way that builds up a networked graph of insights that can be aid in thinking and in linear writing.
            - "Discuss the fleeting note phase"
                - "What does the concept of fleeting notes mean to you? "
                    - An external record of an idea that a book sparked in your mind but that isn't fully baked.
                    - Sometimes something you are reading reminds you of another idea only tangentially related.  It wouldn't make sense to let this one idea hijack the current book or that books notes, but you don't want to lose it and want the flexibility to come back to it later to refine.
                - "Define a fleeting note in your own words. "
                    - A placeholder for possible later refinement of an idea.
                - "How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method."
                    - I highlighted in Kindle and synced to Roam via Readwise.  Then I came back and bolded and tagged the ideas.
                    - I didn't put things in my own words for the most part, so that is the next step for me.
                    - Sometimes I expanded on my thoughts in bullets underneath the synced highlight.
                    - I didn't have these references in the appropriate headings in the book, so they lost some context.
                - "What is the value of fleeting notes?  For this book, and for previous books you have read? "
                    - First pass external memory when insight strikes, but must be refined and elaborated in own words before the context is lost.

    - 
- Fleeting Notes:: 
    - My fleeting notes are a mess and are mostly just in the form of synced highlights without commentary.  Need to improve on this.
    - Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of a mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory. Psychologists call this mechanism [[Active Inhibition]] (cf. MacLeod, 2007). It is easy to understand what it is good for: Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings. That is what Shereshevsky struggled with in his life: There were moment where he tried to buy an ice cream, but some random word of the vendor triggered such an enormous amount of associations and memories that he would have to leave the shop, so overwhelming was this experience. [*](((l3Z_t0R9K))) ([Location 1847](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1847))
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Forgetting things temporarily is a gift, a skill even, allowing us to focus.
    - **Writing plays such a central role in learning**, studying and research that it is surprising how little we think about it. ([Location 119](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=119)) #Learning
    - **Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.** ([Location 134](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=134)) #Writing
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Is this at all related to [[The medium is the message]]?
    - But moreover, it describes how he implemented them into his workflow so he could honestly say: “I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.” **A good structure allows you to do that, to move seamlessly from one task to another – without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture.** ([Location 188](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=188)) #[[Context Switching]]
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Reminds me of programming and the work that is necessary to save state and jump to a distraction.  Some of that would exist when jumping from topic to topic in research, but smart notes allow you to more easily save state and remember the context when you come back.
    - **A good structure enables flow**, the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes effortless (Csikszentmihalyi, 1975). ([Location 195](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=195)) #Flow
    - Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also **unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement – which we ideally have on a regular basis** and not just as an exception. Even though planning is often at odds with the very idea of research and learning, it is the mantra of most study guides and self-help books on academic writing. **How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated?** ([Location 201](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=201)) #Insight
    - We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery – or insight. ([Location 208](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=208))
    - Planners are also unlikely to continue with their studies after they finish their examinations. They are rather glad it is over. **Experts, on the other hand, would not even consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved to be rewarding and fun: learning in a way that generates real insight, is accumulative and sparks new ideas.** ([Location 212](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=212))
    - Good students also look beyond the obvious. They peek over the fences of their own disciplines – and once you have done that, you cannot go back and do what everyone else is doing, even if you now must deal with heterogeneous ideas that come without a manual on how they might fit together. ([Location 222](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=222)) #Range #[[Cross-Disciplinary]]
        - **Note**: Impact of networked databases across disciplines. Increased range and ideas across silos.
    - In psychology, this is known as the [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]] (Kruger and Dunning, 1999). **Poor students lack insight into their own limitations** – as they would have to know about the vast amount of knowledge out there to be able to see how little they know in comparison. ([Location 229](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=229)) #[[Cognitive Biases]]
    - That means that **those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities**. ([Location 231](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=231))
    - **This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome**, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are (Clance and Imes 1978; Brems et al. 1994). ([Location 236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=236)) #[[Imposter Syndrome]]
    - Unfortunately, David Allen’s technique cannot simply be transferred to the task of insightful writing. The first reason is that **GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition**. ([Location 281](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=281)) #GTD #Insight
    - Writing that aims at insight must therefore be organised in a much more open manner. ([Location 284](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=284)) #Insight #Learning
    - **Writing is not a linear process**. We constantly have to jump back and forth between different tasks. ([Location 290](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=290)) #[[Circuitous Path]] #Learning
    - **His slip-box became his dialogue partner**, main idea generator and productivity engine. It helped him to structure and develop his thoughts. ([Location 322](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=322))
        - **Note**: Imagine having a conversation with Siri that is a mix of your own thoughts and finding sources and answering questions.
    - Only if the work is set up in a way that is **flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments** can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned – which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work. ([Location 377](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=377))
    - Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of **smart working environments** that avoid resistance in the first place ([Location 381](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=381))
    - The third and maybe the most important reason is the very fact that it is simple. **Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas.** They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means. ([Location 402](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=402))
    - Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side (Schmidt 2013, 170). These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box. ([Location 419](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=419))
    - He usually wrote his notes with an eye towards already existing notes in the slip-box. And **while the notes on the literature were brief, he wrote them with great care**, not much different from his style in the final manuscript: in full sentences and with explicit references to the literature from which he drew his material. ([Location 425](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=425))
    - He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but **made a transition from one context to another**. ([Location 431](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=431))
    - The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. ([Location 435](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=435))
    - The numbers bore no meaning and were only there to identify each note permanently. ([Location 436](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=436))
    - **Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have.** ([Location 494](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=494))
    - If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. **If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words.** ([Location 496](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=496))
    - Neuroscientists, psychologists and other experts on thinking have very different ideas about how our brains work, but, as Levy writes: “no matter how internal processes are implemented, (you) need to understand the extent to which **the mind is reliant upon external scaffolding.**” (2011, 270) If there is one thing the experts agree on, then it is this: **You have to externalise your ideas, you have to write.** ([Location 500](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=500))
    - [[Richard Feynman]] stresses it as much as [[Benjamin Franklin]]. ([Location 503](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=503)) #Writing
        - **Note**: Look up Feynman and Franklin on writing 
    - 1. Make fleeting notes. ([Location 510](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=510))
    - Put them into one place, which you define as your inbox, and process them later. ([Location 513](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=513))
    - 2. Make literature notes. ([Location 516](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=516))
    - Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and **use your own words**. ([Location 518](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=518))
    - 3. Make permanent notes. ([Location 520](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=520)) #[[Head Page]]
    - **Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else**: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible. Throw away the fleeting notes from step one and put the literature notes from step two into your reference system. You can forget about them now. All that matters is going into the slip-box. ([Location 525](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=525))
    - In reality, **you never work on just one idea**, but **many ideas in different stages at the same time**. ([Location 560](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=560))
    - Gather what you encounter along your way and don’t let any good idea go to waste. ([Location 563](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=563))
    - Imagine if we went through life learning only what we planned to learn or being explicitly taught. ([Location 580](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=580))
    - There is this story where NASA tried to figure out how to make a ballpoint pen that works in space. If you have ever tried to use a ballpoint pen over your head, you have probably realised it is gravity that keeps the ink flowing. After a series of prototypes, several test runs and tons of money invested, NASA developed a fully functional gravity-independent pen, which pushes the ink onto the paper by means of compressed nitrogen. According to this story, the Russians faced the same problem. So they used pencils (De Bono, 1998, 141). ([Location 590](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=590)) #[[Story Telling Material]] #[[Story Telling]]
    - Good tools do not add features and more options to what we already have, but help to reduce distractions from the main work, which here is thinking. ([Location 612](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=612))
    - To have an undistracted brain to think with and a reliable collection of notes to think in is pretty much all we need. Everything else is just clutter. ([Location 615](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=615))
    - If you use other tools, make sure everything ends up in one place, a central inbox or something like that, where you can process it soon, ideally within a day. ([Location 633](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=633))
    - And even though there are clear benefits of handwriting (cf. below chapter 3.2.1), I recommend using the digital version, if only for mobility. ([Location 649](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=649)) #Handwriting
    - You can look up for yourself some of his notes on their website.[12] Soon, you will be able to access the whole digitalised slip-box online. ([Location 675](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=675))
    - Studying does not prepare students for independent research. It is independent research. ([Location 702](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=702))
    - There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. ([Location 705](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=705)) #Incentives #Research
        - **Note**: Getting credit is an incentive to share knowledge.
    - Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. This is why the presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin (Peters and Schäfer 2006, 9). If writing is the medium of research and studying nothing else than research, then there is no reason not to **work as if nothing else counts than writing**. ([Location 718](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=718)) #Writing #Research
    - You will not waste your time with the attempt to figure out what you “should” learn. Rather, you will try to learn as efficiently as possible so you can **quickly get to the point where actual open questions arise, as these are the only questions worth writing about**. ([Location 729](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=729)) #Research #Learning
    - **It will change the way you read** as well: You will become more focused on the most relevant aspects, knowing that you cannot write down everything. **You will read in a more engaged way, because you cannot rephrase anything in your own words if you don’t understand what it is about**. ([Location 733](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=733)) #Learning
    - Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing (cf. Anders Ericsson, 2008). ([Location 737](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=737))
    - Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing. ([Location 738](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=738))
    - But **more often than not, it is the simplicity of an idea that makes it so powerful** (and often overlooked in the beginning). ([Location 745](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=745)) #Insight
        - **Note**: Reference Taleb on this same concept.
    - **In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?** ([Location 787](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=787))
    - Most students sort their material by topic or even by seminars and semester. From the perspective of someone who writes, that makes as much sense as sorting your errands by purchase date and the store they were bought from. Can’t find your trousers? Maybe they are with the bleach you bought the same day at your department store. ([Location 788](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=788))
    - The slip-box is designed to **present you with ideas you have already forgotten**, allowing your brain to focus on thinking instead of remembering. ([Location 797](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=797))
    - The collection of good ideas is diluted to insignificance by all the other notes, which are only relevant for a specific project or actually not that good on second sight. ([Location 818](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=818))
    - If you already know that you will not go back to them, don’t take these kind of notes in the first place. ([Location 843](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=843))
    - **Fleeting notes are only useful if you review them within a day or so and turn them into proper notes you can use later**. ([Location 844](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=844))
    - **Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from**. ([Location 848](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=848))
    - The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, **the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones** – and the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort. ([Location 835](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=835))
    - Almost always, the decision on the topic is presented as the necessary first step, ([Location 910](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=910))
    - Writing can’t be that linear. The obvious question is: If that is true, why not root the course of action in reality instead? ([Location 917](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=917))
    - [[Hermeneutic Circle]] ([Location 923](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=923))
    - It is misleading if it means that you could make a sound plan on what to write before you have immersed yourself in the topics at hand, which involves writing. ([Location 928](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=928))
    - We have to read with a pen in hand, develop ideas on paper and build up an ever-growing pool of externalised thoughts. ([Location 929](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=929))
    - Seeking feedback, not avoiding it, is the first virtue of anyone who wants to learn, or in the more general terms of psychologist **Carol Dweck**, to grow. Dweck shows convincingly that the most reliable predictor for long-term success is having a “growth [[Mindset]].” ([Location 1009](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1009))
    - ### New highlights added [[October 4th, 2020]] at 3:14 PM
    - Yes, our ability to learn isolated facts is indeed limited and probably decreases with age. But **if facts** are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but **hang together in a network of ideas,** or “latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994), **it becomes easier to make sense of new information**. ([Location 1056](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1056))
    - The Six Steps to Successful Writing ([Location 1066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1066))
    - 9.1      Give Each Task Your Undivided Attention ([Location 1071](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1071))
    - We know for example that watching television reduces the attention span of children (Swing et al. 2010). We also know that **the average length of TV soundbites has steadily declined over the last several decades** (Fehrmann, 2011). During the U.S. presidential election in 1968, the average soundbite — that is, any footage of a candidate speaking uninterrupted — was still a little more than 40 seconds, but that had fallen to less than 10 seconds at the end of the 80s (Hallin 1994) and 7.8 seconds in 2000 (Lichter, 2001). ([Location 1078](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1078)) #[[Changes in Politics]] #Attention #Focus
    - 9.2      Multitasking is not a good idea ([Location 1085](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1085))
    - Psychologists who interviewed the multitaskers did test them instead of just asking. They gave them different tasks to accomplish and compared their results with another group that was instructed to do only one thing at a time. The outcome is unambiguous: **While those who multitasked felt more productive, their productivity actually decreased – a lot** (Wang and Tchernev 2012; Rosen 2008; Ophir, Nass, and Wagner 2009). Not only the quantity but also the quality of their accomplishments lagged significantly behind that of the control group.

    - “**(An) exclusive use of analytical rationality tends to impede further improvement in human performance because of analytical rationality’s slow reasoning** and its emphasis on rules, principles, and universal solutions. Second, bodily involvement, speed, and an intimate knowledge of concrete cases in the form of good examples is a prerequisite for true expertise.” (Flyvbjerg 2001, 15) ([Location 1199](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1199))

    - **Experts**, on the other hand, **have internalised the necessary knowledge so they don’t have to actively remember rules or think consciously about their choices**. They have acquired enough experience in various situations to be able to **rely on their intuition** to know what to do in which kind of situation. Their decisions in complex situations are explicitly not made by long rational-analytical considerations, but rather come from the gut (cf. Gigerenzer, 2008a, 2008b).

    - The workflow around the slip-box is not a prescription that tells you what to do at what stage of writing. On the contrary: It gives you a structure of clearly separable tasks, which can be completed within reasonable time and provides you with instant feedback through interconnected writing tasks. **It allows you to become better by giving you the opportunity for deliberate practice.** ([Location 1251](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1251)) #[[Deliberate Practice]]

And above all: What does x mean for y? These questions not only increase our understanding, but facilitate learning as well. Once we make a meaningful connection to an idea or fact, it is difficult not to remember it when we think about what it is connected with.

    - **The smartest way to deal with this kind of limitation is to cheat**. Instead of forcing ourselves to do something we don’t feel like doing, we need to find a way to make us feel like doing what moves our project further along. Doing the work that need to be done without having to apply too much willpower requires a technique, a ruse.

    - We can have breaks without fear of losing the thread. **Breaks are much more than just opportunities to recover. They are crucial for learning.

    - **To get a good paper written, you only have to rewrite a good draft; to get a good draft written, you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text.

    - Translating means to give the truest possible account of the original work, using different words – it does not mean the freedom to make something fit. As well, **the mere copying of quotes almost always changes their meaning by stripping them out of context**, even though the words aren’t changed. This is a common beginner mistake, which can only lead to a patchwork of ideas, but never a coherent thought.

    - **Handwriting is slower** and can’t be corrected as quickly as electronic notes. **Because students can’t write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details.** ([Location 1441](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1441))
    - The classic role model would be **Charles Darwin**. He forced himself to write down (and therefore elaborate on) the arguments that were the most critical of his theories. **“I had [...] during many years followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favorable ones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were raised against my views, which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer.”** (Darwin 1958, 123) ([Location 1472](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1472))
    - **Developing arguments and ideas bottom-up instead of top-down** is the first and most important step to opening ourselves up for insight. ([Location 1490](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1490))
    - And as soon we focus on the content of the slip-box, **dis-confirming data becomes suddenly very attractive, because it opens up more possible connections and discussions within the slip-box**, while mere confirming data does not.

        - **Note**: Train yourself to not feel good when ignoring inconsistencies.  This can involve playing mental games, reframing something that feels bad due to implications for deeply held beliefs or facing personal flaws.

When insight comes, the brain is quick to declare it brilliant and skip the next levels of analysis that often reveal inconsistencies of thought.

    - There is a reason why the best scientists are also often very good teachers. For someone like Richard Feynman, everything was about understanding, regardless of whether he was doing research or teaching. His famous Feynman diagrams are primarily tools to make understanding easier and his lectures are famous because they help students to really understand physics. It is not surprising, therefore, that he was passionate about challenging traditional education methods. He couldn’t stand textbooks full of pseudo-explanations (Feynman 1985) and teachers who tried to make learning easier for students by using artificial “real-life” examples instead of using their actual prior understanding as a connection point (Feynman 1963). ([Location 1933](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1933))
        - **Note**: Get this fire and passion for improving teaching and learning.

    - Keywords should always be assigned with an eye towards the topics you are working on or interested in, never by looking at the note in isolation. ([Location 2046](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2046))
    - On a note like this, you can collect links to other relevant notes to this topic or question, preferably with a short indication of what to find on these notes (one or two words or a short sentence is sufficient). ([Location 2066](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2066))
        - **Note**: In Roam, it may be good to summarize the page at the top so the automatic back links start with that summary.
    - If you use the slip-box for a while, you will inevitably make a sobering discovery: The great new idea you are about to add to the slip-box turns out to be already in there. Even worse, chances are this idea wasn’t even yours, but someone else’s. Having the same thought twice or mistaking another person’s idea with our own is far from unusual. ([Location 2111](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2111))
    - Sometimes, the confrontation with old notes helps to detect differences we wouldn’t have noticed otherwise. What seems to be the same idea sometimes turns out to be slightly, but crucially, different. We then can explicitly discuss this difference on another note. ([Location 2117](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2117))
    - Albert Rothenberg suggests that the construction of oppositions is the most reliable way of generating new ideas (Rothenberg 1971; 1996; 2015). ([Location 2130](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2130))

    - Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s partner and vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, stresses the importance of having a broad theoretical toolbox – not to be a good academic, but to have a good, pragmatic grip on reality. He regularly explains to students which mental models have proven most useful to help him understand markets and human behaviour. He advocates looking out for the most powerful concepts in every discipline and to try to understand them so thoroughly that they become part of our thinking. ([Location 2162](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2162))

    - We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications (elaboration), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times (spacing) in different contexts (variation), ideally with the help of chance (contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort (retrieval). ([Location 2202](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2202))
    - Even sudden breakthroughs are usually preceded by a long, intense process of preparation. ([Location 2219](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2219))
    - Most often, innovation is not the result of a sudden moment of realization, anyway, but incremental steps toward improvement. Even groundbreaking paradigm shifts are most often the consequence of many small moves in the right direction instead of one big idea. This is why the search for small differences is key. ([Location 2236](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2236))
    - The brain is more likely to notice details when it scans than when it focuses.” (Zull 2002, 142f) ([Location 2247](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2247))
    - To be able to play with ideas, we first have to liberate them from their original context by means of abstraction and re-specification. We did this when we took literature notes and translated them into the different contexts within the slip-box. Abstraction does not have a good reputation at the moment. It is the tangible, the concrete that is cheered for. Abstraction should indeed not be the final goal of thinking, but it is a necessary in-between step to make heterogeneous ideas compatible. If Darwin had never abstracted from his concrete observations of sparrows, he would never have found an abstract, a general principle of evolution across different species, and he would never have been able to see how evolution works in other species as well. Abstraction is also not for theoretical-academic processes of insight only. We need to abstract from concrete situations every day. Only by abstraction and re-specification can we apply ideas in the singular and always different situations in reality (Loewenstein, 2010). ([Location 2256](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2256))
    - Usually, we don’t even notice when our brains modify our surroundings to make it fit its expectations. We need therefore a bit of a ruse to break the power of thinking routines. In their book with the showy title “The 5 Elements of Effective Thinking”, the mathematicians Edward B. Burger and Michael Starbird collected different strategies to do that (2012). ([Location 2285](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2285))
    - One of the most famous figures to illustrate this skill is the mathematician Abraham Wald (Mangel and Samaniego 1984). During World War II, he was asked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that were most often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour. But instead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommended armouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits. The RAF forgot to take into account what was not there to see: All the planes that didn’t make it back. ([Location 2311](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2311))

    - Sometimes, it is more important to rediscover the problems for which we already have a solution than to think solely about the problems that are present to us. ([Location 2334](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2334))
    - What kind of answer can you expect from asking a question in this particular way? What is missing? ([Location 2338](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2338))
    - But the only thing Warren Buffett thinks about it is the relationship between price and value – he doesn’t even look at the price from yesterday. He understands that simple is not the same as easy, and that the worst thing you can do is to make a simple task unnecessarily complicated.

        - **Note**: Simple isn’t Easy.  [[Rich Hickey]]
    - And even though the digital program lifts the physical restrictions on the length of a note, I highly recommend treating a digital note as if the space were limited. By restricting ourselves to one format, we also restrict ourselves to just one idea per note and force ourselves to be as precise and brief as possible. ([Location 2370](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2370))
    - The restriction to one idea per note is also the precondition to recombine them freely later. ([Location 2372](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2372))
    - In his book “The Paradox of Choice,” Barry Schwartz used numerous examples, from shopping to career options to romance, to show that less choice can not only increase our productivity, but also our freedom and make it easier to be in the moment and enjoy it (Schwartz, 2007). ([Location 2383](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2383))
    - We are restricted to the use of only 26 letters, but what that enables us to do! We can write novels, theories, love letters or court orders – just by rearranging these 26 letters. This is certainly not possible despite the restriction to 26 letters, but because of it. ([Location 2393](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2393))
    - The binary code is radically more limited than the alphabet as it contains only two states, one or zero, but it opened up a range of creative possibilities that is unprecedented. ([Location 2401](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2401))
    - Without structure, we cannot differentiate, compare or experiment with ideas. ([Location 2404](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2404))
        - **Note**: Good to think about for [[Havdalah]]
    - ‘An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily available to you.’” (Charles T. Munger) ([Location 2430](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2430))
    - The brain more easily remembers information that it encountered recently, which has emotions attached to it and is lively, concrete or specific. Ideally, it rhymes as well (cf. Schacter, 2001; Schacter, Chiao and Mitchell, 2003). ([Location 2440](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2440))
        - **Note**: Look up Judaism’s use of mnemonics to aid in memory.
    - we tend to like our first ideas the best and are very reluctant to let go of them, irrespective of their actual relevance (Strack and Mussweiler 1997). ([Location 2444](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2444))
        - **Note**: [[Cognitive Biases]]
    - More people in a brainstorming group usually come up with less good ideas and restrict themselves inadvertently to a narrower range of topics (Mullen, Johnson, and Salas 1991).[38] ([Location 2446](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2446))
    - The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic. ([Location 158](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=158))
    - This is how evolution works: by trial and error, not planning. ([Location 2477](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2477))
    - we cannot break with a certain way of thinking if we are not even aware that it is a certain way of thinking (Dean, 2013). ([Location 2499](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2499))
    - When even highly intelligent students fail in their studies, it’s most often because they cease to see the meaning in what they were supposed to learn (cf. Balduf 2009), are unable to make a connection to their personal goals (Glynn et al. 2009) or lack the ability to control their own studies autonomously and on their own terms (Reeve and Jan, 2006; Reeve, 2009). ([Location 2505](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2505))
    - The ability to keep control over our work and change course if necessary is made possible by the fact that the big task of “writing a text” is broken down into small, concrete tasks, which allows us practically to do exactly what is needed at a certain time and take the next step from there. ([Location 2524](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2524))
    - A key point: Structure the text and keep it flexible. ([Location 2543](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2543))
    - The problem in this stage is almost exactly the opposite of the “blank screen.” Instead of not knowing how to fill the pages, we have so much at hand that we have to curb our impulse to mention everything at the same time. ([Location 2548](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2548))
    - The process of reading and writing inevitably produces a lot of unintended by-products. Not all ideas can fit into the same article, and only a fraction of the information we encounter is useful for one particular project. ([Location 2561](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2561))
    - It is like martial arts: If you encounter resistance or an opposing force, you should not push against it, but redirect it towards another productive goal. The slip-box will always provide you with multiple possibilities. ([Location 2573](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2573))
    - Even the people who study this phenomenon, which is called the overconfidence bias, admit that they too fall for it (Kahneman 2013, 245ff). ([Location 2601](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2601))
    - The lesson to draw is to be generally sceptical about planning, especially if it is merely focused on the outcome, not on the actual work and the steps required to achieve a goal. ([Location 2602](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2602))
    - If we instead set out to write, say, three notes on a specific day, review one paragraph we wrote the day before or check all the literature we discovered in an article, we know exactly at the end of the day what we were able to accomplish and can adjust our expectations for the next day. ([Location 2618](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2618))
    - Getting hundreds of these cases of feedback over the course of a year will make us much more likely to learn from them and to become more realistic about our productivity than if we just miss a deadline once in a while, which, of course, will not happen again – until next time. ([Location 2620](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2620))
    - According to the famous law of Parkinson, every kind of work tends to fill the time we set aside for it, like air fills every corner of a room (Parkinson 1957). ([Location 2625](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2625))
    - It is much easier to get started if the next step is as feasible as “writing a note,” “collect what is interesting in this paper” or “turning this series of notes into a paragraph” than if we decide to spend the next days with a vague and ill-defined task like “keep working on that overdue paper.” ([Location 2631](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2631))
    - Slavoj Žižek said in an interview[41] that he wouldn’t be able to write a single sentence if he didn’t start by convincing himself he was only writing down some ideas for himself, and that maybe he could turn it into something publishable later. By the time he stopped writing, he was always surprised to find that the only thing left to do was revise the draft he already had. ([Location 2643](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2643))
        - **Note**: [[Cognitive Tricks]]
    - The goal here is to get into the habit of fetching pen and paper whenever we read something, to write down the most important and interesting aspects. If we manage to establish a routine in this first step, it becomes much easier to develop the urge to turn these findings into permanent notes and connect them with other notes in the slip-box. ([Location 2680](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2680))
    - “technology, acceptance problems” ([Location 2690](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2690))
        - **Note**: Think about your naming convention before you get too far.  Multiple tags may be best for this.
    - That it is not just a tool to write more efficiently, but also a training device for serious long-term learning, should have been obvious to me, but wasn’t. ([Location 2693](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=2693))

            - Forgetting, then, would not be the loss of a memory, but the erection of a mental barrier between the conscious mind and our long-term memory. Psychologists call this mechanism [[Active Inhibition]] (cf. MacLeod, 2007). It is easy to understand what it is good for: Without a very thorough filter, our brains would constantly be flooded by memories, making it impossible to focus on anything in our surroundings. That is what Shereshevsky struggled with in his life: There were moment where he tried to buy an ice cream, but some random word of the vendor triggered such an enormous amount of associations and memories that he would have to leave the shop, so overwhelming was this experience.
