- **Literature notes:**
- [[Introduction]]
    - Key topics: [[How to hack willpower]] [[How to be productive]] [[How to not get writer's block]]
        - pg 3: #preparation #howtowrite "To Sum it up: The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on __what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic__"
        - pg 4: #willpower "Willpower is, as far as we know today, a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term"
        - pg 5: #willpower #environment "Self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our __environment__ than with ourselves"
            - nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn't one around
        - pg 5: "Having a meaningful and well-defined #task beats #willpower every time. Not __having__ willpower, but __not having to use__ willpower indicates that you set yourself up for #success"
- [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
    - Key topics: [[what is good structure]] [[get out of your head]] [[flow state]] [[structure vs. plan]] [[effortless]] [[externalization]] [[slip-box]]
        -  Luhmann's [[effortless]] [[productivity]]
            - Pg 5: "I never force myself to do anything I don't feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else" 
                - "A [[good structure]] allows you to move seamlessly from one task to another without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture"
                    - How to add good structure to my entire day (beyond a project or research)? So that when I get bored of doing something, I can move to something else, but without it becoming a #distraction and impeding #productivity?
            - Pg 15: "I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else"
        - pg 5: "A [[good structure]] is something you can [[trust]]. It relieves you from the burden of remember and keeping track of everything. If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together__ in you head__ and you can start focusing on what is important: the content"
        - pg 6: "A [[good structure]] enables [[flow]], the state in which you get so completely immersed in your work that you lose track of time and can just keep on going as the work becomes #effortless"
            - [[flow]] doesn't happen by [[chance]]; it is rooted in the [[framework]]
                - when you have a good framework, you can turn off your [[monkey brain]] because you don't have to constantly [[judge]] or [[assess]] the process
                - if you can turn off [[metacognition]], then you can focus on the content and the ideas
                - if you turn off your [[self-perception]], then you have moved past your 'self', identity, time, space, and enter #flow
        - pg 6: "Having a clear #structure to work __in__ is completely different from making plans __about__ something" because if you make a plan, "you impose a structure __on yourself__" which "makes you inflexible"
            - to keep according to plan, you need to push yourself and employ #willpower
        - Pg 6: Research, thinking, or studying is an [[open-ended process]]
        - Pg 8: The [[Dunning-Kruger effect]] describes the phenomenon when those are not very good at something are overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities
            - Pg 8: [[Dunning-Kruger effect]] also explains [[imposter syndrome]]
        - Pg 10: [[David Allen]]'s [[Getting Things Done]] also illustrates the importance of an overarching workflow in maximizing productivity
            - The workflow enables one to empty one's mind of constant distractions and thoughts generated to evaluate next steps and process, and experience [[mind like water]]
        - Pg 16: [[effortless]] means not needing [[willpower]]
            - "[[success]] is not the result of strong [[willpower]] and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of [[smart working environments]] that avoid resistance in the first place"
        - Pg 17: successful writing and learning requires an [[external system]] to think in an organize thoughts
            - Pg 23: "no matter how internal processes are implemented, you need to understand the extent to which the mind is reliant upon [[external scaffolding]]"
- [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
    - Key topics: [[how to write a paper with the slip-box]] [[Meno's paradox]] [[bottom up]]
        - The process consists of 3 types of notes and an index
            - "[[Fleeting Notes]] are half-baked thoughts that you have while doing something else"
                - these should be jotted down in a centralized system and reviewed within 1-2 days so that their context and meaning aren't lost
                - [[Fleeting Notes]] are half-baked thoughts that you have while doing something else
                - once reviewed (and possibly converted to a proper permanent state and inserted in the slip-box), they are discarded
            - "[[literature notes]] are made when reading something that you don't want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing"
                - [[literature notes]] are made when reading something that you don't want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing
                - these should be short, selective, and in your own words
                - these should include bibliographic details so that the reference is readily available
            - "[[Permanent Notes]] is when the magic happens by reviewing [[Fleeting Notes]] and [[literature notes]] and thinking about how they related to what is relevant to your research, thinking, writing, aka what is already in your [[slip-box]]"
                - [[Permanent Notes]] is when the magic happens by reviewing [[Fleeting Notes]] and [[literature notes]] and thinking about how they related to what is relevant to your research, thinking, writing, aka what is already in your [[slip-box]]
                - Pg 24: " the idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments, and discussions"
                - write exactly one note for each idea
                - these should be written like you are writing for someone else: full sentences, disclose sources, make references, be as precise, clear, and brief as possible
                - adding to the slip-box: file the new permanent note behind one or more related existing notes
                - link to [[index]] to make this note discoverable
            - developing topics will be a [[bottom up]] process (not top down)
                - after some time of creating permanent notes, you'll end up with developed (and substantiated) ideas, but you don't need to wait until you have everything together to start writing, and instead, you should try ideas out and give yourself enough time to go back and re-iterate the note-taking process
            - Pg 26: [[Meno's paradox]] it's unlikely that every text you read will contain exactly the information you need; otherwise, you must have already known what was in there and wouldn't have had reason to read it in the first place
                - the only way to find out if something is worth reading, is by reading it
                - even if a text isn't perfectly aligned to your "idea" it is still a good exercise to make permanent notes so that you can accumulate more critical mass that can lead to new insight
- [[Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have]]
    - pg 23: focus on the essentials and don't complicate things
        - NASA spent a lot of time and resources in developing a gravity-defying pen, whereas the Russians just used a pencil
- [[Chapter 4. A Few Things to Keep in Mind]]
    - Pg 32: don't let the slip-box become a #graveyard for thoughts
- [[The Four Underlying Principles]]
- [[Chapter 5. Writing is the Only Thing That Matters]]
    - Key topics: do everything as if nothing counts other than writing [[deliberate practice]]
        - Pg 36: #studying is #research becaus e it's about gaining #insight that cannot be anticipated
        - Pg 36: there is no such thing as #private knowledge in academia
            - an idea kept #private is as good as one you never had
                - there is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas
            - in order to make something #public it must be #written 
        - pg 38: #Writing is making [[deliberate practice]] of learning
- [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
    - Key topics: [[paradigm shift]] [[self-reinforcing positive feedback loop]] [[in which context will i want to stumble upon it again?]] 
        - The story of McLean who revolutionized container shipping illustrates that an idea is only as good as the structure and framework in which it resides
            - Pg 40: "only after aligning every single part of the delivery chain, from packaging to delivery, from the design of the ships to the design of the harbors, was the full potential fo the container unleashed"
            - Likewise, you can't expect the slip-box to work within the context of the old paradigm of note-taking (underlining, margin noting, excerpt writing)
        - Pg 40: when the advantages of the containers became obvious, there were second-order effects that came into play and went into self-reinforcing the [[positive feedback loop]]
            - the slip-box is a built-in feedback loop because it forces every new idea or information to be understood in the context of the existing mind map
        - Pg 41: instead of organizing thoughts by topic, the slip-box lets you standardize every bit of information into the same format so insight can develop [[bottom up]]
            - while the slip-box's bottom up method does not have the trade-off problem between too-few or too-many topics, it can lose value when notes are added indiscriminately 
            - that's why there are 3 types of notes
                - "[[Fleeting Notes]] are half-baked thoughts that you have while doing something else"
                - "[[Permanent Notes]] is when the magic happens by reviewing [[Fleeting Notes]] and [[literature notes]] and thinking about how they related to what is relevant to your research, thinking, writing, aka what is already in your [[slip-box]]"
                - [[project notes]] are self-explanatory, only relevant to one particular project so kept in a specific project folder and can be discarded once the project is over
