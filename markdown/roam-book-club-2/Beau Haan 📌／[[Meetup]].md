                            - I'm still contemplating Roam as either a real Second brain that can hold everything, thoughts, info,references,notes,resources,etc or more like a zettel/smart permanent notes only 
I'm wondering not only what's the right structure but also if Roam can technically hold it without breaking over time #thought
                            - Ideally I would like to see it as scrapbook for everything , like Leonardo Da Vinci had where you can literally mindump 24/7 
                            - and the organisation can happen intentionally or by serendipity
                            - Like a Quantum version of your Digital Brain where you can have multiple simulteanous interconnections of bytes of thoughts and info #thought
                            - API could help, like you already have with readwise
of you could go with a walling,evernote,notion as second digital brain

                            - But Roam is the "source code"version that is the closest to a neuron/brain like data thinking structure #thought
