    - [[Introduction]]
        - writing to organise thoughts and to exchange ideas (communication)
        - externalising the internal with words to communicate the internal [[train/jumble of thoughts]] in a meaningful way
        - "improving the __organisation__ of all writing makes a difference"
        - "the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development"
            - the conjuring of the thought with words internally = stating point
        - "build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way"
            - You can use this pool of notes not only to make
writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also
to learn for the long run and generate new ideas
            - YES please
        - We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly.
But without an immediate experience of failure, there is also not much demand for help
            - How true. I found that it took practice and mental discipline for a while to develop thoughts into coherent spoken word, writing it down (especially the academic writing I am gradually becoming accustomed to) requires yet another level of refining
            - [[Conciseness]] is the name of the game
            - Mum was very much an advocate of 'if you can say it in one word, don't say it in three' type of communication
            - [[Scientific writing]], especially the style of my supervisor (which to me is scientific communication at its best) follows the same [[school of thought]]
        - What can we do differently in
the weeks, months or even years __before __we face
the blank page that will get us into the best
possible position to write a great paper easily?
            - Play the long game -- accumulate daily, [[be a collater/forager]] of information #keyquotes
        - We struggle because we're made to believe that writing begins with the blank page -- in which case you might well have reason to panic with such a daunting task
            - Having it all in your head ➝ forming the connections ([[storyline]]!! of the thoughts -- how do they make sense relative to, and in the context of one another?)
            - "Getting something that is already written into
another written piece is incomparably easier than
assembling everything in your mind and then
trying to retrieve it from there"
            - ^^The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic^^ #[[keyquotes]]
        - not IQ that defines academics/workers in any role really: ^^how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand^^ #keyquotes 
            - willpower is a limited resource, depletes quickly, doesn't really improve
            - And nobody needs willpower to do something
they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is
interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be
done, because there is no conflict between long-
and short-term interests.
            - 
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - Focus on the ^^overarching [[workflow]]^^
            - redefine this workflow as __having a clear structure to work IN__, rather than a set of plans to follow
                - "How do you plan for insight, which, by definition, cannot be anticipated?"
                - the [[workflow]] should allow insight/new ideas to become the driving force to push thinking forward
                - rigid plans are threatened by the unexpected -- like new ideas, discoveries and insight that would require constant adapation & realignment
        - “I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. 
Whenever I am stuck,
^^I do something else^^.”
            - Good structure in your notes (as well as a well-established foundational pool of notes) should allow you to move seamlessly between tasks -- without threatening the whole
arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture
            - [[flow]], the state in which
you get so completely immersed in your work
that you lose track of time and can just keep on
going as the work becomes effortless
(Csikszentmihalyi, 1975) #[[keyquotes]]
        - [[reading]] widely is important. Initially you have **fewer ideas to work with** as you realise that others have already thought of most things
This is the [[foundation]] being built
            - as you move onto ideas at the fringe of a given field, and also apply inter-disciplinary information, you now must deal with heterogeneous ideas that ^^don't come with clear [[storyline]]^^ of how they fit together
        - [[Dunning-Kruger effect]] - lack of insight into one's shortfalls
            - Valley of despair!
        - Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as
they focus on what they haven’t learned and mastered yet. This is why high
achievers ^^who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there^^ are
likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that
you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are (Clance and
Imes 1978; Brems __et al. __1994).. #keyquotes
            - "Valley of despair!"
            - Me in a nutshell lol
        - The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things ([[workflow]]) as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. 
^^The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level^^. 
            - Follow a routine (with [[structure]]) for note collating: Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly
            - [[structure]] is important because most distractions do not come so
much from our environment, but our own minds
            - We usually start with vague ideas that gain clarity as research/[[reading]] continues
        - Writing is not a linear process. We constantly have to jump back and forth
between different tasks
            - this is why the [[structure]] really needs to be simple -- to leave room for the fluidity of the writing process.

            - It's easy to feel like very little progress has been made after a gruelling writing session, where all I managed to do was clarify/confirm some ideas in the literature.
        - Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent.
            - oh god this feels like it could quickly become a downwards spiral for the OCD/OCD-inclined...
            - Just takes constant grooming/attention?
            - ### Make every entry into your notes-database count. Do it right the first time
    - [[Niklas Luhmann]] and his Slip-box
        - notes are not categorised by the topic or the text it came from
        - His slip-box became his ^^dialogue partner, main idea generator and productivity engine^^
            - it allowed him to complete a PhD, habilitation thesis (book written after PhD, apparently a European thing) in ONE year while taking sociology classes
        - notes are made valuable by its [[context]], which is not necessarily the context from which it was taken
            - [[Scientific writing]] and academic papers each have a [[storyline]] of their own to explain/make sense of their own data
                - Need to view each note gathered (collected because of its perceived value/new ideas) __in isolation__ to find new/other/multiple contexts into which the note fits
