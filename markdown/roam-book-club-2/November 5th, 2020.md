- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"When do you plan to read? Where? How often?"
{{[[POMO]]: 25}}
    1. [[Antonette Laderas]] I plan on reading after my daily morning quiet time, in my bed perhaps, daily. My ideal goal is to consume 15% of a book every single day to be able to read 1 book a week.
    2. [[Siva Arunagiri]] I plan on reading during my day in short intervals at work. I am just about 25% through the book. Using [[Readwise]] to transfer the [[Kindle-Highlights]] to my graph. 
    3. [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] As a student I'm always reading, but I'm planning on trying to schedule my reading a bit more during the day so i make sure that when i do the reading i have the energy to properly read it, take notes, and truly think about the ideas im taking in, rather than just moving my way through the book at a rapid pace and seeing what i gleam of it at the end. 
    4. [[Dan Allosso]] #alwaysreading but yeah, I should be more intentional about when I process the stuff I'm reading, listening to, watching. So far, it has been an evening activity once "work" reading and writing are done. I'm currently finishing a semester in which I'm teaching four classes, so prep and assessment keep me pretty busy. 
    5. [[Matthew Vogel]] I do my best intentional reading before noon. Reading for pleasure is usually best after 7 with a drink or some hot tea. I have been toying with the idea of trying to read more continuously throughout the day using the pomodoro method.
    6. [[Casey Gollan]] Fridays!
    7. [[Alex Shchedrin]] I do not have a planned time to read other than a few pages before going to sleep, majority of my reading this week happens ad hoc. I have mostly read the book before the Book club started, but now re-reading it from the graph while making fleeting notes on my page. The challenge is trying not to read all of the block references that are already there, because it slows me down significantly. 
        - Update. Ended up going on a long walk and allowing Alexa‚Äôs calming voice to narrate the book to me. 
        - Hint: If you have a Kindle version of the book you can use Amazon Alexa app to read it to you with Text to Speech.
- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]] [Deliberate practice is the only serious way of becoming better at what we are doing. If you change your mind about the importance of writing, you will also change your mind about everything else. Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing.](((9LdD6VzxA)))
    1. [[Beau Haan üìå]] {{[[POMO]]: 10}}
        - My heart is open to this idea of being deliberate in our practice. I see so many people feeling this frustration of being "hurt" or "burned" by other tools and techniques, and yet I am beholden to this idea that the emergence of this technology within [[Roam]] and the convergence with [[Zettelkasten]] is something truly powerful.
            - #Reply-from [[Calvin Robert Lee]] It truly is powerful! It's great to be a part of a small, but powerful movement towards intellectual rebirth.  Our tools have limited us in this domain for quite some time.  But, we are quite literally at the forefront of this experiment.  I'm most excited to see how a tool such as [[Roam]] combines with something such as Brain Computer Interfaces or [[GPT-3]]
        - So much so that I'm willing to put in this time to be of assistance and to serve wherever I can. It's really something that's truly blowing my mind.
        - I'm thinking about my conversations with so many people in this #roamcult and how with each conversation, they are literally taking the words out of my mouth.
        - When was the last time that happened, let alone, multiple times, with nearly every person part of this community!
        - I think it's the changing of one's mind that proves to be the hardest hurdle to overcome, yet I'm not deterred by it. The best and most exciting innovations have also come form overcoming the most difficult obstacles. 
        - When I think about it longer, the more I see just how I show up with my writing--influences how I show up in life.
        - Creating this habit has made me stretch into parts of my past that I have left dormant for so long. I mean, I am a grown-ass man, but to see the layers of what lies underneath makes me tremble, yet the terror wears off and dissipates like dew under the morning sun.
        - When he talks about a "single line" being able to improve the most profound parts of my existence... I stand in awe of that...
    2. [[Alex Shchedrin]] {{[[POMO]]: 10}}
        - I keep coming across the concept of deliberate practice: from [[How to Take Smart Notes]] to [[Ultralearning]], to the idea of "touching the keys" in piano practice. (That one refers to at the very least touching piano keys daily, even if you do not practice.)
        - I am also intrigued by the concept of [Programmable attention](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z3ngvUaW5C91hN6gXHqLwFMQ9kD7MNbmtYLyq), which I started incorporating into my own workflow with Roam's delta function. 
        - What if the deliberate practice is just reading your past writing for 5 minutes and then writing for 5 more? It is just 10 minutes per day. Though this may be enough to produce a few hundred notes each year. 
        - How does one create a positive feedback loop to continue this practice and set themselves up for success? 
            - Well, if you can make the task [‚Äúinteresting, meaningful and well-defined‚Äù](((tIetkYe5Q))), this challenge may take care of itself, right?
            - In addition to that, it is important to make time and space for for the practice. 
                - Is it the first thing you do in the morning? 
                    - #Reply-from [[Calvin Robert Lee]] It takes experimenting to figure out what time works best for your schedule.  It was a lot easier for me to get into this habit when I did it after returning from my morning walks, as my blood was flowing and my mind was active.
                - Do you only give yourself just 5 or 10 minutes to work on that? Or more?
                    - #Reply-from [[Calvin Robert Lee]] I spend 20 minutes on a predetermined PKM task.  It could range from transferring highlights to transcribing highlights from a book into my own words.  I have been doing this pretty consistently for a year and found that it was best to not overthink the importance of any one particular thought.  In other words, just casually do it a bit a day and the habit will be a lot easier to maintain, I struggled to enjoy this process when I felt that I had to "do well".
                - How do you know when to stop?
                    - Related to that, I saw a video last week, which helped me look differently on my exercise approach. Here it is ‚Äî an excerpt from a Joe Rogan show with Firas Zahabi. With deliberate practice one should not overdo it.

    3. [[Matt McKinlay]] {{[[POMO]]: 8}}
        - Deliberate practice is something I think about a lot. I read [[Anders Ericsson]]'s book two years ago on the topic, and it made me reconsider a lot of my training methods.  
        - I particularly think about the example in his book of London Taxi Drivers who had enlarged parts of their brain related to memory (hippocampus) as a result of having to recall and navigate London. Having to make complex choices of routes in real time every day, increased their memory. The study also compared London Bus Drivers who take the same route every day, and who didn't have increased memory. 
            - Conclusion- Completing complex cognitive tasks is important to improvement, rathe than repetitions of easy tasks.
                - I now try and use this- if identify something that I would like to get better at, I try and put myself in an environment which expects me to master a complex skill in order to survive in that environment.  
                    - It means my brain has a reason to engage in the difficulty, rather than just cruising on repetitions of easy work. 
                    - Equally, I try and __limit__ the amount of easy repetitions i am doing on any given task.

- #tips-and-tricks There is actually a native #Readwise way of capturing chapter titles in-line while reading. Take a look at their blogpost, [How to Add Chapters to Your Highlights in Readwise](https://blog.readwise.io/add-chapters-to-highlights/).
    - __"Simply highlight the title of each section and add a note beginning with a period (.) followed by an¬†h¬†(for "heading") and then the number¬†1¬†through¬†3¬†representing the section's position in the hierarchy."__
    - So when reading the first section of [[How to Take Smart Notes]] your highlights of the chapter/section titles would look like this..
        - `.h1` [[Introduction]]
            - `.h2` [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
                - `.h3` [[1.1 Good Solutions are Simple ‚Äì and Unexpected]]
                - `.h3` [[1.2 The Slip-box]]
                - `.h3` [[1.3 The slip-box manual]]
    - Any textual highlight you make will then be placed in the correct semantic location within readwise

- #Chat [[Siva Arunagiri]] Is there a way to disallow tags from being exported from [[Readwise]], when exporting [[Kindle-Highlights]]. 
    - #Reply [[Matthew Vogel]] I do not believe #Readwise has added templating for the actual highlights yet.
- #Chat [[Siva Arunagiri]] How do you all export your [[Audible]] bookmarks and highlight snippets?

    - #Chat [[Antonette Laderas]] I hope I can also watch the past [[Book Club LIve Session]]. It's meeting time here in the Philippines is 4 AM. Can't join huhu.
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I'll be hosting a meeting at 4PM (Manila-time) too!
            - #Reply [[Antonette Laderas]] Thanks for this! Already signed up in the said meeting. So excited! <3
- #Chat [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]] How do people feel about starting a [[Glossary]] of terms for the book club? 
    - #Chat [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]] A [[Glossary]] could help us to discuss terms, develop a common understanding of terms, and contrary to that identify how our understanding can differ.
        - #Reply [[Kate Foy üå±]] A common understanding of terms is very useful - critical, I'd say - in any multiplayer experience. I'm up for this. "One of the first things I learned as an undergrad was that defining my terms at the outset when writing essays was not a bad thing for writer and reader; it's a lesson which has stood me in good stead since. I'm finding the terminology associated with "smart-note" taking to be increasingly confusing the more popular it becomes (check out the "digital gardeners" out there üå±). Whilst I believe there should be space to create one's own - perhaps eccentric - methodology of note-taking (stepping in Luhmann's shoes) there are good reasons (consistency/understanding etc.) as we examine the book to come to an appreciation of how [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] uses the terminology. Terms that I'd like to pin down for clarity of thought: "fleeting" cf. "highlights'; "literature notes" cf. "seedlings"; "permanent notes"/"Evergreens" cf. "zettels" etc. There are others too, but these are the ones I'm bumping on. Sidebar: the parallel with the natural world (a la [[Steven Johnson]]) continues. Cheers! "
            - #Reply [[Brandon Toner]] [[@[[Lars Sch√∂bitz]]]]

cc: [[@[[Kate Foy üå±]]]], [[@Matthew McKinlay]], [[~[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]], [[@[[Beau Haan üìå]]]] 

Check out the [[Glossary]] page now, and check out each of the meta pages. This is where I'd love to see discussion about interpretation of the terms accumulate. So that we can start to generate a shared understanding, and engage in clarification discussions. A shared vocabulary is important. 
                - thanks! Yes, I went ahead and "starred" it
        - #Chat [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]] By using a common template with [[attributes]] we can create a complete overview.
            - #Chat [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]] I am using [[attributes]] for the first time and want to learn more about useful implementations. Can I export attribute tables as JSON or CSV fil
        - 
    - #Reply from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] to "#Chat [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]] A [[Glossary]] could help us to discuss terms, develop a common understanding of terms, and contrary to that identify how our understanding can differ."
        - I love it! let's talk about it more this weekend
            - #Reply-from [[Lars Sch√∂bitz]] Unfortunately, I won't be able to join for the [[Live Session 2]] tonight. Wishing you all great fun!
- #Chat [[Matthew Vogel]] General question: Is there someone or some role that will be cleaning up overlapping pages/tags? For example we have [[fleeting notes]] [[Fleeting Notes]] and [[- Fleeting notes]]. Maybe trying to organize the chaos too much is a Sisyphean task :P 
    - #Reply-from[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] yeah that's important. We have to just set a convention for lower case or upper case. 
        - probably by using a slider-poll and letting the majority pick it. 
        - one idea - use the CSS as a kind of "invitational forcing function"
        - notice that custom CSS shows up if and only if you use the exact version, e.g.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] gets the CSS treatment, but other versions don't
        - in that sense we can make clear the group conventions through the CSS
        - if people __REALLY__ want to do their own thing, they can - their notes just might not be visible to others, so the incentive just becomes - "if I can adopt this convention, even just here, in this database - which I can just change back to my own when I copy back to my own database - the advantage is others will be able to see and build upon my work."
    - #Reply-from [[Matthew Vogel]] I like your[ CSS treatment idea](((YGjUS8ybL))) could get tricky with emerging tags but you're right the group consensus about case will be key 
        - #Reply-from[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] this is a total aside but wanted to add
            -  I'd never seen someone reply with a reference to another block within an alias the way you did in that line right above - 
            - that's a nice [convention](#Conventions) that lets us essentially "quote tweet" other blocks while at the same time adapting them into our own language, thanks for showing me that - I had not seen it used that way before!
            - #Reply-from [[Matthew Vogel]] I love doing that and as a bonus with the new way block references work you can 'open' up a the quote tweet 'conversation' under the [original block](((A6zuN_dqT))). 
                - be careful with with you ref though [convention with double brackets]([[conventions]]) works but [convention with a bare #](#conventions) does not
- #Chat[[Mika Mauger]]
    - Made a #quote css, hope you like how it looks.
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] cool! thanks!
    - #Reply-from [[Matthew Vogel]] This is nice! What do people think about migrating this and some of the other custom tag CSS to include attributes?
        - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] writes - [[@[[Matthew Vogel]]]], can you explain more about what you mean by that?
        - [[Matthew Vogel]] writes - [[~[[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]]] Looks like I spoke out of turn. I was sure that attributes had a CSS `data-tag` similar to tags.  In my personal graph I use attributes on my page for things like quote:: and Fleeting Notes:: Maybe I should switch to using tags for multiplayer
            - I also feel like I'm using `attributes` incorrectly...
            - Sidenote: what's the [[@]] convention? Do we change it once we have responded to the question?
                - Actually looking back at [Tuesday's conversation](((7xXOCqUeJ))) it seems like this is still in flux
