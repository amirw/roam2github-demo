    - [[Introduction]]
        - "Everybody writes. Especially in academia. Students write and professors write. And nonfiction writers, who are the third group of people this book is aiming to help, obviously write as well. And writing doesn’t necessarily mean papers, articles or books, but everyday, basic writing. We write when we need to remember something, be it an idea, a quote or the outcome of a study. We write when we want to organise our thoughts and when we want to exchange ideas with others. Students write when they take an exam, but the first thing they do to prepare even for an oral examination is to grab pen and paper. We write down not only those things we fear we won’t remember otherwise, but also the very things we try to memorise. Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note."
            - That last line is a powerful assertion, and I can't disagree with it! #[[Fleeting Notes]]

- "Graph Meditation #[[Graph Meditation]]"
    - As I look through the Graph the references are a great way to see if my Fleeting Notes agree with others. They usually don't, instead they have insights that did not occur to me.
- Literature Notes::
- We have the best chance to change our behaviour over the long term if we start with a realistic idea about the difficulties of behavioural change... [*](((x5hx3y9ay)))
    - Behavioral change may conflict with pre-existing habits. These habits give us a false sense of control, that may be mere familiarity. See: ""mere-exposure effect: doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it–completely independent of our actual performance(Bornstein 1989). We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill.""

            - Between Fleeting Notes, Literature Notes, and Zettels -- are there times when you take shortcuts? Do you always do all three, or do you skip Fleeting Notes and jump to Literature or Zettels?
        - "General review questions "
            - I love how the book started out: very encouraging, not overwhelming, not "everything you've been doing is wrong." Instead, you had the reader just "start now" and not go back and remap every note they've taken in the past.

            3. Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten
            4. (what use cases does it work for? Are there any examples it doesn't work for?)
        - General review questions 
            1. Reflect on your impressions of the book 
            2. Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?

- "[[Live Session 7]] Starting 12:30 PST"
- "You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say? "
- It's a way of note-taking where you've created a permanent type of note that is well considered: a summary/evaluation/agreement/disagreement with what your read -- a conversation with yourself -- recorded in a way that your "future self" can retrieve it, understand it, and integrate it into other ideas.
- "Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?"
- "The book promotes a bottom up approach to note taking, which we have used in Book Club. Reflect on this. How did this feel? "
- Prevents "confirmation bias" 
- "What's your favourite blocks (or quotes) from the book?"
