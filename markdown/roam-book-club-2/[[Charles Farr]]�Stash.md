- "There is something spiritual about thinking together with another human being. It can happen in conversation (when there is listening). With Roam I get a glimmer of the #[[Big Mind]] that zen masters talk about. Seeing that thought arises in the Universe as opposed to "me" sitting here and deciding what to say."
- "Some [[[[Metacognition]] [[questions]]]]:"
    - "This idea reminds me of..."
    - "This point conflicts with..."
    - "I don't really understand how..."
    - "What questions should I be asking?"
    - "How should I summarize this?"
    - "What does it feel like to understand something?"
    - "Where are my blind spots?"
    - "What is my emotional connection to this content?"
- "How do we develop collective lines of thought in Book Club?  How do we navigate the zettel concept if we don't have a collective line of inquiry? "
- "Line of inquiry- Do we need centrally set lines of inquiry? Or let them form from bottom up? Are there constraints? "
- "My Zettelkasten Workflow:: #Highlight #zettelkasten #Summary"
- **On Literature Notes**
    - "With a second read, I finally "get" Literature Notes, and now that I do I find that taking notes takes on a new meaning and significance. Reframing everything in your own words forces a more active learning and understanding of the material which makes the jump to permanent note easier."
    - "Literature notes helped me realize that I have been highlight far too much of the books I read. Although I do think the process of reviewing my highlights, generating literature notes, and then getting rid of the extraneous highlights has helped me through a spaced repetition practice. Next up, is getting more confident inking my keyword and blocks in order to start generating useful atomic thoughts for writing."
