- Fleeting Notes:: 
- Primary Highlights Throughout the Book
    - the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development. This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But most of all, you can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward.

    - Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work. And maybe that is the reason why we rarely think about this writing, the everyday writing, the note-taking and draft-making. Like breathing, it is vital to what we do, but because we do it constantly, it escapes our attention.
        - **Highlight**  location: 82
    - There is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly.
        - **Highlight**  location: 87
    - What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily?
        - **Highlight**  location: 96
    - good, productive writing is based on good note-taking. Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there.
        - **Highlight**  location: 103
    - The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.
        - **Highlight**  location: 105
    - What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand
        - **Highlight**  location: 112
    - Doing the work required and doing it in a smart way leads, somehow unsurprisingly, to success.
        - **Highlight**  location: 115
    - Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long-and short-term interests. Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play.
        - **Highlight**  location: 123
    - If you can trust the system, you can let go of the attempt to hold everything together in your head and you can start focusing on what is important: The content, the argument and the ideas.
        - **Highlight**  location: 133
    - By breaking down the amorphous task of“writing a paper” into small and clearly separated tasks, you can focus on one thing at a time, complete each in one go and move on to the next one
        - **Highlight**  location: 135
    - Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible. To keep going according to plan, you have to push yourself and employ willpower. This is not only demotivating, but also unsuitable for an open-ended process like research, thinking or studying in general, where we have to adjust our next steps with every new insight, understanding or achievement–which we ideally have on a regular basis and not just as an exception.
        - **Highlight**  location: 142
    - It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around.
        - **Highlight**  location: 147
    - those who are not very good at something tend to be overly confident, while those who have made an effort tend to underestimate their abilities.
        - **Highlight**  location: 169
    - Even the best tool will not improve your productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines the tool is embedded in, just as the fastest car won’t help you much if you don’t have proper roads to drive it on. Like every change in behaviour, a change in working habits means going through a phase where you are drawn back to your old ways. The new way of working might feel artificial at first and not necessarily like what you intuitively would do.
        - **Highlight**  location: 198
    - Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly
        - **Highlight**  location: 202
    - Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place(which is why none of the typical“10 mind-blowing tools to improve your productivity” tips you can find all over the internet will ever be of much help).
        - **Highlight**  location: 203
    - The principle is simple but holistic. It is not a quick fix or a fancy tool. It doesn’t do the work for you. But it does provide a structure for our everyday work that deals with the fact that most distractions do not come so much from our environment, but our own minds.
        - **Highlight**  location: 212
    - Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand.

    - “If I want something, it’s more time. The only thing that really is a nuisance is the lack of time.”

    - only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.”
        - **Highlight**  location: 287
    - Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned–which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work.
        - **Highlight**  location: 298
    - Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place
        - **Highlight**  location: 302
    - Instead of struggling with adverse dynamics, highly productive people deflect resistance, very much like judo champions.
        - **Highlight**  location: 304
    - Sure, you need to be smart to be successful in academia and writing, but if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just can’t be compensated by a high IQ.

    - The contemporaries of Henry Ford did not understand why something as simple as the conveyor belt should be that revolutionary.

    - Writing these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it. All you have to do is to have a pen in your hand while you are doing what you are doing anyway(or a keyboard under your fingers).
        - **Highlight**  location: 394
    - Writing notes accompanies the main work and, done right, it helps with it. Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have. Notes build up while you think, read, understand and generate ideas, because you have to have a pen in your hand if you want to think, read, understand and generate ideas properly anyway. If you want to learn something for the long run, you have to write it down. If you want to really understand something, you have to translate it into your own words.
        - **Highlight**  location: 396
    - Make fleeting notes. Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind. Don’t worry too much about how you write it down or what you write it on. These are fleeting notes, mere reminders of what is in your head.
        - **Highlight**  location: 410
    - Make literature notes. Whenever you read something, make notes about the content. Write down what you don’t want to forget or think you might use in your own thinking or writing. Keep it very short, be extremely selective, and use your own words.
        - **Highlight**  location: 415
    - The idea is not to collect, but to develop ideas, arguments and discussions.
        - **Highlight**  location: 421
    - Does the new information contradict, correct, support or add to what you already have(in the slip-box or on your mind)? Can you combine ideas to generate something new? What questions are triggered by them?
        - **Highlight**  location: 422
    - Write exactly one note for each idea and write as if you were writing for someone else: Use full sentences, disclose your sources, make references and try to be as precise, clear and brief as possible.
        - **Highlight**  location: 423
    - Build upon what you have. Even if you don’t have anything in your slip-box yet, you never start from scratch–you already have ideas on your mind to be tested, opinions to be challenged and questions to be answered. Do not brainstorm for a topic. Look into the slip-box instead to see where chains of notes have developed and ideas have been built up to clusters.
        - **Highlight**  location: 436
    - Spending the little extra time to add them to your system will make all the difference, because the accidental encounters make up the majority of what we learn.
        - **Highlight**  location: 467
    - An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read.
        - **Highlight**  location: 567
    - the professor is not there for the student and the student not for the professor. Both are only there for the truth. And truth is always a public matter.
        - **Highlight**  location: 572
    - Having a clear, tangible purpose when you attend a lecture, discussion or seminar will make you more engaged and sharpen your focus. You will not waste your time with the attempt to figure out what you“should” learn.
        - **Highlight**  location: 589
    - You quickly learn to distinguish good-sounding arguments from actual good ones, as you will have to think them through whenever you try to write them down and connect them with your previous knowledge.
        - **Highlight**  location: 592
    - Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing.
        - **Highlight**  location: 599
    - is the simplicity of an idea that makes it so powerful
        - **Highlight**  location: 602
    - When McLean converted the tanker Ideal X to be able to carry 58 containers and set it to sail on 26 April 1956, it was just because it made more sense to ship parts of a lorry than the whole lorry itself, which in itself made more sense than to have them stand in traffic for days.
        - **Highlight**  location: 607
    - The idea was simple, but it wasn’t easy to put it efficiently into practice.
        - **Highlight**  location: 620
    - Only after aligning every single part of the delivery chain, from packaging to delivery, from the design of the ships to the design of the harbours, was the full potential of the container unleashed.
        - **Highlight**  location: 628
    - In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again? Most students sort their material by topic or even by seminars and semester. From the perspective of someone who writes, that makes as much sense as sorting your errands by purchase date and the store they were bought from. Can’t find your trousers? Maybe they are with the bleach you bought the same day at your department store.
        - **Highlight**  location: 641
    - You decide on what you are going to write about and then collect everything that helps you to do that. The disadvantage is that you have to start all over after each project and cut off all other promising lines of thought. That means that everything you found, thought or encountered during the time of a project will be
        - **Highlight**  location: 671
    - If you try to mitigate the effect by opening a new folder for every potential new project whenever you stumble upon something that might be interesting for that, you will soon end up with an overwhelming amount of unfinished projects. If that in itself does not become a drag on your motivation, the task of keeping track of them will.
        - **Highlight**  location: 674
    - without a permanent reservoir of ideas, you will not be able to develop any major ideas over a longer period of time because you are restricting yourself either to the length of a single project or the capacity of your memory. Exceptional ideas need much more than that.
        - **Highlight**  location: 676
    - What all these category-confusing approaches have in common is that the benefit of note-taking decreases with the number of notes you keep. More notes will make it more difficult to retrieve the right ones and bring related ones together in a playful way.
        - **Highlight**  location: 681
    - is important to understand, though, that underlining sentences or writing comments in the margins are also just fleeting notes and do nothing to elaborate on a text. They will very soon become completely useless–unless you do something with them.
        - **Highlight**  location: 689
    - Permanent notes, on the other hand, are written in a way that can still be understood even when you have forgotten the context they are taken from.
        - **Highlight**  location: 695
    - every permanent note for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece, but that can not be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments. The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference.

    - removing all unnecessary complications or decisions that come with a variety of different formats and storage places.
        - **Highlight**  location: 714
    - Only because every note is in the same format at the same place can they later be combined and assembled into something new and no thought is ever wasted on the question of where to put or label it.
        - **Highlight**  location: 715
    - I suggest keeping a physical binder for each project to keep all the handwritten notes and printouts separate from the rest and combined in one place.
        - **Highlight**  location: 731
    - Be it twelve steps, according to the Academic Skills & Learning Centre of the Australian National University, or eight, if you go with the recommendations of the Writing Center of the University of Wisconsin, the rough order is always the same: Make a decision on what to write about, plan your research, do your research, write. Interestingly enough, these road maps usually come with the concession that this is only an idealised plan and that in reality, it rarely works like that. This is certainly true. Writing can’t be that linear. The obvious question is: If that is true, why not root the course of action in reality instead?
        - **Highlight**  location: 743
    - the decision to read something and not something else is obviously rooted in prior understanding, and that didn’t come out of thin air, either. Every intellectual endeavour starts from an already existing preconception, which then can be transformed during further inquires and can serve as a starting point for following endeavours. Basically, that is what Hans-Georg Gadamer called the hermeneutic circle
        - **Highlight**  location: 750
    - We will not be guided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but by our interest, curiosity and intuition, which is formed and informed by the actual work of reading, thinking, discussing, writing and developing ideas–and is something that continuously grows and reflects our knowledge and understanding externally.
        - **Highlight**  location: 758
    - The advice to think about what to write about before you write comes both too early and too late. Too late, as you already have passed up the chance to build up written resources when you face the white sheet of paper or the blank screen, but also too early, if you try to postpone every serious content-related work until you have made a decision on the topic.
        - **Highlight**  location: 776
    - writing is not a linear process, but a circular one: the problem of finding a topic is replaced by the problem of having too many topics to write about.
        - **Highlight**  location: 781
    - How can you not have trouble finding a topic if you believe you have to decide on one before you have done your research, have read and learned about something?
        - **Highlight**  location: 787
    - How can you not feel threatened by an empty page if you have literally nothing at hand to fill it with? Who can blame you for procrastinating if you find yourself stuck with a topic you decided on blindly and now have to stick with it as the deadline is approaching?
        - **Highlight**  location: 788
    - if we feel constantly stuck in our work, we will become demotivated and much more likely to procrastinate, leaving us with fewer positive or even bad experiences like missed deadlines. We might end up in a vicious circle of failure
        - **Highlight**  location: 813
    - Any attempts to trick ourselves into work with external rewards(like doing something nice after finishing a chapter) are only short-term solutions with no prospect of establishing a positive feedback loop. These are very fragile motivational constructions. Only if the work itself becomes rewarding can the dynamic of motivation and reward become self-sustainable and propel the whole process forward

    - Embracing a growth mindset means to get pleasure out of changing for the better(which is mostly inwardly rewarding) instead of getting pleasure in being praised(which is outwardly rewarding).

    - the fear of failure has the ugliest name of all phobias: Kakorrhaphiophobia.
        - **Highlight**  location: 839
    - We tend to think we understand what we read–until we try to rewrite it in our own words.
        - **Highlight**  location: 850
    - Expressing our own thoughts in writing makes us realise if we really thought them through. The moment we try to combine them with previously written notes, the system will unambiguously show us contradictions, inconsistencies and repetitions.
        - **Highlight**  location: 859
    - if facts are not kept isolated nor learned in an isolated fashion, but hang together in a network of ideas, or“latticework of mental models”(Munger, 1994), it becomes easier to make sense of new information. That makes it easier not only to learn and remember, but also to retrieve the information later in the moment and context it is needed.
        - **Highlight**  location: 873
    - mere-exposure effect: doing something many times makes us believe we have become good at it–completely independent of our actual performance(Bornstein 1989). We unfortunately tend to confuse familiarity with skill.
        - **Highlight**  location: 913
    - Writing a paper involves much more than just typing on the keyboard. It also means reading, understanding, reflecting, getting ideas, making connections, distinguishing terms, finding the right words, structuring, organizing, editing, correcting and rewriting. All these are not just different tasks, but tasks requiring a different kind of attention. It is not only impossible to focus on more than one thing at a time, but also to have a different kind of attention on more than one thing at a time.
        - **Highlight**  location: 918
    - The good news is that we can train ourselves to stay focused on one thing for longer if we avoid multitasking, remove possible distractions and separate different kinds of tasks as much as possible so they will not interfere with each other. This too is not just a question of having the right mindset, but, equally important, of how we organise our workflow.
        - **Highlight**  location: 931
    - outlining not as the preparation of writing or even as planning, but as a separate task we need to return to throughout the writing process on a regular basis.

    - the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas.
        - **Highlight**  location: 977
    - But academic writing is an art, as well, which means it is something we can become better at with experience and deliberate practice.
        - **Highlight**  location: 1002
    - There can be no universally applicable rule about which step has to be taken when. Each new project is different, and at each stage of the project, it might be best to read up on something, to review a passage, to discuss an idea or to change the outline of the manuscript. There is no universal rule that could tell one upfront at which stage it wouldn’t make sense to follow up on an idea, a possible contradiction or a footnote.

    - Much to her surprise, the waiter she admired just minutes ago for his great memory didn’t even recognise her. Questioned about what seemed to her a contradiction, he explained that all the waiters had no problem remembering the orders and matching them with the guests at the table. But the very second diners left the restaurant, the waiters all forgot them completely and focused on the next group.
        - **Highlight**  location: 1071
    - Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory–until they are done. That is why we get so easily distracted by thoughts of unfinished tasks, regardless of their importance. But thanks to Zeigarnik’s follow-up research, we also know that we don’t actually have to finish tasks to convince our brains to stop thinking about them. All we have to do is to write them down in a way that convinces us that it will be taken care of.
        - **Highlight**  location: 1075
    - Acts of self-control, responsible decision making, and active choice seem to interfere with other such acts that follow soon after.
        - **Highlight**  location: 1111
    - By always using the same notebook for making quick notes, always extracting the main ideas from a text in the same way and always turning them into the same kind of permanent notes, which are always dealt with in the same manner, the number of decisions during a work session can be greatly reduced. That leaves us with much more mental energy that we can direct towards more useful tasks, like trying to solve the problems in question.
        - **Highlight**  location: 1127
    - To get a good paper written, you only have to rewrite a good draft; to get a good draft written, you only have to turn a series of notes into a continuous text. And as a series of notes is just the rearrangement of notes you already have in your slip-box, all you really have to do is have a pen in your hand when you read.
        - **Highlight**  location: 1141
    - the mere copying of quotes almost always changes their meaning by stripping them out of context, even though the words aren’t changed. This is a common beginner mistake, which can only lead to a patchwork of ideas, but never a coherent thought.
        - **Highlight**  location: 1160
    - Because students can’t write fast enough to keep up with everything that is said in a lecture, they are forced to focus on the gist of what is being said, not the details. But to be able to note down the gist of a lecture, you have to understand it in the first place. So if you are writing by hand, you are forced to think about what you hear(or read)–otherwise you wouldn’t be able to grasp the underlying principle, the idea, the structure of an argument.
        - **Highlight**  location: 1199
    - We look around and just cut out dis-confirming facts without even noticing what we don’t see, very much like the same city can one day be full of happy people and the other day full of miserable ones, depending on our mood.

    - As the psychologist Raymond Nickerson puts it:“If one were to attempt to identify a single problematic aspect of human reasoning that deserves attention above all others, the confirmation bias would have to be among the candidates for consideration”(Nickerson 1998,

    - “I had [...] during many years followed a golden rule, namely, that whenever a published fact, a new observation or thought came across me, which was opposed to my general results, to make a memorandum of it without fail and at once; for I had found by experience that such facts and thoughts were far more apt to escape from the memory than favorable ones. Owing to this habit, very few objections were raised against my views, which I had not at least noticed and attempted to answer.”(Darwin 1958, 123)
        - **Highlight**  location: 1225
    - Confirmation bias is tackled here in two steps: First, by turning the whole writing process on its head, and secondly, by changing the incentives from finding confirming facts to an indiscriminate gathering of any relevant information regardless of what argument it will support.
        - **Highlight**  location: 1232
    - First, you basically fix your present understanding, as the outcome instead of using it as the starting point, priming yourself for one-sided perception.

    - One of the most important habitual changes when starting to work with the slip-box is moving the attention from the individual project with our preconceived ideas towards the open connections within the slip-box.

    - Immanuel Kant described in his famous text about the Enlightenment:“Nonage [immaturity] is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s own mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know!(Sapere aude.) ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.”

    - Rewriting what was already written almost automatically trains one to shift the attention towards frames, patterns and categories in the observations, or the conditions/assumptions, which enable certain, but not other descriptions. It makes sense to always ask the question: What is not meant, what is excluded if a certain claim is made?
        - **Highlight**  location: 1291
    - Being able to re-frame questions, assertions and information is even more important than having an extensive knowledge, because without this ability, we wouldn’t be able to put our knowledge to use.

    - If we don’t try to verify our understanding during our studies, we will happily enjoy the feeling of getting smarter and more knowledgeable while in reality staying as dumb as we were.
        - **Highlight**  location: 1323
    - we are faced with a clear choice: We have to choose between feeling smarter or becoming smarter. And while writing down an idea feels like a detour, extra time spent, not writing it down is the real waste of time, as it renders most of what we read as ineffectual.

    - “The one who does the work does the learning,”
        - **Highlight**  location: 1348
    - To understand how groundbreaking this idea is, it helps to remember how much effort teachers still put into the attempt to make learning easier for their students by prearranging information, sorting it into modules, categories and themes. By doing that, they achieve the opposite of what they intend to do. They make it harder for the student to learn because they set everything up for reviewing, taking away the opportunity to build meaningful connections and to make sense of something by translating it into one’s own language. It is like fast food: It is neither nutritious nor very enjoyable, it is just convenient.

    - “Manipulations such as variation, spacing, introducing contextual interference, and using tests, rather than presentations, as learning events, all share the property that they appear during the learning process to impede learning, but they then often enhance learning as measured by post-training tests of retention and transfer. Conversely, manipulations such as keeping conditions constant and predictable and massing trials on a given task often appear to enhance the rate of learning during instruction or training, but then typically fail to support long-term retention and transfer”

    - The slip-box takes care of details and references and is a long-term memory resource that keeps information objectively unaltered. That allows the brain to focus on the gist, the deeper understanding and the bigger picture, and frees it up to be creative. Both the brain and the slip-box can focus on what they are best at.

    - But the first question I asked myself when it came to writing the first permanent note for the slip-box was: What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just another way of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest?

    - the example of a biology novice who learns the difference between veins and arteries:“[he] may find it difficult at first to understand and remember that arteries have thick walls, are elastic, and do not have valves, whereas veins are less elastic, have thinner walls, and have valves”(ibid.). But by elaborating a little bit on this difference and asking the right questions, like“why?” the students can connect this knowledge with prior knowledge, like their understanding of pressure and the function of the heart. Just by making the connection to the common knowledge that the heart presses the blood into the arteries, they immediately know that these walls need to sustain more pressure, which means they need to be thicker than veins, in which the blood flows back to the heart with less pressure. And, of course, this makes valves necessary to keep the blood from flowing back.

    - the feature-positive effect(Allison and Messick 1988; Newman, Wolff, and Hearst 1980; Sainsbury 1971). This is the phenomenon in which we tend to overstate the importance of information that is(mentally) easily available to us and tilts our thinking towards the most recently acquired facts, not necessarily the most relevant ones. Without external help, we would not only take exclusively into account what we know, but what is on top
        - **Highlight**  location: 1805
    - This stands in harsh contrast to the common but not-so-wise belief that we need to learn from experience. It is much better to learn from the experiences of others–especially when this experience is reflected on and turned into versatile“mental models” that can be used in different situations.
        - **Highlight**  location: 1835
    - If we practice learning not as a pure accumulation of knowledge, but as an attempt to build up a latticework of theories and mental models to which information can stick, we enter a virtuous circle where learning facilitates learning.

    - We learn something not only when we connect it to prior knowledge and try to understand its broader implications(elaboration), but also when we try to retrieve it at different times(spacing) in different contexts(variation), ideally with the help of chance(contextual interference) and with a deliberate effort(retrieval).

    - Abstraction does not have a good reputation at the moment. It is the tangible, the concrete that is cheered for. Abstraction should indeed not be the final goal of thinking, but it is a necessary in-between step to make heterogeneous ideas compatible. If Darwin had never abstracted from his concrete observations of sparrows, he would never have found an abstract, a general principle of evolution across different species, and he would never have been able to see how evolution works in other species as well. Abstraction is also not for theoretical-academic processes of insight only. We need to abstract from concrete situations every day. Only by abstraction and re-specification can we apply ideas in the singular and always different situations in reality(Loewenstein, 2010).

    - the ability to truly see what is in front of one’s eyes is often listed as a trait of experts. And that is easily explained by the fact that our perception does not follow the order of seeing first and interpreting second. It does both at the same time: We always perceive something as something–our interpretation is instantaneous.

    - To be able to see what we see instead of what we expect to see is indeed a skill in itself, not like a character trait of being“open-minded.” Those who think of themselves as being open-minded are often even more prone to stick to their first understanding as they believe to be without natural prejudices and therefore don’t see the need to counterbalance them.

During World War II, he was asked to help the Royal Air Force find the areas on their planes that were most often hit by bullets so they could cover them with more armour. But instead of counting the bullet holes on the returned planes, he recommended armouring the spots where none of the planes had taken any hits. The RAF forgot to take into account what was not there to see: All the planes that didn’t make it back.

    - We check if what we understood from a text is really in the text by having our understanding in written form in front of our eyes. We learn to focus on the gist of an idea by restricting ourselves in terms of space. We can make it a habit to always think about what is missing when we write down our own ideas. And we can practice asking good questions when we sort our notes into the slip-box and connect them with other notes.

    - We are restricted to the use of only 26 letters, but what that enables us to do! We can write novels, theories, love letters or court orders–just by rearranging these 26 letters. This is certainly not possible despite the restriction to 26 letters, but because of it. Nobody will open a book and wish it contains more types of letters or be disappointed because it is, again, just another variation of the same alphabet.[36]

    - Since writing is nothing more than the revision of a rough draft, which is nothing more than turning a series of notes into a continuous text, which are written on a day-to-day basis, connected and indexed in the slip-box, there is no need to worry about finding a topic to write about. Just look into your slip-box and see where clusters have been built up. These clusters are what caught your interest again

    - the brain prioritises ideas that are easily available in the moment. This, obviously, does not equal relevant. The brain more easily remembers information that it encountered recently, which has emotions attached to it and is lively, concrete or specific. Ideally, it rhymes as well(cf. Schacter, 2001; Schacter, Chiao and Mitchell, 2003). Everything that is rather abstract, vague, emotionally neutral or does not even sound good is far down on its list of priorities–not exactly the best criteria for an intellectual endeavour.

    - Good questions are in the sweet spot of being relevant and interesting, not too easy to answer but possible to tackle with material that is available or at least within our reach. When it comes to finding good questions, it is therefore not enough to think about it. We have to do something with an idea before we know enough about it to make a good judgement. We have to work, write, connect, differentiate, complement and elaborate on questions–but this is what we do when we take smart notes.

    - The slip-box is in some way what the chemical industry calls“verbund.” This is a setup in which the inevitable by-product of one production line becomes the resource for another, which again produces by-products that can be used in other processes and so on, until a network of production lines becomes so efficiently intertwined that there is no chance of an isolated factory competing with it anymore.[40]

    - If we read something that is interesting, but not directly relevant to our current project, we can still use it for another project we are working on or might work on. Everything that enriches our slip-box has the potential to end up in a text we might write. By taking smart notes, we collect en passant the material for our future writings in one place. The projects we work on can be in completely different stages of completion. Some of them might not even have come to our attention.

Getting hundreds of these cases of feedback over the course of a year will make us much more likely to learn from them and to become more realistic about our productivity than if we just miss a deadline once in a while, which, of course, will not happen again–until next time.

    - According to the famous law of Parkinson, every kind of work tends to fill the time we set aside for it, like air fills every corner of a room(Parkinson 1957). While this is almost a universal law for longer time frames, the opposite is true for tasks that can be completed in one go. This is partly due to the aforementioned Zeigarnik effect(Zeigarnik 1927), in which our brains tend to stay occupied with a task until it is accomplished(or written down). If we have the finish line in sight, we tend to speed up, as everyone knows who has ever run a marathon. That means that the most important step is to get started. Rituals help, too(Currey 2013).
