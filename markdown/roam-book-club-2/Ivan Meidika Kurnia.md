        - I encountered the concept of [[Fleeting Notes]] through [[GTD]], it kinda works the same way with 'Inbox' to capture every idea that pops. I resonate with what [[Sönke Ahrens]] wrote: they should not cause any distraction. If I may add one line, it would be this:
            - ^^It should be frictionless to write in fleeting notes.^^
        - [[Literature Notes]]
            - Short, extremely selective, and keep these notes together with the bibliographic details in one place.
                - #[[Questions for Sönke]]: Do you think #Tags in our digital note-taking tools, such as [[Roam Research]], already fulfilled those criteria? If yes, why? If no, what can Roam do to improve?
        - [[Permanent Notes]]

        - Tools
            - Inbox Notes which I already have and do.
            - Reference Management System - I think Roam works as both reference management system and slip-box?
