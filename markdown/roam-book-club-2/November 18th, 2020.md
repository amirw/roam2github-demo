- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"How often do you feel overwhelmed by the process of creating your own [[Zettelkasten]]? What exactly are the sticking points that continue to resurface? How can you breakthrough those issues with a clearly drawn out plan? What are the steps you would show others to take, who deal with similar problems?"
    1. #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] while I’m glad to be held accountable, reading the book **and** literally “rewriting” the way in which I take notes (and flip my thinking from top-down to bottom-up) in the matter of just 2 weeks is quite an undertaking for some. If I had to give a tip, be mindful of Sonke’s words while taking notes on 2 fronts: (1) the purpose of why you are reading the book and (2) the “dialogue” in your slipbox - it can help filter out the random noise from what is relevant (and thus potentially creating fewer fleeting notes to review).
        - #Reply-from[[Yingyue Liu]]Wow! Thank you for your suggestions! Besides, I really like your personal page here! And your digital greenhouse is great!

    3. #Reply-from[[Yingyue Liu]]When I have too many fleeting notes after finished reading a book but I at the same time have other commitments. The sense of scarcity of time stresses me out to take the time and thoughts developing a mature Zettelkasten. 
        - Whenever this happened, I usually lower my standard and digitalize the fleeting notes first. The process of transcribing handwritten notes into Roam Research is very therapeutic. 
        - I actually don't really plan. I assign myself a major task each day and work on it one [[Pomodoro]] after another until I feel I need to take a long break. 
        - One note at a time and one Pomodoro after another. That's the mantra keeps me moving sustainably.
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] I totally agree. breaking down the process into “one note at a time” knowing there is an end is almost like swimming laps where all there is to do is put one arm in front of the other and remember to breathe. 🏊‍♂️ it’s a really helpful reminder!
                - "But the biggest difference lies in the task you are facing to start with. It is much easier to get started if the next step is as feasible as “writing a note,” “collect what is interesting in this paper” or “turning this series of notes into a paragraph” than if we decide to spend the next days with a vague and ill-defined task like “keep working on that overdue paper.”"
