- [[Questions for SÃ¶nke]]
    - Could it be said that Roam can subsume the Zettlekasten method and expand on it, possibly, or is it necessary to follow the Zettlekasten method exactly? For example, are naming conventions of zettles still very important in a graph system like this.

        - I don' really have any special goals here other than to simply learn some practical ways to use Roam within a powerful framework such as Zettlekasten.
