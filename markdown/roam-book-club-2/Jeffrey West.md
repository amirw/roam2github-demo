- Fleeting Notes::
    - Maybe it's less important to take great notes, but to put into practice. Rather than writing another paper, change what you are doing.
    - Granularity at the block level. But you can link it to the previous block. Distinguish between different types of links between blocks/zettles.
    - One hashtag only: index only.
- 
- You can replace a block with text & an alias, so it links back to the original with an astrisk.
- Example:
    - This note is presumably related to the first, but I've changed the text inside and left the reference. [*](((QSFWeWPx5)))
    - This note is presumably related to the SECOND. [*](((P6k9fm3eG)))
