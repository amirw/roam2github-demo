- Hello world!
    - Lion and the Mouse Fable
        - A Lion lay asleep in the forest, his great head resting on his paws. A timid little Mouse came upon him unexpectedly, and in her fright and haste to get away, ran across the Lion's nose. Roused from his nap, the Lion laid his huge paw angrily on the tiny creature to kill her.
        - "Spare me!" begged the poor Mouse. "Please let me go and some day I will surely repay you."
        - The Lion was much amused to think that a Mouse could ever help him. But he was generous and finally let the Mouse go.
        - Some days later, while stalking his prey in the forest, the Lion was caught in the toils of a hunter's net. Unable to free himself, he filled the forest with his angry roaring. The Mouse knew the voice and quickly found the Lion struggling in the net. Running to one of the great ropes that bound him, she gnawed it until it parted, and soon the Lion was free.
        - "You laughed when I said I would repay you," said the Mouse. "Now you see that even a Mouse can help a Lion."

        - There are times when circumstances demand humility from those in positions of strength. One of the aesop's fable illustrates this when the Lion has to ask for help from a mouse to free him from a hunter's cage.
        - To me it's that circumanstacnes are never permanent and being open to allowing for people who are less advantaged--more opportunites
        - Why?
            - If you assume
            - Stereotyping in a team
            - The person with the largest grades doesn't always perform better
            - The idea might come from the others
            - You can't assume by appearances alone
            - I was never denied opportunity

        - Humility when interacting with those you meet on this journey of life, will always be repaid in ways unexpected
    - [[Andy Henson]]
        - What you see isn't always what you get - appearances can be deceptive, even the smallest of us can help others

- Process:: 
    - What I get this is in regards to when writing a scene, and when writing a scene, and obstacles show up, and to layer conflict. Right, it's this idea of you're sitting in a car. And in the middle of winter, and it's like, it's a car. It's just a fucking car. But if it stalls in the middle of the fucking freeway, it's no longer a car. Now it's a tube. And that is the essence of how to create like real life, obstacles. That's what it is. And so, you know, overcoming anything in any scene involves that, and I think it's important to remember this very fucking interesting.
