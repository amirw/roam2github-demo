- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"Write about the best book you have ever read, and what made it great. What does this book need to do, to be similar?"
    1. [[Chinarut]] a book that shifts your mindset and world view or at the very least, gives you endless food for thought (nature of #inquiry) makes a great book. [[The 5 Essential Elements of Wellbeing]] is particularly exceptional because it came with a 3 month license to an app (Wellbeing Finder) to facilitate this shift in mindset (and contributed to an important body of research)
        - the book contains a framework to ‚Äúsort‚Äù your life within: (physical, social, community, financial, and career/purpose) wellbeing
        - it borrows from the method of the Clifton Strengths Finder which provides an app to assess what your ‚Äútop 5‚Äù strengths are (which its results are most powerful if you sort your life inside these 5 areas)
            - the reality is we bits and pieces of all strengths inside of.  the practice is not pinning yourself to these 5 strengths but rather the art of focusing on 5 hats and what happens when you focus at things that already excite you
            - here‚Äôs an example of how I apply this method:
                - **Futuristic** - I can‚Äôt wait to see how multiplayer mode in Roam pans out.  it excites me to think about different use cases for multiplayer mode and the future of large-scale global collaboration and the kinds of problem solving Roam enables
                - **Input** - Roam processes exponential input through the daily notes mechanism is elegant.  it is able to process input from a book club of this size yet we all have our private space and we are given the mechanisms to interweave our input and insights.
                - **Strategic** - book club is very strategic as whatever we figure out here can be applied to any field of study.  it‚Äôs recursive in some ways.
                - **Learner** - love learning what possible with Roam, love learning with others, love books, love synthesizing what we get from books into novel works. love teach others in a way that is scalable (and we aren‚Äôt talking YouTube videos!)
                - **Activator** - the time is now and love that Roam values experimentation to include the entire community (including its believers) in discovering what is on the fringes and what will push the development of Roam in potentially a new direction
    2. #[[Daily Writing Prompt]] [[Denise Todd]]
[[Michael E Gerber]] [[The E-Myth]] also the E-Myth revisited. 
Biggest takeaway  - you gotta have a process for scale.  Applied to all aspects of my life it creates efficiencies, but more importantly, makes things less of a hassle and allows me to focus on what I enjoy instead of the tedious. 
    3. [[Yingyue Liu]]#pomodorotechnique #books
[[The Pomodoro Technique]]
        - It helped me to define the granularity of immersing in reading, writing, and thinking.
It is more than imposing an exterior timeframe of 25 minutes work and 5 minutes rest. 
I standardized my daily work and started to observe and understand rhythm of life, just like how writing [[smart notes]] enables progressive writing.#zettel
            - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] I love this idea - that Pomodoros help give a feel for the "rhythm of life". I agree!
                - #Reply-from[[Yingyue Liu]]Thank you! I am still developing my habit of reviewing my work time at the end of the day with the recorded data in my Pomodoro timer app Forest.
            - #Reply-from [[Dan Allosso]] I was thinking of reading that book, but I was wondering about the potential loss of "flow" if I start breaking my work up into little chunks. Currently, I often look up from a task to find that hours have passed -- or I get called to supper and realize I've been at work for hours and lost track of time. Would I lose this if I had a timer telling me to take a break every 25 minutes?
                - #Reply-from[[Yingyue Liu]] It's like playing piano. The rhythm develops with deliberate practice.
            - #Reply-from [[Beau Haan üìå]] I suppose that's what I've been doing all along...üò≤ "It takes me around 10-20 minutes to actually write out a new permanent note, branch it, and then nest things accordingly."
                - #Reply-from[[Yingyue Liu]]That's exactly what I noticed! I like how the Pomodoro Technique could easily be integrated with the Smart Notes Technique.
            - #Reply-from[[Kate Foy üå±]] For me the Pomodoro technique at least gets me "warmed up" and reminds me to stand or move after the time is done. After that (hopefully) the flow will have kicked in and I can write as I need to. 
                - #Reply-from[[Yingyue Liu]]I really like that the structure gives me a chance to improve overtime. I accumulated a lot of rest techniques and it's also easier to know how much I would rest a day.
            - #Reply-from [[Denise Todd]] I'll have to read the book, but based just on the 25 on, 5 min off technique - I just use it when I'm stuck, or can't get started.  But then once I'm going, then I just go as long as the "flow" lasts.  
                - #Reply-from[[Yingyue Liu]]I practiced for a long time to develop the rhythm. I think it's great at least that I start to notice the rhythm thanks to the Pomodoro Technique.
    4. [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] #improvisation [[Keith Johnstone]] [[improvisation]] [[B/Improv in the Theater]] 
        - 
            - wow, great question, also, almost impossible for me to answer as there are too many "best books" on my list. 
                - I'm deliberately NOT going to choose the "best book I ever read" because then we start getting into the divergent purposes for which books are written, and I don't want to compare Soenke's handbook to a fictional or interpersonal-narrative book, because that would be apples-to-oranges 
                    - but I WILL compare Soenke to a book written in a similar spirit that I also love - **Keith Johnstone's "Improv in the Theater"**
                        - Like Ahrens, Johnstone sets out to offer his readers a paradigm shift
                        - Johnstone's book, aimed at actors, suggests that there might be some very simple, entry-level assumptions that they are making about their work, that are, in fact, completely wrong
                        - Like Ahrens, Johnstone suggests that instinct and intuition can be harnessed in the service of greater creativity, once we start paying attention to what we are REALLY doing behaviorally, not what we "think" we are doing or supposed to be doing
                        - If I could make one suggestion for Ahren's book inspired by what I love about Johnstone?
                        - That would be: __por favor__, **can you include detailed, personal stories, about what this technique helped you, the author, accomplish?**
                        - That might be a lot to ask though given that the first thing Soenke clearly had to do, was just research and describe the technique in its full context, give background, sources, etc etc
                        - Maybe he'll write the followup book in ten years
                        - Or maybe one of us will
                            - I'm looking at you [[@[[Beau Haan]]]]! 
                                - Somebody needs to write this book - maybe it should be you, friend!
                - (by the way ^^I LOVE these writing prompts^^, shoutout to whoever is putting them up)
    5. [[Juan Caicedo]] [[Test Driven Development by Example]] by [[Kent Beck]]
        - This book has shaped the way that I look at software development. 
        - The basic premise is that trying to solve a big problem in one go is never the best tactic. 
        - It's much better to break a problem down into smaller problems that can be verified
        - Small problems are easy to write automated tests for, which creates a short feedback loop
        - A short feedback loop removes the constraint of needing to store all the details of a problem in memory.
            - This allows you to focus on one part of the problem at a time and ignore all  the other details
    6. #[[Beau Haan üìå]] [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]]'s [[Book/Crime And Punishment]] hands-down has to be my favorite book
        - The way he shows the gentle decline from altruistic aims into the depths of absolute malevolence is truly remarkable.
        - There's something so powerful about watching how the decisions a person makes can take them down past the depths of hell into the domain of where even nightmares can't compare
        - The brokenness, the justifications, the descent into madness... all of it
        - And if the reader is paying attention, the thread that shows that same malevolence resides in each and every one of us
            - That's what really gets me
        - As for what would [[S√∂nke Ahrens]]' book have to be in order to be comparable, I think it's a different way of looking at the same thing
        - The mental exercise of paring away the things that are unnecessary with the understanding that the same hurdles that I face, will be the same thread that everyone goes through
        - I think the idea is that we are all capable of breaking through into the hopes that we will accomplish what we desire, and if we can only realize that we're not alone in this process, maybe... just maybe... we can achieve it~
    7. [[Kate Foy üå±]] Really, the whole canon of works by [[William Shakespeare]] - so rich and diverse, but the one I find most satisfying intellectually and emotionally is [[Macbeth]] written in 1606 but spot-on today in its examination of leadership and ambition. 
        - It examines the human condition and a fall from grace through digging in to the psychology of its protagonist.  The consequences of the mix of fate and ambition are enormously satisfying to read and see played out (put into action). That's where it really comes alive. Its poetry is magnificent.  
        - I'm drawing a long bow in attempting to link a play to a book like Sonke's, but try this: on the page the ideas are intriguing; when they are put into action they are transformative. Too much? ü§î  
- #Chat [[Beau Haan üìå]] I was thinking about this last night and posted it on the [[Slack]] channel, but figured I'd open up discussion about it here too
    - It takes me around 10-20 minutes to actually write out a new permanent note, branch it, and then nest things accordingly.
    - And I think that‚Äôs why so many people drop-off when attempting this way of note-taking.
    - It takes focus and concentration, since the words that end up inside of my [[Zettelkasten]] comes from an actual understanding of what I‚Äôm thinking.
        - Which could be the reason why I am forced to re-write it, since it takes that mental exercise in order to prove to myself that I truly comprehend and have assimilated what I'm learning
    - Do I love ending my long days with this half-hour of critical thinking? Not always, but yes, only because I can literally see how powerful this idea-generating machine is becoming.
        - #Reply-from [[Kate Foy üå±]] You're an owl, Beau? I'm a lark, and start my day this way - round 5am - and love the early-morning quiet when I'm rested and find my mind is at its best/sharpest. 
        - #Reply-from to [[Beau Haan]] I wonder if "so many people drop-off when attempting this way of note-taking" because they don't have a clear objective for the information and thus end up just linking "stuff" for the sake of linking‚Äì‚Äìso not worth the time cost.  Second,  the original thinking that goes into a permanent note has to have value, now or in the future.  And with a general societal need for instant gratification, the effort outweighs the value.  Very short term thinking, IMO.
