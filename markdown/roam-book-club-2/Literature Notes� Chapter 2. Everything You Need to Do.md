- [[Z: Thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas is the main work of everyone who studies, does research or writes --> so if you take your notes in a smart way, it will propel you forward]]
- Basic process of slip-box #[[Roam Meta]]
    - Create fleeting notes/literature notes
        - Is really not too much of a difference between literature notes and fleeting notes except where theyre coming from.
            - Fleeting notes tend to be what you jot down as the thought is passing through your head as a way to just get it down on paper
            - Literature notes are the notes you take when youre doing note taking in a more traditional manner
                - What you think you might use in your own thinking or writing
                - Try to use own words
                - Keep notes together w/ bibliographic details in one place
    - Create permanent notes from fleeting + literature
        - Written in a way that connects ideas interrelates with itself and so on
            - Notes should build off of each other. Like a conversation
        - Write one note for each idea
        - Write note as if you were writing it for a paper: full sentences, clear and brief
- The depository of notes is where you create, build and shape your thoughts/arguments
    - Opinions/thoughts you have are registered in slip box in a attempt to actually move forward with it
    - There is a momentum in your pursuit that just adds continually to the depository of your notes --> can translate into manuscript easily if done right
- By keeping notes in one place allows thought to be stored in a way that you can always run into it
    - When you are working on a project you naturally do research for that project. Oftentimes you are looking for an answer. When you do the reading there will naturally be insights which might not fit into your current paper but is interesting, related to another thought or an addition that you might not need in this specific context. 
        - It is a waste if you dont take down these notes as well because
            - This is still knowledge that can be used in another context
            - The project you are working on should not be treated as an isolated event but an exercise in expanding thought 
            - Generally enriches the web of thought of your slip-box
- #quote "^^A typical work day will contain many, if not all, of these steps^^: You read and take notes. You build connections within the slip-box, which in itself will spark new ideas. You write them down and add them to the discussion. You write on your paper, notice a hole in the argument and have another look in the file system for the missing link. You follow up on a footnote, go back to research and might add a fitting quote to one of your papers in the making. [*](((JyB58IMPZ)))" #[[Roam Meta]]
    - Point is to build this as a daily habit of thought generation. Wake up and take some notes on what you've read. Add to it and so on
