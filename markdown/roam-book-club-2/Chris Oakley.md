    - ""He not only stressed that he never forced himself to do something he didn‚Äôt feel like, he even said: ‚ÄúI only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.‚Äù (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f.)" - p. 15"

    - "‚ÄúWriting these notes is also not the main work. Thinking is. Reading is. Understanding and coming up with ideas is. And this is how it is supposed to be. The notes are just the tangible outcome of it. All you have to do is to have a pen in your hand while you are doing what you are doing anyway (or a keyboard under your fingers). Writing notes accompanies the main work and, done right, it helps with it. Writing is, without dispute, the best facilitator for thinking, reading, learning, understanding and generating ideas we have.‚Äù [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]] [*]([[Beau Haan üìå]])"
    - "Write about what stops you from finishing books?"
    - What is the gist of the book [[How To Take Smart Notes]]
        - To me, the gist of the book is that it outlines a method for a reader to capture the main elements from a written piece of work with the intent to:
            - make a reference summary that can be consulted later for refusing the reader on what the piece was about. 
            - help cement better understanding of a piece by forcing the reader to rewrite the authors thoughts in their own words.
            - collect atomic ideas or concepts about the work that can be used later as research points to later develop your own written pieces of work (books, articles, etc.) and write them quicker based on your own thoughts. 
        - Fleeting Notes
            - Fleeting notes are those notes gathered to retain a thought in the moment though they are unlikely to provide long-term value.
            - Fleeting notes are gathered in the moment. They are captured with whatever you have on-hand (scraps of paper, phone, etc.) They can serve as a todo list for later action or developing permanent notes. You should expect fleeting notes to end up in the trash.
