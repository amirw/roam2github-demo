    - [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
        - [[Goals for Book Club]]
            - This is a fascinating question, since I am filled with so many ideas of what this vision would look like...
            - I think first it deals with the enthusiastic way I am able to relay the information and education that I have been building upon
            - Next, it's the idea of clarifying the fundamental concepts that I have been practicing and creating an even more powerful structure that is impermeable to the effects of a critical mass can have on a digital [[Zettelkasten]]
            - There's also the rigorous community that is spawning from this #roamcult that I want to encourage and help assist in any way I can
            - There's lots of work to be done, and I know that I have the capacity and will to make things more beautifully effective. Connecting the simplicity of design, and aesthetics with the power of what [[Roam]] is capable of
            - Another goal is to really cement myself in the process that I have already developed and polishing out the parts of it that may be the weaker points, and to continue to grow by learning from others in this community
            - I also see opportunity in how to truly engage people, and to give them the tools that will radically change how they write, which in turn transforms how they think, and that eventually leading to transcendent behavioural changes that send ripples across this entire world
            - That's the ultimate goal. 
            - All of this has been fascinating and I am grateful above all else to be part of this, especially now, when there's so much to be fearful of.
            - [[Goals for Book Club]]
                - Besides my own personal goals, I see these next four-weeks as truly a groundbreaking opportunity to do what no other note-taking tool has been able to accomplish
                    - And that's to bring together a community through the tool in order to have a living and breathing archive of notes that truly resonates far longer than after this month 
                - There's key implications of how this can happen, including the innovation of truly creating a collaborative [[Zettelkasten]] inside of [[Roam]]
                    - Blocks and Notes
                    - Notes and Blocks
                - To raise everyone's "smart note taking" IQ in order to establish a firmer footing in which others can learn this too
                    - To clarify the process through showing and not telling 
                    - Writing and creating in a way that makes it easy to follow
                    - Structurally being able to bring this all together
                    - To find the core principles of this book and being able to truly apply it in a way that shows up in a habitual way, for me and others
                    - To solidify the community that has been growing exponentially and fostering that growth through enthusiasm and fun~
    - [[Questions for Sönke]]
        1. Was the discovery of [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s work akin to a Eureka! or more of a gradual process leading to a settling point?
        2. Where do you see this way of structuring notes impacting the world in the next several years?
        3. How would you describe the learning curve of applying the [[Zettelkasten]] in one's life?
        4. How idiosyncratic do you think each person's [[Zettelkasten]] will look after a critical mass of #[[Permanent Notes]] [[?]]

            -  #Reviewed
            - More structure with how the breakout rooms work and function
- # Session 3
    - 1st writing prompt
        - "Define a literature note in your own words."
            - When looked at from a broader perspective, it is merely a state that an idea is in, akin to the three states of matter. Solid, liquid, and gas.
                - I love this insight ;-) [[Bill Petro]]
            - Because the parts of what it is made up of are not lacking any from the previous state, it carries with it the fundamental character traits from when that idea is lifted from the fleeting notes stage.
            - It is a place to reference and cite the sources.
            - It is a place to incorporate the ideas from the fleeting note stage by discerning how well I understand the idea, through writing the literature note in my own words
            - The literature note in my opinion is in the liquid state
            - The ideas are malleable to the container in which it is stored in, yet can be placed into a permanent structure, transforming itself into a solid state
            - The fundamental idea behind the literature note is to have a place where I know the process in which I expand out this [[Zettelkasten]]
                - It gives me certainty amidst the confusion of knowing where things are supposed to go
                - Which is especially helpful when dealing with things that are not completely understood
        - "How do you take literature notes? Discuss your method."
            - The process in which I take literature notes is smashed together in the most stream-lined way. The reason I have been made everything so efficient is so when I need to get into the work, I have all the tools ready at hand. There's not warm-up. I just go
            - The initial step is always the fleeting ideas that enter into my head, but I do this with intense and critical discernment, since I can only encourage people to go down the path of prolific notes to see the overwhelm that ensues
            - After I stumble upon, or rather, my spirit guides me to something that resonates my whole core, and is something that relates to what I'm thinking about already, I take a voice memo note
                - In this note, I am conscious to record as much of what is going through my head as possible. 
                - This is interesting because I am able to maximize the technological advancements we have made since [[Niklas Luhmann]]'s time
            - Once I have captured that idea thoroughly in amber, I also have it automated to record as the title the exact source of where this idea manifested
            - I have a list of these captured notes in a list inside of [[Roam]] and at the end of the night, I begin pulling those into my `Daily Notes` page
            - That is when I listen back to the voice-memo, as well as read, listen, watch the source material, taking the actual literature notes of the source
            - This eventually leads to the creation of the new permanent note, but that is next week's meeting... 😉
        - "Have you found value in taking literature notes already?"
            - The value I've found has come most from realizing that when I am writing what I have read in my own words, it forces me into this litmus test of whether I understand what I have read or not!
        - "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?"
        - "Describe any enlightening moments you had while taking literature notes."
    - "I rather like the definition of a fleeting note by [[Beau Haan 📌]] "
- # Session 5
    - "{{[[DONE]]}} **Section 1** [[Writing practice]]"
        - "Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month. "
            - I am so inspired by all of the people that I have met along this path and the gratitude that I have for each and everyone that I have met is what inspires me and motivates me to continue to strive forward
            - As for the habits that I have built up over time, I feel like the pull from what I desire in regards to what I want in a [[Zettelkasten]] is pulling me like a wonderful wind from behind me
                - There is this beautiful moment in time it seems where the convergence of [[Roam]] and [[Zettelkasten]] and exponentially multiplied by the community that has surrounded this moment
        - "Pick from the prompts below and write in your own page for 15 minutes."
        - "Reflect on your Zettel process"
            - My personal [[Zettelkasten]] process has been such an arduous trek up a mountain that it seems no one has climbed before
            - As I continue to coach and inform others of the beauty of having a true dialogue partner the more clarity I get from this process
                - It's not mentorship, it's not apprenticeship, it's a vigil pursuit to expand our thinking in order to make the impact that we imagine when we close our eyes
            - As for the technicalities, my trust in the process has been fascinating, as I continue to stumble upon articles and original documents that support the fundamental concepts, and how they can be uniquely applied within this note-taking tool for networked thought
            - I can only imagine what it would be like to have such a fierce conversation partner, that is evidence based, and profoundly worldly in such varying topics and ideas, and then to be able to watch my own thinking evolve, change, and grow because I have literally written everything in my own words
            - That's powerful, but it's nothing to be kept in a silo, hidden and far off from others.
            - I want this because I can see the far-reaching effects of actually sharing our knowledge in ways that we truthfully cannot fathom
            - This is the burgeoning moment that perhaps the early Renaissance may have experienced. A moment in time, when everything in the world just clicked, and their visions would come alive~
- # >[[Live Session 6]]
    - ### Section 1
        - ---
            1. "What have you learnt about note taking that I (Sönke) should know about?"
                - The biggest thing that I learned about this process is that having a [[Zettelkasten]] inside of [[Roam]] might just be the best implementation of a digital version of the physical slip box
                - I can attest to this, because of the granularity of the block opposed to the page--has been the best example of what [[Niklas Luhmann]] talked about when he explained the autonomous conversation partner
                - There's something powerful about having the entry points, or index keywords baked into the block instead of the branch, in order to see past the note in focus
                - The physical limitations that [[Niklas Luhmann]] faced was one of not knowing what was going to be the next note in the actual slipbox
                - The index in a traditional slip box helped with that problem, but the digital version, has no need to see the actual nesting or [[Folgezettel]] because it's evident in how things are nested by indention
                - If now the granularity of the index, or keyword, lives on the block with the actual [[Permanent Notes]] then it allows for simplicity of knowing what's around the bend
                - The example that I have used is one of a car driving down a dark country road. The analog index would be something like the headlights that show what's around the bend.
                - Now with the advent of GPS and digital displays, you can actually see past the bend, even past the next several turns, so if the same fundamental aspect of what the index provided can be utilized to show what's inside the actual [[Permanent Notes]] it allows for quick thumbnails, or low resolution representations of the declarative statements
                - The power of this is multiplied when connecting the [[Relevant Notes]] and being able to `((Block Reference))` not just one piece of data, but both the index & the declarative statement 
            2. "Are there any additions to the process described in the book?"
            3. "Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten?"
                - The solution that a [[Zettelkasten]] offers might just be to solution to the overabundance of information that we are bombarded with every waking moment.
                - The notifications, the feedback loops, the echo chambers
                - The books that you want to read, the egotistical need want to have read more books than the next person--but not actually being able to use or even remember what the hell they read
                - Leading to this addiction of always wanting to be filled with information but never actually digesting what it really means
                - After 40+ coaching sessions over the last month, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that the biggest thing that each and EVERY ONE of the people I walked through a [[Zettelkasten]] was that they were pissed because they would consume, consume, consume, without actually utilizing or remembering what it was that they read
                - The power of working from the bottom-up reminds me of this idea of a young toddler who's main source of knowledge is their loving mother
                - As each day passes, they venture a step further into what they don't know, only to run back to what they are familiar with in order to build their knowledge of this world
                - And that reminds me of how a [[Zettelkasten]] truly works. It's about building knowledge acquired from others, until these threads of conversations begin showing us what we've truly digested
                - The problem is when the approach of top-down begins to creep back in, and even in the book you mention a similar situation
                - As the addiction to over-consumption starts to wane, the idea and powerful force of connections begins to win over that old behavior until it no longer feels as good to just have an archive
                - However there are cases when you just want to collect, and that's fine too within a true [[Zettelkasten]] so as long that conversation has an absolute firewall from the main conversation partner
                - I've been reading through all of the articles that have come from the German intellectuals as of late, and they point out a lot of things that really makes me think that this convergence of [[Zettelkasten]] and [[Roam]] may have been a marked occasion where the system finally met it's technology
                - With over 40+ Coaching Sessions, without fail, through every demographic, every age group, every skill level, every reason for wanting a [[Zettelkasten]] each of them not only understood the concepts, each of them applied them, and began their journey with a true conversation partner...
            4. "(what use cases does it work for? Are there any examples it doesn't work for?)"
        - ---
            1. "Reflect on your impressions of the book "
            2. "Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?"
            3. "Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?  "

- ### > Debriefing
    - Writing Prompt
        1. "You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say? "
            - What is a [[Zettelkasten]]? Jeez, isn't that the question of the year?
            - I feel like there's so much confusion about what and how to actually talk about this, that there has to a foundation upon which to build the whole idea around.
            - I think this starts from looking at what the problem was when [[Niklas Luhmann]] began developing this way of practically taking notes.
            - What was he going through? Why did he seek out such a way that would butt-up against the traditional way of taking notes
            - I think this is where the idea really began to take shape
            - There had to have been a reason for wanting something outside of the traditional ways of taking notes
            - And especially if [[Niklas Luhmann]] had a specific idea of what he wanted to discover on the way
            - His main focus was a complete study of Sociology and with the varied topics that that would entail, there had to be another way of organizing things in a simple, and practical manner
            - This is what a [[Zettelkasten]] is to me.
            - It's a solution a problem
        2. "Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits?"
            - It absolutely changed how I thought about what this whole thing was about
            - It was through the multiple conversations with people that really brought to light the power of what [[Sönke Ahrens]] was talking about in his book
            - There's something powerful about having a community in which to explore these complex ideas, and to have the multiple perspectives really gave an insight into how to really extract out the most important concepts that would allow for implementation in the digital realm
        3. "The book promotes a bottom up approach to note taking, which we have used in Book Club. Reflect on this. How did this feel? "
            - Jeez~ this is the most profound way of working and I can feel this sense of easy rolling off of my shoulders, since the whole process becomes this effortless exercise 
            - Even [[Sönke Ahrens]] talks about not limiting oneself to just a pinpoint focus on bottom-up structure, and I think he's absolutely right, since once the [[Zettels]] start building up, the top-down structure comes to life in the conversations that begin nesting
            - I think the idea of bottom-up has taken a lot of heat because of what it implies and what it really does is attacks how we have formed our knowledge building throughout our entire lives
            - This is definitely a tough pill to swallow if you really think about how we learn
            - But I also think that the bottom-up way of working may not be the best representation of how it looks
            - I think it's more of an inside-out way of working since as the knowledge is learned and added to what's already known, what happens is the extensions that happen in the branches begin threading outwards into newer and newer lands of wisdom
            - I can only really relate this to the opposite which would be like a large boulder, working from the outside-in, chipping away at what you know you want
            - Maybe that visualization helps explain the difference in approaches
            - Since even now when I think about how we're traditionally taught in school, it usually has this strict idea of time and periods, semesters and quarters.
            - But I don't think that's how knowledge building works
            - It's essentially looking at this whole process as a way of life instead of a way to seek out the answers in order to pass/fail
            - Which excites me most about all of this!
        4. "What's your favourite blocks (or quotes) from the book?"
            1. "He constantly generated more ideas than he was able to write down. His texts read as if he is trying to squeeze as much insight and as many ideas as possible into one publication.[*](((jCXXAWuQo)))"
                - The power in that statement is extraordinary
                - He was able to avoid the dreaded blank-page and not only did he solve that problem, he was able to figure out how to do it in a way that could be taught
                - Which is the most powerful thing, because having the best way to do something is useless if it can't be taught and given to someone in dire need of a solution
            2. "Studies on highly successful people have proven again and again that success is not the result of strong willpower and the ability to overcome resistance, but rather the result of smart working environments that avoid resistance in the first place[*](((hhTaHBEnz)))"
                - And to not have resistance when attempting to do the hard things in life, really allows for the sacrifice of time that it takes to build out a knowledge database, becomes essential!
            3. "3. The third and maybe the most important reason is the very fact that it is simple. Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas. They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means.[*](((j85ILtzRh)))"
                - The results are compounded actions 
            4. "By adding these links between notes, Luhmann was able to add the same note to different contexts[*](((k1R5hvOJl)))"
            5. "We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains[*](((kVuIQFmCg)))"
            6. 
    - 2nd Writing Prompt
        - "Reflect on Roam Book Club"
            - I think there's such a desperate clutching to old ways of doing things that hinders the actualization of a [[Zettelkasten]]
            - I really relate this whole process to how the discoveries of Newton, though powerful and world-changing, actually became nested inside of the extraordinary output by Einstein
            - This is really what it's about, for me. It's approaching this entire discussion with an open-mind and even humbling ourselves to the successes we may have had up to this point with knowledge-building and actually learning
            - This is also what strikes me the most, because I see that something like "how we learn" or "how to take smart notes" or "how to build knowledge" is one of the most fundamental aspects of our personality AND identity
            - To attack that, with willingness from oneself, is something that the great thinkers have also proclaimed, and I don't think it's lost any of that power
            - There's an easy path to walk, and it usually leads to mediocre results, but the pain of actually having to unpack decades, upon decades of learning and knowledge building is not something to take lightly
            - But, I think there's something important to remember and it's that at one point the entire known civilization thought the Sun revolved around the Earth
            - Maybe there's a distinct power in realizing that maybe we don't have all of the answers, and even if we did, what would we do with it? How can we actually use what we're learning? What are the hindrances that come from not the system itself, but from the source of who I am fundamentally
