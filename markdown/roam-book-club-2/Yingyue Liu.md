 I finished reading the book, took fleeting notes, and wrote [the book review in Chinese](https://book.douban.com/review/12949540/). This book started my life of integrating reading, writing, and thinking. I started the challenge of 365 days of 6-index-card-a-day.

    - [[Afterword]]
- You start a conversation with a stranger in the street. They ask you what is a Zettelkasten. What do you say?  
    - Zettelkasten is a note-taking system that emphasises creating links among your own ideas and notes concisely written in your own words, which could be revisited in the future without confusion.
- 2. Reflect on your reading and writing habit through Book Club. Did the emphasis and exploration of Sonke's book change your reading and writing habits? 
    - Yes. I think much deeper than before. More importantly, I develop my reading, thinking, and writing process. It's now a much longer and consistent route than before: fleeting notes, literature notes, Zettels, draft, and final draft. 
    - My reading and writing also became multidimensional. I not only jot down notes from the literature. I also create links between notes and meditate on the graph overviews. Most importantly, I generate new ideas from my notes.
    - I start to assess my daily productivity by Zettels. And whenever I don't feel like writing, I start a Pomodoro and dump some words into bullets. Then the daily practice of Zettel-writing comes back and I start to produce meaningful words.
    - Recently, I figured out that Roam Research could be integrated with my Pomodoro app Forest. And you could choose different modes of focus. That's something I want to explore during the coming week.
- 3. The book promotes a bottom up approach to note taking, which we have used in Book Club. Reflect on this. How did this feel?  
    - It grounds both my reading and thinking.
    - I'd prefer developing my own mixed-methods. Integrating text-analysis methods, structures, with daily note taking. I think the most important benefit of a bottom up approach is the inclusivity and flexibility that enables us to produce words helps promote deeper understanding about the complexity of the world. 
- 4. What's your favourite blocks (or quotes) from the book?
    - "Because the slip-box is not intended to be an encyclopedia, but a tool to think with, we don’t need to worry about completeness. We don’t need to write anything down just to bridge a gap in a note sequence. We only write if it helps us with our own thinking. The gaps we do need to concern ourselves with are the gaps in the arguments in the final manuscript–but these gaps will only become obvious in the next step, when we take the relevant notes for an argument out of the network of the slip-box and sort them into the linear order for the rough draft."
