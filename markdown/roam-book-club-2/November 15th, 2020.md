                - "We have the best chance to change our behaviour over the long term if we start with a realistic idea about the difficulties of behavioural change (Dean 2013). And that is not so easy, because the more we are used to doing something in a particular way, the more in control we feel about it, even though we are less in control of it. (This is in part also due to the aforementioned mere-exposure error.)"

- #Chat [[Denise Todd]] Great bookclub session today.  Thanks to all.  
- #Chat [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] Lulz~ https://twitter.com/beauhaan/status/1328085442260992000?s=20
- #Chat [[Chinarut]] my mind is absolutely being blown summarizing these chapters and coming up with literature notes.  Iâ€™m capturing concepts (to help write my literature notes) and it is awesome to see who else shares the same concepts and lines of thinking in our book club ðŸ¤¯
    - example for chapter 1: "[[getting unstuck]] [[value of adaptive structure]] [[idea process as structure]] [[cost of compartmentalization]] [[transforming GTD]] [[starting from abundance]] [[nature of control]] [[limitations of our brains]]"
        - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] I love this idea of creating a "concepts" tag-line for every chapter. I am going to adopt this, thanks. 
- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"What does it mean to elaborate on something you've read? What sort of elaboration techniques work best while reading?"
    1. [[Yingyue Liu]]Each time I read, I develop from understanding less to understanding more. #howtoreadabook
        - To elaborate on things I've read means to **verbalize the gap between "less" and "more": how the reading experience makes me different than before. **Besides, I also need to explain what the reading material is and what's the next step.
        - While I am reading, I keep a box of index cards, 1 highlighter pen, and 2 gel pens (black/red) at hand. I would set a **pomodoro timer**, and start reading and taking notes with these tools one Pomodoro after another. I sometimes write on the margin of the book, or underline sentences. But I would mostly take notes on index cards, mark the sequence and pages for later writing. I limit myself to **handwriting with paper and pens** as much as possible. But when writing permanent notes, I would use Roam Research. 
        - Freewriting for 5 minutes after I finished daily reading is also something I do to best capture my impression and state my intention before I start developing the slip-box.
    2. [[Denise Todd]] To elaborate, for me means to expand outside the original context.  See what it means to me, how it applies in a different discipline.  For example, a lot of what I'm reading about taking notes also applies to fiction writing, financial management, and even cooking for a big event.  
        - As for technique, no actual process.  When something stands out to me I highlight it, then "noodle" on it for a bit and specifically ask questions like "how could this apply elsewhere" and "what if the opposite were true" or "where have I seen this in action."  Then write about what pops into my head.  Not very scientific for this group, I realize, but it serves my purposes well. 

    3. [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] for me the elaboration of a thing has two components -
        - explaining it so that a motivated twelve year old could understand it (there's that famous possibly apocryphal quote from Einstein that suggested you explain it to a 6 year old but I'm going to go with 12 because that seems closer to the mark for me)
        - linking it to other texts, other experiences, or related key ideas
        - #Reply-from[[Yingyue Liu]]Good idea! I am an international graduate student in the US. Inspired by your 12-year-old technique, I would make it my monthly goal to explain one section of my dissertation to my parents through our video chats.
- #[[Quick Capture]] [[Michelle Y]]
    - Is it possible to skip literature notes and go from fleeting to permanent notes? seems tedious to do fleeting notes, then literature notes, then permanent. or is it possible to skip fleeting notes and go directly to literature notes? is it possible to have no permanent notes directly related to a single book? and do only permanent notes go into the slip box or do literature notes get included too?
        - #Reply-from [[Matt McKinlay]]
            - Previously I would normally skip literature notes, often relying on fleeting notes into permanent notes. 
                - I have tried to extend my time reading and writing literature notes this time. 
                    -  Am finding that it's giving me a lot of ideas and understanding I missed in my fleeting notes. 
            - I am starting to think I could get rid of fleeting notes, and just focus on literature and permanent.  
            - Maybe 90%? of the value is in the processing, rather than exposure to ideas.
