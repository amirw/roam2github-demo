- In the Zettelkasten system, topic tags are chosen very, very selectively. I’m a little less rigid about the limits on tagging, but I still try not to add more than 3-5 tags.
- First, I add at least one relevant topic tag from the [Syntopicon index](https://www.thegreatideas.org/tgi-alphabetical.html). Over time, I hope to create my own customized and expanded version of the Syntopicon.
- Second, I add 1-2 topic tags from my own personal list, mainly philosophical and theological topics.
- Lastly, I add topic tags that are connected to current areas of interest or active writing projects. For these, I don’t ask: "How should I store this note?" Instead, I ask: "How do I want to stumble upon this note in the future?"
