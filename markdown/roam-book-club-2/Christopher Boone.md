    - [[Introduction]]
        - ["Every intellectual endeavor starts with a note."](((mf_7b5vEA)))
            - The implications of this are beautiful. Every note can be the seed of an idea.
        - ["We don't experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly."](((1NqxVWlvh)))
            - We commonly misidentify the problems we face in writing.
            - We believe the floundering is inherent to the process.
        - ["This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas."](((AmpvncRaE)))
            - The goal of this book is to teach us how to leverage the process of note-taking itself into a powerful practice of learning and idea generation along the way.
        - ["Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there."](((VQiKWP6bz)))
            - It's easier to reference and reshape already-written notes rather than try to recall and formulate the entire piece in your head from scratch. 
        - ["What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand."](((KqvBsDubC)))
            - The strongest indicator of academic success, and probably success more generally, is self-disciple and self-control.
        - ["Self-discipline or self-control is not that easy to achieve with willpower alone. Willpower is, as far as we know today, a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term."](((tIetkYe5Q)))
            - I'm really glad he brought this up.
            - It seems like most people miss the fact that willpower and discipline are variable capacities just like height or intelligence.
        - ["Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success."](((tIetkYe5Q)))
            - This reminds me of Getting Things Done.
            - If I have a clear understanding of what the most basic Next Action is my brain will more readily act upon it.
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - [[Everything You Need To Know]]
            - ["By breaking down the amorphous task of “writing a paper” into small and clearly separated tasks, you can focus on one thing at a time, complete each in one go and move on to the next one ."](((N9B8GYzJr)))
                - This whole block is quite literally just GTD applied to writing. But I'm totally here for it.
                - I'm reminded of the GTD distinction between "Projects" vs. "Next Actions"
                - For example, nobody has ever "planned a conference." There's no such task that can be accomplished in one fell swoop. Instead, that overarching Project is broken down into the various sub-steps that go together to achieve planning the party like making a guest list, calling a caterer, sending out invitations, booking a venue, create a schedule, etc. Those are all sub-steps that, taken together, fulfill the original goal of "planning a conference."
            - ["Having a clear structure to work in is completely different from making plans about something. If you make a plan, you impose a structure on yourself; it makes you inflexible...It is a huge misunderstanding that the only alternative to planning is aimless messing around. "](((e5t8EGtoY)))
                - We mistakenly think of Plans and Structure as being symmetrical and equivalent to each other.
            - ["The challenge is to structure one’s workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the driving forces that push us forward. We do not want to make ourselves dependent on a plan that is threatened by the unexpected, like a new idea, discovery–or insight."](((e5t8EGtoY)))
                - This highlights the difference between a plan vs. a productive structure. The idea that a new insight could "derail" our plan points to how "plans" can be unhelpfully rigid.
        - [[1.1 Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected]]
            - ["The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level."](((vhg4vhrk2)))
                - Content and insights are emergent phenomena growing out from a simple structure and set of rules.
            - ["Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly. Only when all the related work becomes part of an overarching and interlocked process, where all bottlenecks are removed, can significant change take place."](((ez0DqkFlC)))
                - Again, simplicity and consistency are king.
            - ["The principle of GTD is to collect everything that needs to be taken care of in one place and process it in a standardised way. This doesn’t necessarily mean that we actually do everything we once intended to do, but it forces us to make clear choices and regularly check if our tasks still fit into the bigger picture. Only if we know that everything is taken care of, from the important to the trivial, can we let go and focus on what is right in front of us."](((ngW0psLUC)))
                - There it is!
            - ["Unfortunately, David Allen’s technique cannot simply be transferred to the task of insightful writing. The first reason is that GTD relies on clearly defined objectives, whereas insight cannot be predetermined by definition."](((PxFYE_wSD)))
                - This makes sense, and highlights again the difference between a plan vs. structure.
                - However, it's interesting that even though the precise structure of GTD doesn't map exactly onto the writing process, the __general structure__ of "having a structure" holds true!
            - ["What we can take from Allen as an important insight is that the secret to a successful organization lies in the holistic perspective. Everything needs to be taken care of, otherwise the neglected bits will nag us until the unimportant tasks become urgent."](((1OmI74xT0)))
            - ["And this is the other insight of David Allen: Only if you can trust your system, only if you really know that everything will be taken care of, will your brain let go and let you focus on the task at hand."](((wAz831-X5)))
        - [[1.2 The Slip-box]]
            - ["Only if the work is set up in a way that is flexible enough to allow these small and constant adjustments can we keep our interest, motivation and work aligned–which is the precondition to effortless or almost effortless work."](((oz882t9yv)))
            - ["The main misunderstanding stems from an isolated focus on the slip-box and a neglect of the actual workflow in which it is embedded."](((j85ILtzRh)))
            - ["The third and maybe the most important reason is the very fact that it is simple. Intuitively, most people do not expect much from simple ideas. They rather assume that impressive results must have equally impressively complicated means."](((j85ILtzRh)))
        - [[1.3 The slip-box manual]]
            - ["Luhmann had two slip-boxes: a bibliographical one, which contained the references and brief notes on the content of the literature, and the main one in which he collected and generated his ideas, mainly in response to what he read."](((fDWyGkGQL)))
            - ["Whenever he read something, he would write the bibliographic information on one side of a card and make brief notes about the content on the other side. These notes would end up in the bibliographic slip-box."](((nN5f1vjN_)))
                - This is a step that I haven't done in my own notes, but it makes perfect sense. I might go back and try to collate the sources I've pulled from.
            - ["In a second step, shortly after, he would look at his brief notes and think about their relevance for his own thinking and writing. He then would turn to the main slip-box and write his ideas, comments and thoughts on new pieces of paper, using only one for each idea and restricting himself to one side of the paper, to make it easier to read them later without having to take them out of the box. He kept them usually brief enough to make one idea fit on a single sheet, but would sometimes add another note to extend a thought."](((55MjPqvfQ)))
                - This reminds me of Richard Feynman's advice to have 10-12 open questions and then see how everything you come across might apply to solving those questions.
            - ["He did not just copy ideas or quotes from the texts he read, but made a transition from one context to another. It was very much like a translation where you use different words that fit a different context, but strive to keep the original meaning as truthfully as possible."](((iKecBcypp)))
                - This again reminds me of taking a __structural__ approach to knowledge and truth. The same structure might apply to different ideas. Finding that core structural similarity may uncover an deeper shared principle.
            - ["The trick is that he did not organise his notes by topic, but in the rather abstract way of giving them fixed numbers. The numbers bore no meaning and were only there to identify each note permanently. If a new note was relevant or directly referred to an already existing note, such as a comment, correction or addition, he added it directly behind the previous note. If the existing note had the number 22, the new note would become note number 23. If 23 already existed, he named the new note 22a. By alternating numbers and letters, with some slashes and commas in between, he was able to branch out into as many strings of thought as he liked. For example, a note about causality and systems theory carried the number 21/ 3d7a7 following a note with the number 21/ 3d7a6."](((U4Q7m4mQO)))
                - So there is a web of interconnection that is built out of a different layer of abstraction. This seems really important. The super-structure of interconnected meanings is not actually made out of "meaningful" content itself. This allows for patterns to become visible which might not jump out if the medium of connection was "meaningful" content.
            - ["But, as I will explain later, they are quite different and it would be rather misleading to think of his slip-box as a personal Wikipedia or a database on paper. The similarities are obviously there, but the subtle differences are what makes this system unique."](((LAHvoWGna)))
                - I'm intrigued to learn about these subtle difference because as Sonke mentioned earlier small tweaks to a process can produce large results.
                - I'm new to Roam, but it appears to be structured more in the hyperlink/Wikipedia model so I wonder if Luhmann/Ahren's approach has subtle, but meaningful, advantages.
            - ["The last element in his file system was an index, from which he would refer to one or two notes that would serve as a kind of entry point into a line of thought or topic. Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points."](((gq3S3MuUq)))
            - ["And if I were forced to boil it down to a single bullet point, it would be this: We need a reliable and simple external structure to think in that compensates for the limitations of our brains."](((kVuIQFmCg)))
    - [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]
        - [[Everything You Need To Do]]
            - ["Only with a less narrow focus will you be able to see connections and patterns."](((gG5gSVgXN)))
                - This reminds me of the point I made [back here*](((cfdzJ-RXR))) about the network of connections being visible at a higher level of abstraction. The abstraction and insight is made possible by the fact that the "material" of the structural reference layer is *not* made out of "meaningful" content. If it were made up of meaningful content then we wouldn't be able to see the abstract structural interconnection as easily because we'd be looking *at* the networking structure via content rather than *through* the networking structure via an abstracted layer like his reference numbers.
            - [[2.1 Writing a paper step by step]]
    - [[The Four Underlying Principles]]
        - [[Chapter 5. Writing is the Only Thing That Matters]]
            - "There is no such thing as private knowledge in academia. An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas." [*](((5Bxb_J2dj)))
            - "And truth is always a public matter. Everything within the university aims at some kind of publication. A written piece does not necessarily need to be accepted in an international journal to become public. In fact, the vast majority of what is written and discussed is not published in this narrow sense. The review process itself is a form of presenting an idea publicly to the peers and so is everything a student hands over to a professor or lecturer. Even the handout for a presentation discussed with fellow students is a written piece made public. It is public because in the discussion, it does not matter anymore what the author meant, only what is there in writing. The moment the author can be removed from the scene, the written piece is a public claim on truth. The criteria for a convincing argument are always the same, regardless of who the author is or the status of the publisher: They have to be coherent and based on facts. Truth does not belong to anyone; it is the outcome of the scientific exchange of written ideas. This is why the presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin."  [*](((U0_AKhDHt)))
                - This reminds me of [[Meeting the Universe Halfway]] by [[Karen Barad]]. She discusses how meaning and truth are created through "marks on bodies" - it is always an embodied, material process.
            - ["Working as if nothing else counts than writing does not mean spending more time writing at the expense of everything else."](((pbn4HW864)))
                - He goes on to explain how writing weaves through and balances out with all of the other aspects of learning and developing ideas. 
                - The way we engage with reading, lectures, discussions, etc. all become more focused when they are practiced through the lens of writing being both the means and the end.
        - [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
            - "We tend to think that big transformations have to start with an equally big idea. But more often than not, it is the simplicity of an idea that makes it so powerful (and often overlooked in the beginning)....I am speaking, or course, about the shipping container." [*](((Zo2Uaa6y3)))
                - This relates to "plans vs. structure" again [back here*](((4WxDkQTNQ)))
                - A small, simple structure (or structural change) can be a powerful engine of unexpected emergent phenomena.
            - "In hindsight, we know why they failed: The ship owners tried to integrate the container into their usual way of working without changing the infrastructure and their routines. They tried to benefit from the obvious simplicity of loading containers onto ships without letting go of what they were used to. In the beginning, the perception was very much shaped by what worked before, and only the most immediate effects were visible." [*](((9eRcB8Tey)))
                - This is reminds me of the debate I've been having with Casey about [[ranked choice voting]].

    - [[Section 1 Writing task]]
        - Discuss the fleeting note phase
            - [Here's an elaboration on fleeting notes from the book](((wmFEVrD5o)))
            - What does the concept of fleeting notes mean to you? 
                - I think I may be misunderstanding fleeting notes still.
                - I went back and re-read this section about fleeting notes in the book.
                - As I began reading the book this week I was "taking notes," but I think doing it in such a way that they weren't truly either fleeting notes or permanent literature notes
                - I was doing neither method completely so I ended up doing neither method well
            - Define a fleeting note in your own words. 
                - I understand fleeting notes to be a very brief reminder or reference of an idea/insight or where to find something you want to return to.
                - These can be recorded quickly on paper or digitally. A centralized place that you'll return to later to translate them into permanent notes.
                - If it's your own idea it would be deep enough that you could recall and unpack the rest of the idea later when you add it into your permanent notes.
                - If it's in relation to a text then it could be an underline or highlight, but as Sonke points out in the book, if those notes aren't translated into permanent notes soon they'll lose their context.
                - 
            - How did you take fleeting notes? Discuss your method.
                - I'm not sure if I did take true fleeting notes.
                - I initially started by reading through the book in Roam, and copied over passages/block references into my notes and jotted down my own thought as a child note under that.
                - I'm wondering if that approach started to edge into half-baked literature/permanent notes, but without the full benefit because I don't yet know how to take robust literature/permanent notes.
                - "Jack of all trades, master of none" I think my style of notes was straddling the line between fleeting and permanent so the notes failed at achieving either.
            - What is the value of fleeting notes?  For this book, and for previous books you have read?
                - Not zero, but I definitely feel the truth of his point about needing to translate them into full-fledged literature/permanent notes soon after because alot of the context for those original underlinings has been lost to the sands of time.

        - Gleb Reys

        - QUESTION: Now that you’re a Roam user with no pen in hand, how has Roam changed your work (process and content) as well as your sense of the possibilities for note taking?
            - He says: It's difficult to tell because small changes might make a bigger difference over time.
                - One possible downside is if we get too caught up in making connections
                - Feels more free to make sequences in pages that link together ideas and other notes
        - QUESTION: What aspects of Roam differs from or makes difficult the process of Zettelkasten
        - QUESTION: What problem do you see people have most frequently.
            - Balancing top-down with bottom-up
                - He feels like the book might have over-focused on the bottom-up approach
