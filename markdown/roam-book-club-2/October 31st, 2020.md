        - Having trouble scrolling? Might be the new update, since I don't see any JS enabled?
        - ~~Hmm... works on my own graph, tho... maybe CSS problems? I've got no idea...~~
        - It's definitely the most recent update... personal graph isn't functioning correctly either... ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ðŸ˜¬ 
            - ^^Only on MacOS Safari^^, it seems... I guess i'm using Google Chrome until this is resolved... ugh~ ~~#dontBeEvil~~
