- #Zettels [[Zettels are nodes in a network, especially in Roam. You might connect the overarching concept to another, but through exploring the different paths of literature and fleeting notes, generate many different types of output through the same Zettel]]
    - "#[[Literature Notes]] Proper notetaking has a network effect -  additional notes will strengthen arguments and clarify thinking. Poor notetaking has the opposite effect."
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] In contrast to the fleeting notes, every permanent note for the slip-box is elaborated enough to have the potential to become part of or inspire a final written piece, but that can not be decided on up front as their relevance depends on future thinking and developments. The notes are no longer reminders of thoughts or ideas, but contain the actual thought or idea in written form. This is a crucial difference. [*](((UZ4XCHfSA)))
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] A typical mistake is made by many diligent students who are adhering to the advice to keep a scientific journal.  [*](((7GWVsCHA5)))
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The second typical mistake is to collect notes only related to specific projects.  [*](((HlsQj7ZDO)))
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The third typical mistake is, of course, to treat all notes as fleeting ones.  [*](((V8bEn02_W)))
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] ^^The slip-box is not a collection of notes. Working with it is less about retrieving specific notes and more about being pointed to relevant facts and generating insight by letting ideas mingle. ^^([Location 1048](https://readwise.io/to_kindle?action=open&asin=B06WVYW33Y&location=1048))
- #Zettels [[Employing a zettelkasten system is like any other healthy habit; it provides a foundation for learning and becomes the one decision that determines a thousand others in the future.]]
    - "#[[Literature Notes]] If you take the approach you will write about everything you are learning, you will automatically become a more critical reader and thinking, and likely be more discerning on the information you consume."
        - #quote Even if you decide never to write a single line of a manuscript, you will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing. [*](((9LdD6VzxA)))
    - "#[[Literature Notes]] Developing a good notetaking system requires systems thinking - don't get lost in the minutia of a particular passage or topic, always keep an eye on how it contributes to your entire body of knowledge."
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] The more you learn and collect, the more beneficial your notes should become, the more ideas can mingle and give birth to new ones–and the easier it should be to write an intelligent text with less effort. [*](((wIYnbucZC)))
