- Fleeting Notes:: 
    - A smart working environment is one that avoids resistance in the first place and accommodates our work rhythm (17). 
        - discovering our inner rhythm is important
        - designing systems that take into account our inner rhythm
    - Having both the right tools and knowing how to use them. 
        - roam research + luhman's system
    - How can apply this method of learning to my current study of biology and IBD?
    - the slipbox allows us to learn in the most optimal manner because we are always making connections and "hooking" our ideas to other ideas.
    - developing my creativity machine by building my slipbox

    - Live Session Writing
    - When I was a kid, I wanted to be an inventor, someone who created new realities in the world. As I was heading off to university, I set out to develop the skills to become an entrepreneur. Part of being an Internet entrepreneur is being able to write, remix, and make new connections. Now that I am honoring myself by pursuing the path of building a business, I am implementing the Zettelkasten to be able to create a graph of my best insights, as well as the ideas I have in development, and linking them together to help me best serve others and be able to notice the small differences that can potentially create paradigm shifts in my work as well as my creative pursuits. Zettelkasten is one of the tools that allows me to bring my ideas into the world and creates opportunities for synchronicities to happen.

    - #[[Zettels]] [[By identifying our true desire and acting on it with clear action, we can create an effortless feedback loop that allows us to move past the early stages of acquiring new habits]]
        - #[[Literature Notes]] [Chapter 14. (Paragraph 6))](((4hIM0I_l_)))
            - We can deliberately adopt new habits by identifying the first step, which is identifying one's true desire and then taking the first step.
            - As we continue, we can eventually act without effort and create a virtuous feedback loop.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Doing something new requires you to "put in the reps" but it can be done non-coercively by using our personal interest as the guiding action.
            - We can't eliminate old habits without replacing it with something new.
            - It's all about doing something new 100 times. The first times you do it are the hardest.
            - Putting in the reps is a phrase that people use in bodybuilding and weightlifting.

- Fleeting notes are important, why? Highlighting and commenting notes are good for fleeting notes (thoughts) kindle or pdf.
- Connecting notes together - 
- Tag everything
- {{[[TODO]]}} Build a practice of how can I connect these notes - is there anything recent to what I am writing about now, or use block references (double parenthesis) and pick one of the keywords (creativity) and see what pops up. 
- Weekly cadences are daunting.
