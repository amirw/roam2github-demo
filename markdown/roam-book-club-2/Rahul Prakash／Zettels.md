            - Flow of work is like thermodynamics. Some work needs you to spend energy and other work energizes you. 
            - The second one with flow state is what we want. And having control on the kind of work we can involve ourselves with gives a better chance of choosing work that will be energizing. 
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] Having control on what I choose to work on is important because having that choice allows me to work on things I am interested in. I can then achieve flow state that leaves me energized and more satisfied by my work. 
            - Achieving flow state
                - It's energizing instead of depleting
                - Engrossed in the work, there is no sense of time
                    - Where did the time go by?
                        - Not focused on anything else
                        - Distractions don't have power
                - When it's done, you don't feel drained
                    - They just rest and recharge
                - You finish that and feel energized
            - This is something I would like to pursue
                - I would like to make sure that the activities that I am ending up involving, allows me achieve this flowstate
                - In bigger organizations, they define my work
                    - Which may or may not help achieve that state
                - I want to choose, since the chances are higher
                - More satisfying
                    - More output
            - In general when I am involved in work, if I'm not intrinsically engaged in
                - It's difficult
                    - I do a poor job
                    - It sucks my energy 
                        - It takes more energy to do it
            - Compared to flow state
                - Polar opposite
                    - Anti-flow
            - Emotional why, this is a good example of that
                - I want control over my choices, so I can choose to make sure I'm involved in activities where flow state is possible
                    - I don't know how else to explain, this is the crux of the conversation until now
                    - There is a desire to make sure that I am part of activities that energize me
                        - More possible with more control
                            - Bigger organizations, diminish for me

- the [[nature of work]] is quite like thermogenic reactions. Most times you have to spend energy to get the work done. But, sometimes, when you get into a flow state, it feels different and you are actually getting energized by the doing of the work itself. This flow state is what we are looking to achieve [*](((RK0T2uHBh)))
    - __This happens most of the time to me when I am interacting with an idea or a piece of content that I am really interested in. And what happens is that I can concentrate for a long time without losing interest or feeling a drain on my energy. If all the reading could be so, and I can convert my writing to this flow state, the creation process would be so much more smoother.__
