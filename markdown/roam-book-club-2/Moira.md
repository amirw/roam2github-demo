    - [[Introduction]]
        - [[Writing]] is universal. Writing is used to remember, to think, to describe, to explain, to figure out things, to explore, to prepare for something.
            - Thus everyday [[Note-taking]] is the basis of writing. If you do it properly, efficiently, in an organized way, this will improve your writing. However, if you do it badly there are no apparent immediate consequences. So the incentive to improve it is not evident and not strong
            - Note-taking in a way that surfaces [[connection]] and original [[thinking]]
            - Writing is the medium of [[Learning]], not a consequence
            - Good writing is based on good note-taking. 
        - "the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people’s heads, but in the way they do their everyday work"
            - [[systems]] beat [[goals]]
            - [[Compounded interest]]
            - Anne Lammott, Bird by Bird
        - Also [[Self-discipline]] plays an important role 
            - This is also linked to your work environment. Ref. engineering your environment to support building and maintaining good [[habits]] and a good [[workflow]]
        - Having meaningful, well defined [[Tasks]] beats  [[Willpower]], because you don't need to use it.
        - Do the hard work required, and do it in a smart way
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - **Good structure helps you moving throughout your** [[**workflow**]] **and it enables** [flow]([[Flow]])
            - This is different than making plans about something where you impose a structure upon it. Difference between structure and [planning]([[Planning]])
        - Effects of [[Knowledge]] and [[Insight]]
            - Experts become so because they have a **structure that allows them to generate** [[Insight]]
            - [[Dunning-Kruger Effect]], not knowing the extent of one's own ignorance, which is the opposite of the Socratic "[[I know that I know nothing]]"
            - People who know more, know the vast amount of [[Knowledge]] they don't have, and suffer from the [[Imposter syndrome]]
        - [[Writing]] **is the main tool to achieve** [[Insight]] **worth sharing**
        - ### **Chapter 1.1 Good Solutions are Simple - and Unexpected**
            - **Because** [[Knowledge]] **is complex,** [[complexity]] **will be a feature of your system.** Do not try to simplify it too much otherwise it will become complicated  just to record all the pieces. Complexity is manageable, and good
                - Avoid trade-off between usability and usefulness
            - Create a slipbox, or in this case a Roam, and change your working [[habits]]; work with it daily 
            - An overarching, structured [[workflow]] allows you to work well and accomplish things. This was the added value of the GTD system, which has one central "inbox" and a way of addressing things in a standardised way, offering in return the opportunity of a "mind like water", clear and free to concentrate
            - [[Writing]] **is not a linear process, it requires jumping back and forth  between steps that are closely connected.** A holistic perspective allows this to happen easily
        - ### **Chapter 1.2 The Slipbox**
            - Luhmann created the Slip-box to include context with his [[Ideas]] and connect them
            - Over time the Slip-box became so complex and full of information and [[Insight]] that it became a dialogue partner
            - This allowed him to generate more [[Ideas]] than he was able to write down, and brought him to his theory of society that famously took 30 years and zero cost.
            - It also allowed him to avoid [[procrastination]]. He said : “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.”
            - It also makes work more fun
            - And hard work is fun if it is aligned with our intrinsic [[goals]] and we feel in control. Just like it talks about [[Motivation]] in  [[Chapter 1. Motivation]] in [[Book/Smarter, Faster, Better]]
            - To keep in control, keep your mind open while [[Writing]] because questions change and opinions change too, it is the nature of the process itself. Flexibility allows for adjustment which maintains interest, [[Motivation]] and work aligned
            - This also helps avoiding [[Resistance]] which is referred to in [[Book/The War of Art]] by [[Stephen Pressfield]]
                - Highly productive people deflect [[Resistance]] like judo champions #Productivity
                    - Use your opponent strength against him. Even if your opponent is, in fact, [[Resistance]]
            - The slipbox is an external system to think in [[ExoMind]]
            - Simplicity is powerful. Idea don't need to come from complicated origins or workflows
                - For example the conveyor belt idea is simple: instead of bringing the worker to the car, move the car towards the worker. This was a revolutionary idea. Just like the container idea. 
        - ### **Chapter 1.3 The Slipbox Manual**
            - One idea per note, in the case of roam one idea per block or probably per Zettel (which likely becomes a page)
            - Write notes thinking of what is already existing and how to connect them
            - Write in full sentences, with explicit reference to literature and to other notes 
            - Not copy but write in your own words, trying to maintain the original context and meaning as truthful and close as possible to the original
            - Link with other thoughts and notes - **this step is very important **
            - Through links between notes, a notes appears and belongs and makes sense in different contexts
            - A simple and reliable external structure to think in, that compensates for the limitations of our brain, an [[ExoMind]] #Thinking
            - 
            - now for example
            - "do I want to high;light that **Everybody writes. Especially in academia. Students write and professors write**." And nonfiction writers, who are the third group of people this book is aiming to help, obviously write as well. And writing doesn’t necessarily mean papers, articles or books, but everyday, basic writing. We write when we need to remember something, be it an idea, a quote or the outcome of a study. We write when we want to organise our thoughts and when we want to exchange ideas with others. Students write when they take an exam, but the first thing they do to prepare even for an oral examination is to grab pen and paper. We write down not only those things we fear we won’t remember otherwise, but also the very things we try to memorise. Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note. [*](((hG7TRPF5I)))
