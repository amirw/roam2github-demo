        - how to integrate zettelkasten and spaced repetition?
        - for non-academics, what are some helpful insights to help for their given field?
    - Interview with Sonke
        - people are being experimentlal and customizing their personal zettlekasten approach
        - notion of complex vs linear - too many books take 1 concept and apply it to everything - that is over reductive thinking 
        - then the need for software that does Zettelkasten
            - ideas have their time - same idea pops up in different places
        - if we don't take notes - we are floating on new ideas new ideas are not necessarily the best. The moment where you have to make a decision about 2 different notes - I thought this was the same idea - but it isn't.  the moment you have to write something down, the brain has to take over - A DIALOG PARTNER
        - write down or type?  writing is better
        - Roam Research removes friction
        - radical flexibility
        - Stages
            - fleeting notes
            - literature notes
        - begin with the end in mind - THINK ABOUT HOW YOU WILL USE YOUR NOTES
        - How he uses [[Roam]]
            - in Roam he takes longer notes - b/c block level refs
            - notes as densley connected - note sequences? granularity?
            - hashtag - one word - and is a table of contents or index or collection pages - allows you to jump to a big page with a bunch of references
    - Phased Reading
        - fleeting notes
        - and then go through
        - use block references - make comments
        - then make zettels -or permanent notes
    - check out '(rand)"
    - [[Goals of Book Club]]
        - Develop a system to turn knowledge into wisdom more effectively.
            - The more interconnected my knowledge is, the more likely it is to become behavior-changing wisdom
            - regimented
                - implicit in this systems or process thinking is the necessity of a regimented set of actions
                - the process itself can be flexible, but in order to see the benefits, certain behaviors must be set and followed - There must be a system!
                - what are these core behaviors?
                    - read in kindle
                    - highlight in kindle
                    - sync [[ReadWise]] with Roam Research
                    - return to the highlights pages in Roam
                    - translate the most important concepts into permanent notes
    - from [[@Beau Haan]]
        - Fleeting Notes = Seeds 
Literature Notes = Digging into the soil
Permanent Notes = Roots of the trees
[[Branching Notes]] = Trees in the forest
Folgezettel = Entangled roots, connecting each tree
Zettelkasten = The forest

The goal = a forest that grows from the core of who we are!
