- Session 3
    - "Pick from the prompts below and write in your own page for 15 minutes."
        - "Reflect on the book.  What are you impressions? "
            - I found it took some commit to reading this book. Although it is a book and topic I am interested in learning more about, I found it intense looking through every detail to understand it thoroughly.
            - The breakdown between processing literature vs expression of ideas regarding them was an aspect of the system I found particularly interesting
        - "Reflect on literature notes- useful? Did they help you understand the book in a different way? "
        - "Reflect on the work and timeline- has it been easy/hard to get through the phases so far? "
        - "How is your progress towards your initial goals? Or have they changed?"
        - "Explore the concept of permanent notes/zettels."
            - "Explain what a permanent note is in your own words?"
            - "What is holding you back from creating zettels?"
            - "What are you unsure about? "
        - "Do you have any questions for [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]]?"
- 
- What determines the state of a Zettel - Goals and motivation behind reading literature notes can have a direct effect on this.
