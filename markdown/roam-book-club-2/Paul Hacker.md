    - [[Goals]]
        - I would like to see myself becoming more likely to use notetaking as a way of interacting with all the work I am doing, without it being like a real drag.

        - To use the writing and reading as a kickstarter to doing more writing and reading more consistently
        - Will this be something I can easily teach others, like Joel and Marisa
        - Will this help me remember thinks more readily and be able to find info that I want to remember?
        - Can this be used in coaching others about PC?
        - Will this speed up, slow down, help or harm my ability to get to a stage where I feel comfortable moving PCPC online?
