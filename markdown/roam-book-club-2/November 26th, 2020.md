1) Watching [[Nikki Huang]] be surprised as she started to write her first `Zettel` thinking, this has got to be harder than this... my response, if you did the `Fleeting` and `Literature` notes right, it should be effortless~

2) Wow! That was magical, mind-blowing, and inspiring! Thank you [[Carolina Brum]] for allowing me to experience that with you! Your first `Zettel`!!!

- #Chat [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] Is anybody out there routinely used ^^spaced repetition^^ within Roam? Would there be any interest in having a quick demo at our next Zoom meetup? #[[spaced repetition]] #consolidation - maybe a quick #Poll (please see below)

    - (... important note - spaced repetition is NOT synonymous with "spaced flashcards", although many people have used it that way.)
        - "This might also be one of the problems with [[flashcard]] [[spaced repetition]] approach to learning, which trains you to recall information upon exposure to very specific {{alias:[[cue]]cues}} (e.g. a keyword, a cloze passage). But because the cues themselves are isolated and not connected to other thoughts or concepts, you never end up building the [[latticework]] of concepts you need to easily recall and make sense of the field as a whole. Building a lattice is the process of [[elaboration]] [*](((AQEyeuXh9))) which allows you many entry points or routes to any given atomic unit of information you might be trying to recall, whereas the flashcard system only gives you a limited number of entry points. [*](((fqbzgEa19))) #Reflection "
    - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] while this is more commentary - the closest spaced repetition occurs to me is rather informal and unpredictable. I usually let platforms like Roam help me rediscover notes I haven‚Äôt visited in a long time whether it‚Äôs looking at ‚ÄúAll Page‚Äù or searching for a block (or creating a new page) and happening to see something related, or unlinked references. it‚Äôs been a rediscovery process that helps buffer information overload (esp due to multiple contexts or levels of thinking). I‚Äôm open to new ideas and in the past, any kind of method that has tried to ‚Äúforce‚Äù its way into my flow has never worked. I‚Äôd rather just flow with whatever information that is in my view knowing I have structures like a slipbox to reenforce what I really care about.
        - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] I hear you loud and clear! 

"Minimum forcing" is a key principle for me. My own implementation of SRS is definitely based on that. 

I agree 100%, that Roam already functions as a kind of "serendipity-driven spaced repetition system", in its own right. This is quite powerful, in its own right, and is a native strength of the Roam work-environment. 

I'd also wager there's some value in setting it up so it throws you a "curve ball" every once in a while - something that you were not actively looking for, or a link that happens to be in a part of your graph you haven't visited in a while.

I've found that a handful of "minimum-forcing" structures end up keeping topics on my radar in a way that is unobtrusive and doesn't require much in the way of maintenance or upkeep. 
            - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]]I agree with the criticisms of standard SRS that you and Ahrens are making, though I continue to use SuperMemo as well as two other SRS apps specifically for Spanish. Only this week I learned about the difference between cued recall ("What is retrieval practice?") and free recall ("Tell me everything you know about Melville's __Moby Dick__"). The latter has much better learning outcomes than the former.

The problem is that free recall doesn't feel good, because it heightens one's awareness of how badly one did. It feels a lot better to reread the notes, though doing that does not help learning much at all.

I have been trying to think of ways to use Roam for free recall. I have my sources tagged reference, generally, and as book, article, podcast and video, specifically. So, perhaps each day I could do a search for refences with a date sort. Then go to an old reference, try to recall as much as I can (free recall), then record the date in the reference so it will show as newly updated for the next day's practice.

I am quite convinced by the retrieval practice literature, so I would love to hear ideas on how to implement it.
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] I had a breakout with [[Lloyd Williams]] today and he invited me to read one of his posts and it dawned on me the one place [[spaced repetition]] is critical is reviewing one‚Äôs projects and accountabilities (eg. a [[GTD]] weekly review).  I think what I resist the most is I don‚Äôt necessarily think it has to happen like clockwork (eg. every Sunday) and having a structure like in your demo today to decide, in this moment, how much time you want to push forward the next review sounds really useful in building the habit!
    - #Reply-from [[Andy Henson]] I'm interested in the wider application of ‚àÜ as a way of programming your attention - I wrote about some of the use-cases I've experimented with https://elaptics.co.uk/journal/roam-research-programmable-attention/
        - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] whoa!  this is totally next level - thanks for sharing!  I had on my todo list to figure out what the hell ‚àÜ did and I know i‚Äôve selected it not knowing I was pushing items forward to the next day!  This is very serendipitous given it dawned on me that a flexible form of spaced repetition sounds like a good thing for relearning the habit of a regular (intentionally not saying weekly!) project review (more context in thread above)

- #Chat [[Chinarut]] whoa - time really flew when you are in flow state!  I had an amazing coaching session today and Beau was an awesome reminder to stay focused on your goal/purpose for Zettlekasten - this is what‚Äôs going to give our Zettles some juice and not have 1000 different rehashes of the book.
    - key takeaway here: "Coaching Session summary with [[Beau Haan üìå]]"
    - I‚Äôve been inquiring into what a group Zettlekasten around the domain of wellbeing might look like and find it really fascinating to see what happens when you jump back-and-forth between domains. I decided to ‚Äúback zettel‚Äù and this felt relevant to what we are discovering together in book club!
        - "#Zettels [[A slipbox is a network of conversations. A collective slipbox is a network of individuals and their notes. All individuals make a unique contribution to a collective dialogue. Every time we add an individual to a group slipbox, we expand the richness of interconnected concepts and abstractions inspiring new possibilities for the collective]] z28/1a"
- 
- #Chat [[Beau Haan üìå]] As I'm resting in between these sessions, I'm reminded of the most important aspects of [[Zettelkasten]]
    - As the `Zettels` build to a place where, in the beginning when everything is easily seen and accounted for, once a threshold is crossed there has to be a way to still be able to retrieve those permanent notes
        - We have to buttress our trust in this way of practical note-taking by making sure that it can withstand 100, 200, and even 1000 `Zettels`
    - This is where `Index` notes are useful. Or another way of putting it, entry ways in which you can enter into your [[Zettelkasten]]
        - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] agreed! I‚Äôm actually on my 4th iteration of my slipbox. I started by attempting to group Zettel together using hierarchy and this got messy fast. Then I tried to use block referencing to link Zettels together and it was equally as messy. Then I realized the digital medium allows us to be rather abundant indexing Zettels. My understanding is our goal is to identify clusters of Zettels which becomes the substance for a linear argument. I‚Äôm starting to see a cluster of Zettels around [[collective action]] :)
        - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] - Chinarut, I love that observation - that after a while we start to see the "weak links" between larger groupings of thought and before we know it, new communities-of-Zettels have emerged. 

It's kind of remarkable how that works over time.
        - 
    - The power of this idea-generating machine's ability to link `Relevant` notes is important, since that's where the magic of dialogue actually happens
        - Imagine courting a beautiful mate, and as the thread of conversation bounces from one topic to the next, you want to always know where you are, as you traverse down these branches of thought
    - The conversation starts, continues, and branches down new threads of thought between the crafted `Zettels` that have been __informed__ by the non-linear process of creating `Fleeting` and `Literature` notes~
        - Which only makes sense, since we want to argue, support, and dispute our most highest order of statements--in order to be maximally fulfilled by this conversation partner
            - Who wants to have arguments with those that are ill-informed 
üó£üö´ Fleeting Notes 
            - Who wants to fight a straw-man
