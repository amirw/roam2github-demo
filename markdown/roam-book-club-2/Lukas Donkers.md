- [[Questions for Sönke]]

    - What has made you switch to Roam, and what did you use previously?

    - Should you take notes in your own words, or copy highlights (quotes)?

    - "Questions for us from [[Sönke Ahrens]]"
        - "What have you learnt about note taking that I (Sönke) should know about?"
            - There is a lot of power in simplicity. Simplicity makes a system easy and enjoyable to use, thereby reducing friction and allowing you to do more
                - For this reason, it makes total sense to adapt and change your system to fit your needs. Apply meta reasoning and make the system work for you.
        - "Are there any additions to the process described in the book?"
            - I personally adopted a 'voice notes' stage instead of a 'literature notes' stage:
                - First, I read and highlight passages I find interesting
                - Second, I go for a 30 minute walk and record my thoughts.
                    - I apply Free Recall to see what I remembered, but I also 'ramble' and connect what I read with other things
                - Third, the next day, I listen to my voice notes and turn them into permanent notes
                    - Doing it the next day allows me to be more selective in what I find important.
        - "Discuss your impression of the range of possibilities and limitations of a Zettelkasten?"
            - I'm not yet convinced that 'page title contains a statement or claim' is the best way to go
                - Personally, I think in subjects, and on a subject page I have 'subtopics' or 'related topics'
                    - And under those I might have claims
                - The process of zettling seems very narrow: for better or for worse, I'm not sure
        - "(what use cases does it work for? Are there any examples it doesn't work for?)"
            - If I applied zettelkasten, I would not apply it to projects.
            - For me, projects move too quickly for me to ponder questions for too long
                - And in many cases, this is a good thing: "when in doubt, build it and see if it works"
            - I should note that my projects are distinctly different from academia. I am a programmer, after all!
    - "General review questions "
        - "Reflect on your impressions of the book "
        - "Reflect on your note taking and reading. What if anything, has changed?"
            - I am now more aware of the importance of permanent notes. Previously I would rarely write them, hoping that Roam would surface interesting notes instead.
                - By being more intentional about them, I end up writing a lot more
        - "Do you plan to continue your Zettelkasten from here?  "
