- [[Book Club Live Session 1]]
    - Goals (alas, all was lost at this point!)
        - Learn Roam not so much to be an expert but to be familiar enough with it that it becomes natural enough to use as a habit.
        - Force some time to study a single topic.

    - "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?"
        - The discipline to return to things already read and written, and work them, when there are so many more interesting and new things to read and write about. It's easy to believe that the first pass was enough and that the brain can be trusted to apply a natural prioritisation to the stuff already read. If it was relevant or significant, the memory ought to get triggered again when reading something new and related. If not, it will die a natural death of obscurity. Very, very efficient! But is it inferior? A local minima?
        - Having something to write in at all times. Reading in bed vs reading in the car vs reading in the study vs reading on the lounge vs reading at work. Being able to capture literature notes in the same place from all those places is tricky. Maybe literature notes aren't supposed to made from bed! But I gotta get my reading done when I can. My time is not my own.
    - "Define a literature note in your own words."
        - From "How to Write Good Notes", I recall there are three types of notes: fleeting, permanent and project. I think literature notes were one of two permanent notes. The first type are references (explicit quotes referenced to sources). The second are literature notes, which are the result of re-reading your fleeting notes and creating prose, complete with references and quotes. So that if they were going to be used in a manuscript they could just about be lifted out and used without further editing.
    - "I am dumber than the collective knowledge in this room. I'm in the right room!"

- Fleeting Notes:: 
    - Chapter 2.1: Make fleeting notes. I now know what a fleeting note is, so am keen to go back to the start of the book and make them!
    - Introduction
        - Everybody writes, lots, but mostly *notes*! So why all this attention on essays and prose and articles and books? Given that "every intellectual endeavour starts with a note", shouldn't we be compelled to up our note game?
        - Sure, our output would improve if only we had more self-control and self-discipline. But environment has a bigger impact and more lasting impact than willpower. "Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn't one around".
        - If what you want to do is what you should be doing, then you don't need willpower. So if even your procrastination was productive, you'd always be productive.
            - Reminds me of an old philosophy I feel in love with and eventually forgot: "productive procrastination". If you procrastinate by cleaning, or fidget by riding a bike, or day dream and take notes afterwards, then you'll feel less guilty about procrastinating and it will contribute to your productivity. Not that every moment should be productive, but if you set your life up so you make use of inevitable procrastination, then even your down time becomes more effective.
        - Conclusion: put some attention on your note taking game, and unlock everything that follows.
    - Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know
        - This is short and sweet and easy to digest!
        - "The best students ... struggle the most." because they aim high.
            - "Good students ... peek over the fences of their own disciplines".
                - Classic generalist philosophy. See how others view your work - how can I make my output someone else's best input?
        - "Taking smart notes is as simple as it gets."
        - Two ideas:
            - Slip-box
                - 1960s, German public servant, Niklas Luhmann. Side-passion was reading. Took lots of notes, but then decided to get serious about his note taking.
                    - All notes on little numbered slips of paper, collected in the slip-box.
                    - Entered academia, became very prolific. Wrote "The Society of Society" in 30 years, just as planned.
                    - Others studied his productivity and identified the slip-box and "I only do what is easy." "If I falter ... I do something else". That is, the system was so attractive, it made productivity almost effortless.
                - Whenever he read something, he'd write a card with notes and a reference to the text on the other side, and put it in the bibliographic slip-box.
                    - He'd then review those notes and add new ideas that arose to new notes, one idea at a time, and put them in the main slip-box.
                    - The prose was brief, but complete and thoughtful - close to what would appear in the final manuscript.
                    - Connections and context were important. The ideas were processed - observations and insights, not just quotes.
                    - The trick is that the notes were not organised by topic, but by an arbitrary index. The organisation of individual notes was dynamic - every new note was an opportunity to find connections with existing notes.
                - Finally, there was an index, to provide entry points into a line of thought or topic.
                - That's it. And now we have software to do all this.
            - Routine
                - "10 mind-blowing tricks to improve your productivity" never help.
        - References David Allens' Getting Things Done.
            - Put all tasks in one place and process them, so you don't get distracted by competing thoughts.
            - But writing is not linear task based. It's creative. There's no way to know before you start where you'll go.
                - The "tasks" are either too small and trivial, or too grand to be a step.
    - Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do
        - Funny capitalisation.
        - Underlying premise: if every step in creating output is easy, then creating output is easy. That comes down to the inputs - good inputs make each step easy. And that starts with good notes.
        - Back up to Chapter 2.1!
        - Make fleeting notes:
            - Always have something to make notes with. Capture every idea. Mere reminders of what is in your head.
        - Make literature notes:
            - "Whenever you read something, make notes about the content"
            - Capture what you don't want to forget. Short, selective, own words (avoid quotes).
        - Make permanent notes
            - Now the slip-box.
            - Once a day before you forgot what the notes meant.
            - Once established, the slip-box will guide you to what's important.
            - Develop ideas, rather than collect them.
            - One note for one idea, as if someone else was reading them.
        - Now fleeting notes get binned, literature notes get filed.
            - Permanent notes go in the slip-box, filled with related notes.
            - Update index to help find note.
        - Review slip-box to develop topics, raise questions.
            - Read more, take more notes, challenge, strengthen, change.
            - Take the interesting path that promises the most insight.
            - Do not brainstorm for topics - check the slip-box.
            - Interests will change, but that's what insight brings.
        - Now pick a topic based on what you have.
            - You already have all the notes to write about it. Copy them to your "desktop" and organise them.
            - Go back to reading and note-taking to improve.
        - Turn the notes in a rough draft.
            - Edit the draft, and pat yourself on the shoulder.
        - Of course, it's never one paper at a time. But that's where the system shines.
            - The notes live on. So take the time to make them. Be flexible.
    - Chapter 3. Everything You Need to Have
        - Don't complicate unnecessarily - otherwise every little step turns into a project.
        - Undistracted brain + storage = all we need
        - Pen + paper at all times for fleeting notes.
        - "Zotero" for references?
        - Pen + paper for slip-box!
            - or Lüdecke's Zettelkasten
    - Chapter 5:
        - Writing is taught as distinct skill to demonstrate knowledge. But good writing = good learning.
        - And writing is the only destination for knowledge, so writing is important.
        - "You will improve your reading, thinking and other intellectual skills just by doing everything as if nothing counts other than writing"
    - Chapter 6.
        - Don't be like early ship owners packing containers.
        - The most immediate solution may not be the best for the system.
        - Storing notes under topics = storing purchases by date/store.
        - Slip-box shows you notes you've forgotten
            - other systems just show you what you were looking for.
        - 3 types of notes
            - fleeting, permanent, project.
        - Goal: more notes = better!
        - Only take fleeting notes if you will review within a day.
    - Chapter 7.
        - Not possible to pick a topic without writing first.
        - A slip-box means never starting from scratch.
        - The brain is an unreliable source of ideas. Caution: "brainstorm"
    - Chapter 8.
        - Exergonic/endorgonic work.
        - External rewards shortcut = no loop.
        - Turning literature notes into permanent notes is a short feedback loop on your own learning.
    - Chapter 9. Separate the Interlocking Tasks
        - 9.1 Give Each Task Your Undivided Attention:
9.2 Multitasking is not a good idea
9.3 Give Each Task the Right Kind of Attention
            - Focus! Multitasking is a trap
            - "We tend to confuse familiarity with skill"
            - Each task requires its own focus.
            - "Not a work of professionalism to master one technique and stick to it no matter what"
            - Alternate between intense focus and playful exploration.
        - 9.4 Become an Expert Instead of a Planner
            - "Exclusive use of analytic rationality tends to impede further improvement in human performance because of analytic rationality's slow reasoning and its emphasis on rules, principles and universal solutions. Second, bodily involvement, speed and an intimate knowledge of concrete cases in the form of good examples is a prerequisite for trie expertise."
            - "The widespread praise for planning rests on the misconception that a process like writing an academic text, which is highly dependent on cognition and thinking, can rely on conscious decision-making alone."
            - Bicycling can only be learned from doing. Yet many study guides want to spare you from experience by telling you what to do.
                - Paramedic beginners, experts and teachers observed CPR being performed. Beginners picked the experts 50/50, experts picked them 90%, but teachers only 30%. The experts tended to be rule breakers or reacted in unexpected ways based on their intuition.
        - 9.5 Get Closure
            - Only leave a few unanswered question in your mind. The rumination can be useful, except when it's not.
        - 9.6 Reduce the Number of Decisions
            - "ego depletion" - running out of volition puff.
            - Useful to be able to take breaks without losing our thread.
    - Chapter 10: Read for Understanding
        - 10.1 Read With a Pen in Hand
            - 
- "Pick from the prompts below and write in your own page for 15 minutes."
    - "Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month. "
        - Very new process for me. Reading has always been a leisure activity - something I would do when I'm away from my computer or notebook. Unlike people who read for a profession, reading is generally something I only plan to do while in bed or out camping or at the farm or something. So fundamentally this is a different mindset.
        - Of course, I read at work too, but it's always things that are immediately applicable (eg. specifications in a datasheet or code examples) so I apply the results immediately (or copy them into my notes) and move on. No elaboration necessary, so it feels like I'm missing out!
        - So I've taken to reading on the train - at least then I have my iPad and can take notes side-by-side. As crummy a computing experience as it is, at least I'm not tempting to do "real work".
        - It's a very slow way to read and requires care, but I have Sonke's words resonating in the back of my mind "if you're not going to take the time to create permanent notes from your fleeting notes, then there is no point taking the fleeting notes in the first place"! Ouch... even the fleeting notes are an arduous step up.
        - Perhaps there's a deep seated learning habit in me - I always found the act of note taking to be very effective way to study. Reviewing the notes afterwards never seemed so effective. I'd just move on to more content/testing, and the fact that I'd made the notes meant that I could recall the relevant parts and apply it to the new content.
