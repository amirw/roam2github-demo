    - As the directory inevitably gets crowded, it can quickly be searched by using the "filter" icon at top right.
    - ^^QUICK TIP^^: It's tempting to nest your personal details here, but even better is to nest them under a bullet labelled [[Directory]] under your home page.
        - if you do that, we'll all see them in linked references, which can be filtered and sorted.

        - Notes from [[SÃ¶nke Ahrens]]
            - [[Questions for SÃ¶nke]] How do you feel about being the Patron Saint of Roam? Conor was inspired by it, Roamans have read your book, this community sees you as a visionary.
            - [[Questions for SÃ¶nke]] What inspired you to write the book originally, beyond the history of zettelkasten?
            - Origin: __thinking about thinking. __
                - How to systematically represent heterogeneous thoughts.
                - But the book got little attention: dismissed as the musings of an old professor sitting in his room.
                - My brain cannot hold too many ideas at the same time -- so a spin off personally and professionally. Had tried:
                    - Paper
                    - HTML
                    - Other apps
                - The moment when we have to make a decision between two nodes we wrote at different times. With a tool like Roam: is it an addition, contradiction, or something else? **A dialog partner**
                    - This helps make things fit, be more humble, contrast with confirmation bias.
                - I'd originally conceived this for academics or professional non-fiction writers. I now see this has much broader applicability. Coders have a natural connection for how to store information, but it's applicable to other disciplines.
                - Paper or software? Both. As long as the app doesn't steal your focus onto the software. Roam doesn't get in the way of your thinking. Removes friction.
                - Patron Saint of Roam: I get the benefit that what I wrote has helped people. I developed a theory, but was not able to create a context for it. I wasn't really interested in the academic community itself, but the ability to create an idea with broader audience is enormously encouraging.
                - How should we read the book?
                    - Do you want to put it into practice? Might not need to take many notes, rather, think about __how__ to put it into practice. Not create a paper you want to write, but practicum. But if you want to develop your own theories and concepts, then write notes.
                - Note sequences are important. One note asserts something. The next note might say "In contradiction to the previous note..." **Dialog between notes.** 
                - There are "index" or collection pages: collective. Others might be standalone notes. The magic of "block references."
                - SÃ¶nke on individual vs collective Zettling: You need a **firewall** as you get familiar with your own Zettelkasten and that canâ€™t happen in a collective process; but what kind of experiences do you have when there is so much possible, when you do something collectively that is impossible when you do it on your own?
        - [[Goals for Book Club]]
            - Read book on different levels: Big Ideas, Concepts, Insights
            - Super-heterodyne with other participants on various applications of the learning -- what can I learn from others?
            - Use methodology of book to create notes about book
            - What are the lessons and limitations of only academic application of this methodology?
    - [[Book Club Live Session 4]]
        - #Zettels Zettels are Atomic ideas for future use. Zettle: distillation. Meta-level. Core idea to be mixed or matched with other ideas, well-referenced. An extension of literature notes. = #[[Evergreen Notes]] According to [[Andy Matuschak]] https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Evergreen_notes
    - [[Book Club Live Session 5]]
        - "Reflect on your own reading and writing practice and habits with this book over the last month. "
            - I've found that the book starts slowly and encouragingly. I haven't gotten all the way through the book.
            - Neverthless, I'm committed to completing it and adopting the methodology.
        - "Reflect on your Zettel process"
            - Many people have praised [[Beau Haan]] for helping them. Perhaps it's time for me to set up a 1-on-1 coaching session with him.
            - The #[[Fleeting Notes]] was easy enough, a simple reminder
            - The #[[Literature Note]] was not tough, it was a paraphrase in my own language.
            - The #[[Zettelkasten]] note is more difficult: is a #Zettel the same as an #[[Evergreen Note]] or how does it differ?

    - [[Questions for SÃ¶nke]] Would love to hear more about collective Zettling. I'm hung up on the concept that thought groups that grow organically within the [[zettelkasten]] are because of what interests me. So how does that integrate with others? I can see the benefits of seeing things from a different perspective, just don't understand the pragmatics of it.

    - "Everybody writes. Especially in academia. Students write and professors write. And nonfiction writers, who are the third group of people this book is aiming to help, obviously write as well. And writing doesnâ€™t necessarily mean papers, articles or books, but everyday, basic writing. We write when we need to remember something, be it an idea, a quote or the outcome of a study. We write when we want to organise our thoughts and when we want to exchange ideas with others. Students write when they take an exam, but the first thing they do to prepare even for an oral examination is to grab pen and paper. We write down not only those things we fear we wonâ€™t remember otherwise, but also the very things we try to memorise. Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note."
        - [[Joey Harris]] Everyone writes and all serious thinking begins with a note.
