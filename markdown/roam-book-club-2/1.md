- **Introduction**
- [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
    - Chapter Summary::
        - This chapter introduces the importance of note taking, making the contrast between note taking and planning, which is more common yet ineffective learning and writing technique. 
        - The idea of a Zettelkasten (German for Slip-Box) is introduced as a powerful methodology for note taking.  
    - Literature Notes::
        - [[Writing techniques]] are usually taught without much regard to over-arching workflow [*](((59-bYYcu-)))
            - This book aims to change that. 
        - This book will present a structure for [[Note-taking]].  
        - Having structure in your note taking is important: 
            - Allows you to move seamlessly from one task to another, and not force yourself to do work you brain isn't ready for [*](((59-bYYcu-)))
            - Relieves the burden of keeping track of everything in your head.  [*](((N9B8GYzJr)))
            - Structure provides a process to break down an amorphous writing task like 'writing a paper' into manageable tasks [*](((N9B8GYzJr)))
            - Good structure enables flow state [*](((N9B8GYzJr)))
            - One of the most revered and productive sociologists of the 20th century relied on a similar structure to be prolific [*](((59-bYYcu-)))
            - Structure helps beat procrastination and motivation [*](((lz_jy3Uyg)))
        - Having a structure is different from making plans
            - Plans require willpower, which is unreliable  [*](((e5t8EGtoY)))
            - Plans suggest a known outcome, but creating novel writing is by design to search for insight. 
                - "How do you plan for insight, which by definition, cannot be anticipated" [*](((e5t8EGtoY))) 
        - The challenge is to structure one's workflow in a way that insight and new ideas can become the diving forces that push us forward.  [*](((e5t8EGtoY)))
        - Universities turn students into planners, which is limiting. 
            - Plans allow you to get through exams. 
            - Planners are unlikely to continue their studies after their exams 
        - Experts are different
            - Would not consider voluntarily giving up what has already proved rewarding and fun [*](((Afolfm8fD)))
        - Good students
            - Look for help with their writing [*](((GRlg3daPc)))
            - Wrestle with sentences [*](((GRlg3daPc)))
            - Spend more time in the library [*](((GRlg3daPc)))
            - Look beyond the obvious [*](((GgF6t07Z4)))
            - Constantly raise the bar [*](((Y0L49bjII)))
            - Likely to suffer from imposter syndrome [*](((Y0L49bjII)))
        - Poor students
            - Stick within the boundaries of their discipline [*](((LTX79DEgy)))
            - No serious external system [*](((LTX79DEgy)))
            - Stick with usual prosaic formulas and templates [*](((LTX79DEgy)))
            - Lack insight into their limitations consistent with the Dunning-Kruger effect [*](((LTX79DEgy)))
            - Find confirming evidence because they are unwilling to explore further via skill or interest to find disconfirming facts and arguments [*](((LTX79DEgy)))
        - 1.1 Good Solutions are Simple – and Unexpected::
            - There is no need for a complex system, or complete reorganization. Start working and developing notes immediately [*](((axkSbVLUr)))
            - Complexity will be an issue. 
                - You will have to deal with an increasingly complex body of content, especially because it is not just about collecting thoughts, but about making connections and sparking new ideas.
            - Most people try and reduce complexity, but often attempts become complicated and fail [*](((FfwvQnsGs)))
                - Trying to seperate what they have into smaller stacks. 
                - Trying to sort into topics and subtopics 
                - Plus, it reduces the likelihood of building and finding surprising connections between the notes themselves, which means a trade-off between its usability and usefulness
            - The best way to deal with complexity is to keep things as simple as possible and to follow a few basic principles. The simplicity of the structure allows complexity to build up where we want it: on the content level. [*](((vhg4vhrk2)))
                - Which has empirical support [*](((vhg4vhrk2)))
            - Create a simple system
                - A simple system will mean there's no preparation time and you can start easily. [*](((LLzV2bQ35)))
                - You don't need to reinvent the wheel. There's already a system that's been created called the slip box.  [*](((hCx2F3Siv)))
            - A system is more than software tools 
                - Daily routines are just important as the tools 
                    - ["Even the best tool will not improve your productivity considerably if you don’t change your daily routines the tool is embedded in, just as the fastest car won’t help you much if you don’t have proper roads to drive it on"](((ez0DqkFlC)))
                - Routines require simple, repeatable tasks that can become automatic and fit together seamlessly [*](((ez0DqkFlC)))
                - GTD is an example of the importance of an overarching workflow 
                    - Collect everything in one place 
                    - Process it in a standardized way
                    - Only once everything taken care of can we focus on what is infront of us 
                    - Having a workflow allows you to reach flow state, "Mind like water"
                - GTD cannot be transferred to the task of insightful writing. [*](((PxFYE_wSD)))
                    - GTD requires defined objectives, whereas writing is exploration
                        - Writing needs to be organised in a useful manner
                    - Writing isn't linear. Writing is jumping around. [*](((uROSshEwO)))
                        - GTD never caught on in academia. 
                - But we can take from GTD that an important insight is that we must adopt a holistic perspective. 
                    - [When it comes to writing, everything is connected. ](((wAz831-X5)))
                        - Reading, writing, researching, all must be linked to seamlessly move from one to the other. 
                - We need a note taking system as comprehensive as GTD, but one suitable for writing. The system is the Slip-Box.  [*](((8abwn6Aeu)))
        - 1.2 The Slip-box::
            - Where does the concept of the Slip Box Come from? 
                - Created by [[Niklas Luhmann]] in Germany in 1960s 
                    - Luhmann was a public servant, but pursued his interest in sociology, philosophy and organizational theory. 
                    - He was a passionate reader, and developed a system for reading [*](((ym487mPvZ))) [*](((tr6Squ5vc)))
                - Luhmann recognised that random note taking was pointless 
                    - He began with marginalia, writing notes in the margin of books, but then his system became more sophisticated when he realised his note taking wasn't leading anywhere.[*](((r6KEY5ijJ)))
                        - "Just amassing notes in one place would not lead to anything other than a mass of notes." [*](((BjFRHwXXy)))
                    - Built the Zettelkasten with a focus on making connection between his notes
                    - He realised that the notes he was writing were not only valuable in the context (or book) that they generated, but instead, that they relate and contribute to different contexts. [*](((BjFRHwXXy)))
                    - "So he turned note-taking on its head. Instead of adding notes to existing categories or the respective texts, he wrote them all on small pieces of paper, put a number in the corner and collected them in one place: the slip-box."  [*](((r6KEY5ijJ)))
            - How did Luhmann use the the Slip Box? 
                - The Slip Box became a dialogue partner, and he used it to generate ideas, develop and structure thoughts. [*](((BjFRHwXXy)))
            - Using the Slip Box was key to Luhmann's prolific academic career
                - Luhmann became prolific publishing 58 books and hundreds of articles in a 30 year academic career. [*](((mCWzSPAwU)))
                    - Luhmann entered academia after he had created his Slip Box system, and the benefits of it became clear. He was incredibly productive, relative to others and the standards of the time. He completed his PhD thesis in less than a year while also taking sociology classes. [*](((coCtGuX4a)))
                        - He created the ambitious 30 year research plan of creating a theory of society. [*](((msXA6B9IH)))
                - Another sociologist "Johannes F.K. Schmidt concluded his productivity could only be explained by his unique working technique (Schmidt 2013, 168)." [*](((AFd1gnBPS)))
            - Paradoxically, Luhmann achieved this prolific output academic output in an effortless (stress free?) way 
                - Luhmann achieved this output with no real effort. “I only do what is easy. I only write when I immediately know how to do it. If I falter for a moment, I put the matter aside and do something else.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 154f.)" [*](((j6EyoD7pi)))
                - It seems strange as we are use to the idea that "great output requires great effort" [*](((7HSDsXHqL)))
            - The Slip Box allowed Luhmann able to be both prolific, as well as not particularly stressed or overwhelmed by his own publishing cadence. 
                - His writing process was flexible to allow him to respond to new insights and directions as they occurred. [*](((oz882t9yv)))
                - He was able to make the most of switching. Because of his system, he was able to switch between projects and ideas as a source of productivity, rather than as a cost. [*](((hhTaHBEnz)))
            - The rare achievements of Luhmann demonstrates the value of a Slip Box.
                - To achieve a similar creative output as Luhmann, you also require a external writing and note taking system, and this note taking system is more important than IQ. 
            - Luhmann's system demonstrates that an effective system for note taking and writing practice is more important than IQ score 
                - "Sure, you need to be smart to be successful in academia and writing, but if you don’t have an external system to think in and organise your thoughts, ideas and collected facts, or have no idea how to embed it in your overarching daily routines, the disadvantage is so enormous that it just can’t be compensated by a high IQ." [*](((_4c4iQ4E2)))
            - So if the value of Luhmann's system is clear, why isn't everyone using a slip box? 
                1. Only recently have we understood the detail of Luhmann's system.  
                    - Previous analysis of Luhmann's process placed too much emphasis on the  slip box in isolation rather than Luhmann's workflow with it. [*](((j85ILtzRh)))
                2. Previously description of Luhmann's method was written in German for a specific sociologist audience, precluding it from the wider world.[*](((j85ILtzRh)))
                3. Most people don't expect much from simple ideas. [*](((j85ILtzRh)))
                    - Luhmann's system was simple, and sometimes simple ideas are dismissed as unimportant. Another example is that of Henry Ford who had a revolutionary idea in mass production, but used simple ideas to create this idea, such as a conveyor belt [*](((lMo5zp36O)))
        - 1.3 The slip-box manual::
            - What was Luhman's [[slip-box]]? 
                - A note taking process using index cards stored in two wooden boxes. Luhmann would read sources, and create notes on index cards and add them to his slip box.  
                    - Box 1- Index cards containing bibilographical references [*](((nN5f1vjN_)))
                        - Side 1- Metadata/bibliographic info
                            - Bibliographic information of source material 
                                - (author, date, source location- similar to metadata in Roam). 
                            - An ID number generated manually Luhmann
                        - Side 2- A brief summary of the idea from the reference
                    - Box 2- Index cards containing Ideas, comments, thoughts [*](((fDWyGkGQL))) [*](((55MjPqvfQ)))
                        - Synthesized ideas and arguments, generative writing
                            - Notes are brief enough to be contained on a single card
                            - Written sequences of IDs of other index cards in the slip box that are related 
            - Principles for how Luhmann would write notes
                - Writing topics would emerge inductively from index cards over time.  [*](((zt7lrN7X2)))
                    - Extend existing themes in the slip box
                    - Avoids the blank page problem. Start by collecting evidence, and then write with the evidence. 
                - Always be making connection between notes
                    - Luhmann linked between his notes using his numbering system. 
                        - Reference chains emerged that gave dense connection between index cards.  It meant cards in the slip box would rarely exist in isolation
                        - Roam means you don't need to write numbers manually anymore. [*](((XdGixKkuK)))
                - Write ideas into his own words. [*](((iKecBcypp)))
                    - Write brief, full sentence notes, in your own words
                        - Write in the final style of the manuscript or output
                        - Keep the meaning and intent of the citation, but write in your own words.
                - Write the note to fit the context /argument in the slip box [*](((iKecBcypp)))
                    - Translate the ideas of the source to the context in the slip box
                        - Don't just add external information to the slip box. 
                        - The note is not a summary of the source, it's an addition to Luhmann's ideas
            - What did Luhmann avoid doing when taking notes? 
                - Avoid simply copying ideas or quotes from the text. 
            - How is the Slip Box organised with respect to topic? 
                - The slip box was organised by connection, rather than topic.
                    - When adding a new note, Luhmann would check how the new note would __connect__ to other existing notes. [*](((U4Q7m4mQO)))
                    - It meant he was able to use a new note multiple times, by making different connections to different existing notes. [*](((LAHvoWGna))) [*](((k1R5hvOJl)))
                    - Searching for and making connection was an important part of his process. 
            - Is the expression of a 'personal wikipedia' a good analogy for zettelkasten? 
                - No. There are subtle differences between the concept of hyperlinks, wikipedia and zettelkasten which make this a bad analogy [*](((LAHvoWGna)))
            - The final section is an index [*](((gq3S3MuUq)))
                - This would include one or two notes that would represent an entry point into a line of thought. 
                    - Notes with a sorted collection of links are, of course, good entry points. 
            - Why do we need a slip box? 
                - Because it extends the capacities of our brains. It is reliable in a way that our memory, and our ability to recall facts from our memory at particular times, isn't. 
            - Summarise Luhmann's slip box process 
                - Reading a source 
                - Create a index card for it in "Box 1- Index cards containing bibilographical references [*](((nN5f1vjN_)))"
                    - Summarise the idea in your own words
                - Make connections-  find ways it relates to existing notes "Written sequences of IDs of other index cards in the slip box that are related "
                - Extend existing ideas or write new ideas in "Box 2- Index cards containing Ideas, comments, thoughts [*](((fDWyGkGQL))) [*](((55MjPqvfQ)))"

- [[Chapter 2. Everything You Need to Do]]::
    - An effective zettelkasten system changes the task of writing. 
        - It eliminates the blank page problem. 
        - It transforms writing from arduous endeavour, to one of curiousity, playfulness, looking for connections rather than on the hunt for new information. [*](((gG5gSVgXN))) 
    - An effective zettelksten transforms each stage of the writing process. 
        - Starting a new project never begins with a blank page. You begin instead with a set of Ideas, references, passages of relevant material, descriptive headings, all available before you begin. [*](((pAECpc8Gl)))
        - Finishing a project is also easier. It still requires editing, but the task of advancing a draft is easier as you have access to references, quotes and ideas. [*](((X7Ji9CUKq)))[*](((pAECpc8Gl)))
    - To write is to think.  
        - The main work of writing is thinking. And the best creator of thinking is writing. [*](((RN5JKBqxJ)))
            - “Notes on paper, or on a computer screen [...] do not make contemporary physics or other kinds of intellectual endeavour easier, they make it possible,” neuroscientist Neil Levy concludes in the introduction to the Oxford Handbook of Neuroethics, summarizing decades of research.
            - Richard Feynman and Ben Franklin advocate for writing as the source of thinking.  
        - If we are writing anyway, better notes during the process offer a great leap forward in thinking effectiveness and efficiency.

            - Voice memos, quick capture, note book. 
        - Make literature notes. [*](((eRojO1adJ)))
            - When reading something, write notes about the content.  
            - Keep it short. 
            - Be eselective. 
            - Keep these notes together with the bibliographic details.  
        - Make permanent notes. [*](((y5dDNqTm7)))
            - Go through your notes once a day before you forget what they said
            - The idea is not to collect but develop ideas, arguments and discussions. 
            - Does the new information add to, contradict, correct, support or add to what you have already done.  
            - Look to combine ideas to generate something new 
            - Process and structure of permanent notes [*](((DC7zUzXbl)))
                - Write one note for each idea, and write it for someone else
                - Full setnences, precise, clear brief. 
                - Throw away your fleeting notes. And put literature notes into your reference system.  
                - All that matters is your permanent notes.
            - 
        - Add permanent notes to your slip-box [*](((nQY-Lsqjm)))
            - File each note behind one or more related notes
                - can put it more more related notes if you use software. With paper have to select one location.
            - Look for connection between notes.  Luhmann would then add the note ID so the links would be rediscoverable later.
            - 
        - Develop topics and research projects bottom up from within the system. [*](((erCjnBgLf)))
            - See what is there, what is missing and what questions arise. 
            - Extend themes by reading more and adding to things. 
            - Over time look into the slip-box to see where chains of notes have developed. 
            - The more interesting something is to you, the more you will read and think about it.
        - This process will eventually provide enough to write on a particular topic. 
            -  Try to write early on topics to see if you have enough ideas
        - Create a rough draft
            - Translate your notes and ideas into a manuscript
            - Detect holes in your argument
        - Edit and proofread your manuscript
        - Reflections on the steps
            - These steps are for a single paper, more likely will have multiple papers in different stages of development [*](((20T97LXDY)))
            - Likely reading new material will often relate to multiple different ideas in your slip box.  Will constantly encounter interesting ideas in the search for specific topic ideas. Being flexible helps. [*](((HYujK1QLt)))
                - Add them to the slip box as you go, rather than disregard. The goal is to get the slip box to a critical mass 
            - On any given day will be engaged in multiple of these steps [*](((JyB58IMPZ)))
            - How focussed your reading is depends on your personal preference. Reading broadly will often help create serendipity with notes. [*](((EegQ1h74c))) Great ideas often aren't anticipated [*](((6mdYRieSi)))

        - There should be no friction in using a tool.  
            - Many try out tools without really mastering them, and don't get to point where they reliable use them 
            - Many people know what a flute is and how it works, can even pick it up and mess around, but few have mastered it as a skillset 
            -  
        - Tools should be always at the ready
    - Put time into organising how you use your tools, and slip box. [*](((yIlbxuFst)))
        - The road to hell is paved with good intentions. 
            - Don't make your slip box a graveyard for thoughts
            - Luhmann's slip-box is the focus on a [long term research project](http://www.uni-bielefeld.de/soz/luhmann-archiv) which describes his method in greater detail

- **The Four Underlying Principles**
- [[Chapter 5. Writing is the Only Thing That Matters]]
    - Writing is what matters. 
    - Writing __should be__ the medium of learning
        - Studying best viewed as form of research, research is best viewed as a form of writing. This is missing from traditional education
        - In traditional education, writing is used to test understanding through exams and assignments [*](((rfxlhKub4)))
        - Under these conditions, advice on the writing process treats it as a seperate task to thinking. Writing is presented as a skill that is utilised only when you have to produce a written artefact such as assignment. 
            - In this context, writing is presented as a linear process, with a beginning point, and a clear final outcome with a written artefact.  
                - The linear process of writing [*](((tRZ3544fl)))
                    1. Find a topic 
                    2. Find a problem 
                    3. Find and collect the relevant literature 
                    4. Read the material
                    5. Process it to come to a conclusion
                - Almost all books on academic writing are written from this perspective
        - However, this view of writing as a testing procedure or artefact creating method, misrepresents how important writing is to the process of learning.  
            - School does not help individuals explore learning paths. Instead it is about compliance to a particular path or set of facts. [*](((U0_AKhDHt))) [*](((5Bxb_J2dj)))
        - Creating independent researcher is a better model for how to build good thinkers. 
            - Independent researchers utilise writing not as tool of artefact creation, but as a primary tool of thought. 
    - Writing is the medium of research and knowledge creation
        - Research is the process of presenting an argument. Written argumentation is the most common and powerful form of argumentation in science. [*](((5Bxb_J2dj))) [*](((U0_AKhDHt)))
        - Science is the process of exchange, contestation of argument. 
            -  There is no such thing as a history of unwritten ideas.
            - If the argument is not presented to others, then it is not research
                - Private knowledge is not knowledge in academia. [*](((5Bxb_J2dj)))
            - If a fact cannot be reproduced, then it is not a fact [*](((5Bxb_J2dj))) [*](((U0_AKhDHt)))
    -  Why is writing the best medium of argumentation? 
        - If we take the criteria for a convincing argument as [*](((U0_AKhDHt)))
            - Is the argument coherent 
            - is the argument based on facts 
        - Then writing is a powerful tool to achieve both. Writing helps improve coherence, helps present factual evidence. 
        - Writing is so powerful that is not just a vehicle for how ideas are presented after the work is done. It is the work itself. An researcher does not only rely on writing to present ideas, a researcher relies on writing to produce ideas:
            - The presentation and the production of knowledge cannot be separated, but are rather two sides of the same coin (Peters and Schäfer 2006, 9) [*](((U0_AKhDHt)))
    - This makes clear the motive to focus on writing as if nothing else matters
    - This linear process of writing is an idolised representation of the writing process. It is a representation of the process for studying, rather than independent research. 
    - But, this focus on writing doesn't mean less of other tasks.
        - Attending lectures is one of hte best ways to get an idea of current research
        - Asking questions, discussion is also important 
    - An argument can be presented in different forms- written, verbal, recorded. 
    - What it means is that writing should not be seen as a seperate isolated task. Don't compartmentalise writing. Making use of writing, in these contexts.  [*](((pbn4HW864)))
    - But  
    - See note taking as a technique, and worthy of deliberate practice [*](((9LdD6VzxA))) 
    - "If you change your mind about the importance of writing, you will also change your mind about everything else." [*](((9LdD6VzxA)))

- [[Chapter 6. Simplicity is Paramount]]
    - Revolutionary ideas can be deceptively simple [*](((Zo2Uaa6y3)))
        - #Example #analogy Freight shipping containers. In 1956 Malcolm McLean transformed global trade as a result of a simple idea of standardized shipping containers. 
            - The idea was not unfamiliar to existing shipping merchants. 
            - But they had failed to implement it as they attempted to adapt their existing systems.
            - McLean looked beyond rational reasons why the idea would fail, and created an entirely new system for the new idea, which turned it into a success.
            - Extended description
                - Malcom McLean in 1956 converter a shipping tanker 'Ideal X' to carry 58 shipping containers. Created a standard size shipping container. 
                    - No clue his idea would "tip the world in a new direction"
                - Previous to this, ships carried cargo in a storage room, with stevedores optimally arranging and fitting the goods. [*](((cfebc0ULz)))
                - Most ship owners had considered the idea of putting things in boxes but had not pursued it [*](((cfebc0ULz))). 
                    - "Why would anyone what to try and fit square boxes into a round-shaped ship body"
                    - "Ship owners also didn’t have many customers who wanted to ship exactly the amount that fit into a container."
                    - "Containers half empty or filled with goods from different customers, which meant that you had to unpack and rearrange the containers to untangle different orders in every single harbour"
                    - "Once unloaded and sent off on trucks, you had to find a way to get them back. McLean lost hundreds of containers this way. It was a logistical nightmare." 
                - McLean wasn't alone though. There were other ship merchants that tried it. But, of those that did pursue it, many failed and lost money [*](((9-l2gA_P8)))
                - Why did other ship builders fail? 
                    - The ship builders "tried to benefit from the obvious simplicity of loading containers onto ships without letting go of what they were used to." [*](((9eRcB8Tey)))
                    - "The perception was shaped by what had worked before, and only immediate effects were visible." 
                - McLean understood something different: [*](((9eRcB8Tey)))
                    - "it is not the perspective of the ship-owners that counts, but the purpose of the whole trade: to bring goods from the producer to the final destination. Only after aligning every single part of the delivery chain, from packaging to delivery, from the design of the ships to the design of the harbours, was the full potential of the container unleashed."
                - Once the advantages become obvious, it created a flywheel effect, that brought further advantages. [*](((ziZQ-Jtg0)))
                - 
        - Many students think like early ship builders, in that they don't design a system for their notes that helps them later. 
            - Marginalia, highlighting all do little to help later
            - Writing becomes a task of memory, which is faulty [*](((iEoGjCKxY)))
        - If someone does take notes, the question becomes- Under which topic do I store this note?  [*](((qjApgS0oM)))
            - Most students sort by topic, by semester, or seminar which do not help for rediscovery later. 
        - The slip-box is the shipping container of the academic world [*](((EVjA9eABJ)))
            - It provides a standardized format. 
            - It limits uncertainty, indecision of 'where do I store this' 
            - It doesn't focus "on the in between steps and trying to make a science out of underlining systems, reading techniques or excerpt writing, everything is streamlined towards one thing only: insight that can be published."[*](((EVjA9eABJ)))
            - It is not designed by topic [*](((EVjA9eABJ)))
            - The simplicity of the system is that it grows more valuable, as opposed to becoming confusing 
                - #reflection Did Luhnmann's first version of his slipbox look the same as his later ones?
            - The bibliographic box is designed to help you find things you deliberately search for 
            - The second box is design to present you ideas to consider. 
            -  
        - The slip-box can lose it's value when things are added indiscriminately
        - It gains strength when we reach a critical mass which is a function of quality of notes and quantity [*](((j2y4NdvQj)))
    - Different types of notes [*](((qWUhCUP19)))
        - Fleeting Notes [*](((BL5wHnXDF)))
            - Reminders of information. No structure, informal.
        - Permanent Notes [*](((SWKiDesb1)))
            - Written in a "permanently understandable" way. Filed systematically, rigorously.  
        - Project Notes [*](((yBtPTbb0b)))
            - Relevant to one project. 
                - Kept within a specific folder and discarded after the project is finished.  
        - Only if the notes are kept seperate will it be possible to build up a critical mass [*](((7_jHUj4nP)))
            - #reflection Should I keep my permanent notes in a seperate Roam graph? I generally think it's important to have it all in one place. But, is there any merit to having a seperate graph? Just use tags, filters? 
    - Common mistakes of taking notes and slip-box attempts
        -  Write everything down and not process them, to treat all ideas as permanent notes, not throw away any idea. [*](((7_jHUj4nP)))
            - Advantages- always capture interesting things
            - Disadvantages- Without filtering from fleeting to permanant note, and instead treating every idea as a permanent note, notes never build up a critical mass. 
                - Good ideas are diluted through too much noise 
                - Similarly chronology only helpful for comparisons and considering sequence, doesn't help discovery [*](((7GWVsCHA5)))
        - Only collecting notes related to specific projects [*](((HlsQj7ZDO)))
            - Useful for the project
            - But a disadvantage when the project is over, and have to start again.  
                - In the process of creating notes for a project, don't disregard notes on related adjacent ideas
            - The goal is to create a "permanent reservoir of ideas"  [*](((HlsQj7ZDO)))
        - Treat all your notes as fleeting notes [*](((V8bEn02_W)))
            - Easy to spot from the mess that comes with it
            - Or the growing pile of notes, followed by the urge to clean up
            - Even small amounts of unclear and unrelated notes will induce the feeling of starting from scratch
    - All of these mistakes are made clear in volume of notes
        - A frail system will be revealed in volume of notes
            - More notes will make it difficult to retrieve ideas, surface ideas, etc
            - A reliable system will instead increase the playfulness, opportunities for serendipity as it grows
    - What is the purpose of different types of notes
        - Fleeting notes [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
            - Capturing ideas quickly 
                - Either in flow of your own ideas
                    - Or remembering sentences read or heard that pique interest 
            - "Fleeting notes will become completely useless unless you do something with them" [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
                - "If you already know you will not go back to them, don't take fleeting notes" [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
        - Fleeting literature notes [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
            - Useful if you need an extra step to graph an idea
            - Still won't help in later stages of writing 
            - Reminders of thought, which you haven't had the time to elaborate on yet
        - Project notes [*](((6oFK0OY_C)))
            - Kept in a project specific folder. 
            - Can include: 
                - Collections of literature related to project 
                - outlines 
                - reminders 
                - drafts
            - #reflection Is this a set of project specific tags? 
        - Permanent notes [*](((wmFEVrD5o)))
            - Written in a way that even if you forgot the original context, you would still be able to make sense of them
    - Hard to distinguish your good ideas in real time [*](((BRp1QJSON)))
        - Most ideas age badly, even if they feel important at time of creation
        - Others can become important with time, even if they felt unimportant at time of creation
        - 
    - What notes should be stored in the slip-box
        - Literature notes in bibliographic slip-box
        - Permanent notes in the ideas slip-box 
    - How did Luhmann take notes? 
        - Luhmann never highlighted or wrote comments in the margin [*](((sA3wOx9on)))
            - Stuck to his system of writing bibliographic details
            - And then would review these and add them to his slip box ideas
        - Nothing would ever get thrown away.  
            - Some notes he would note revisit, but nothing was removed [*](((sA3wOx9on)))
    - What does the standardized format allow? 
        - The standardized format of the note is the key facilitator  
        - Allows for scale. As scale is achieve it doesn't create mess, it creates a critical mass. 
        - The fate of your notes is nothing to worry about. Themes of the slip-box will emerge inductively [*](((UZ4XCHfSA)))
            - Creating structure to your notes on the way in should mean that you only ever have to master the everyday process of writing and structuring new notes.
                -  Once they are entered, don't need to think again about structure.  The scoreboard takes care of itself feeling.  
        - Creates more opportunities for recombination [*](((XVevLqYUv)))
    - Zettelkasten and reference systems have in built function of project specific desktops. [*](((jLXwfvQda))) [*](((cpTQ863Il)))
        - This way it doesn't interfere with slip-box 
    - The work of processing notes, is the important work of note taking, and this is different from reading. 
    - "When you close the folder for your current project in the evening and nothing is left on your desk other than pen and paper, you know that you have achieved a clear separation between fleeting, permanent and project-related notes."
    - Review questions
        - How important is standardization of note structure? 
        - What is the difference between a zettelkasten and a slip-box? 
- [[Chapter 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch]]
    - The blank page problem exists because how to write is misunderstood [*](((pA_EX_Gzu)))
    - Popular writing advice describes writing as a linear process. [*](((s2br3-pds))) [*](((kvk3dCa8w)))
        - The linear process
            1. Start with selecting a topic 
            2. Then plan to do research 
            3. Complete the research 
            4. Complete the writing
        - Versions of this can also highlight the role of brainstorming as a first step
            - {{mermaid}}
                - graph LR
                    - Brainstorm-->Plan-->Research-->Write
        - Consequences of this view
            - You are required to preconceive a topic to write about, before you have immersed yourself in it, without knowing much about it.[*](((kvk3dCa8w)))
            - You are relying what is top of mind, as what you pick from to set a direction.
        - Argument against this view
            - Linear writing process neglects that that the work of writing is best done long prior to when a writing piece is required 
                -  #example #analogy "These study guides, which neglect everything before a writing assignment is given, are a little bit like financial advisors who discuss how 65-year-olds can save for retirement. At this point you would be better off curbing your enthusiasm (which is exactly what one of the most often sold study guides in Germany recommends: first, lower your expectations on quality and insight).[ 16]"
            - Brainstorming is a process which relies on what's already in your head [*](((ww64gf_vE)))
            - Deciding on a topic before knowing much about it, is the cause of many common frustrations of writing including procrastination and being stuck [*](((SQRXUZCcv)))
            - People rely on linear decsriptions because proper note taking technique is rarely taught
            - Existing advice promotes thinking about what to write, independent too, or prior to, actual writing, which is detrimental. [*](((ww64gf_vE)))
            - Concessions in these guides also often acknowledge that the writing process doesn't follow this linear path strictly
    - The slip-box as an alternative model 
        - An accumulative or accretive process of note taking 
            - Based on a daily routine or practice of note taking
        - The slip-box model
            1. Start with reading what you find interesting. 
                - Hermeneutic circle [*](((kvk3dCa8w)))
            2. Take reliable notes 
            3. Accumulate insight and evidence and material to combine gradually
        - Consequences of this view
            - If you have done the work of note taking prior to writing, the writing process changes to become enjoyable [*](((F-jhYj-Pz)))
            - You never start a project from scratch again. The blank page never exists again. 
                - You start with your previous notes. Equivalent of compound interest.
            - Your topic emerges from your previous interest. It is neither ill informed or preconceived[*](((F-jhYj-Pz)))
                - Instead of spending time looking for a question, you will spend it looking for what exists in your notes
            - More enjoyable- Reduces friction, arguments will emerge from your accumulative reading without force [*](((2U8Id9Bu8)))
    - Writing may not be linear, but it's not ad hoc either. 
        - Rigour and technique in note taking is important. 
- [[Chapter 8. Let the Work Carry You Forward]]
    - A good notetaking workflow generates energy, becomes a virtuous circle [*](((NcwnhsymJ)))
        - #analogy Similar to exergonic and endergonic reaction [*](((RK0T2uHBh)))
    - A bad notetaking workflow takes energy, becomes unsustainable, breaks down
    - The goal of a notetaking system is that it should generate energy over the long term. 
        - The system itself must generate energy not take energy. If it doesn't and we need to rely on motivation or short term interventions it can become very fragile [*](((RQQ2w8HSU)))
    - How do you create a note taking system that generates energy? 
        -  Create satisfying, repeatable experiences to create virtuous cycles
            - #example Michelle Segar, fitness motivation coach uses this dynamic to transform people's exercise habits
                - Her mode is: Creating satisfying, repeatable experiences with sports.[*](((ZLooaikXs)))
            - #reflection How do we create satisfying, repeatable note taking experiences? [*](((fxNScV0CM)))
            - #question What does this mean though?  What does satisfying repeatable note taking? 
                - What is repeatable? 
                - What is satisfying? 
        - Build feedback into the system 
            - Feedback loops are important to motivation as well as learning. Getting better at something is the ultimate motivator. 
                - Feedback is critical to improvement. 
        - The importance of feedback-  #question- How does this relate to the slip-box? What's the feedback mechanism? it's just our own review of our own notes? 
            - Growth mindset is a key way to improve
                - How receptive people are to feedback is a strong indicator of long term success.  
                    - Carol Dwek describes this as having a growth mindset [*](((AR7OaXAvj)))
                    - Those that avoid feedback don't improve
                    - Growth mindset means taking pleasure out of change as opposed to individual point of performance
                    - Fear of failure creates resistance to change [*](((AR7OaXAvj)))
                        - Fear of failure is phobia- Kakorrhaphiophobia 
            - A learning system must deliver practical feedback in a timely feedback 
                - A growth mindset though, is only one half of the process. The other half is having a learning system in place that creates practical feedback delivered in a timely way  [*](((fAEc5q4n4)))
                    - Feedback doesn't help if it's delivered too late [*](((fAEc5q4n4)))
            - Timely feedback is important for creating system that allows opportunity to correct mistakes [*](((LoKPUYPOR)))
    - Principles of note-taking #draft Need a better title for this 
        - The fundamental technique of writing is thinking. If you aren't writing in your own words, you aren't thinking. [*](((oO7Kd61Qe)))
        - Reading is about discernment, choice. Selecting what's important from what you read is the critical skill, as opposed to reading more [*](((oO7Kd61Qe)))
        - The task of writing #[[permanent notes]] in your own words is a test of your understanding of the concept [*](((Xy_6Gvicd)))
    - The state of your slip-box reveals the state of your knowledge [*](((MHzKOP6xZ)))
        - It can reveal errors
            - Writing [[permanent notes]] in the slip-box is also a process of trial and error, which reveals contradictions, inconsistencies or repetitions in your thoughts [*](((Xy_6Gvicd))) [*](((XNIhRfrZU)))
                - #[[literature notes]] #Definition of literature note, and the importance of writing notes in your own words
                    - Reading with a pen in the hand, for example, forces, us to think about what we read and check upon our understanding. It is the simplest test: We tend to think we understand what we read–until we try to rewrite it in our own words. By doing this, we not only get a better sense of our ability to understand, but also increase our ability to clearly and concisely express our understanding–which in return helps to grasp ideas more quickly. If we try to fool ourselves here and write down incomprehensible words, we will detect it in the next step when we try to turn our literature notes into permanent notes and try to connect them with others. 
        - It can create connections
            - The slip box surfaces potential connections that you otherwise wouldn't see
                - The slip box is not just a collection of notes. It's a serendipity and recombination engine. It will bring forward ideas and connections we wouldn't have thought if not for the slip-box [*](((U0D-8ZKaX)))
        - It mirrors how our brains work
            -  This reflects how our brains work. Making connection is the key to thought, and hang together. The more we learn, the more we have available to us for new connections, as we create a "“latticework of mental models” (Munger, 1994). [*](((E6qEFWAIg)))
    - The slip-box alone won't do your thinking. Thinking without a slipbox is limited too.  It is using both- the relationship between our slip-box and our brain which make possible more and better insights [*](((MHzKOP6xZ)))
        - What am I getting stuck on? 
            - I think I like the expression fundamental competency 
            - What's an alternative to that
- **The Six Steps to Successful Writing**
- [[Chapter 9. Separate the Interlocking Tasks]]
    - 9.1 Give Each Task Your Undivided Attention::
        - Interruptions and distractions are becoming more frequent and more enticing. [*](((bXWICxkpS))) 
            - Things are being designed for shorter attention 
                - TV soundbites decreasing in time of last several decades
                - Watching TV reduces attention span of children
        - #question Is this still corrrect- These sources are pretty old now. Perhaps look up to check any further detail.
        - Interruptions and distractions are detrimental to thinking [*](((bXWICxkpS)))
            - Interruptions decrease productivity by 40%.  
                - Emails hurt IQ by 10 points 
    - 9.2 Multitasking is not a good idea::
        - Multitasking, completing two or more different tasks simultaneously, is often described as a positive productivity method. [*](((r_KY4vkpO)))
            - It's promoted as a way to cope in modern information rich environment
            - Common to describe younger generations as better at it 
            - Those that promote value of multitasking also promote being good at it 
        - However, experiments run on self reported multitaskers showed multitasking decreased their productivity [*](((kjkr6_EwW)))
            - Both the quantity achieved, as well as quality achieved reduced
        - The experiments show that multitasking not only reduces our performance on a second task, but more potently, reduces our effectiveness on all tasks we are trying to complete simultaneously.  [*](((5BAP8kMCx)))
            - The consequences are that if we are multitasking, we might not ever be getting better at a task, regardless of how long we are doing it. [*](((5BAP8kMCx)))
        - Multitasking in reality is not focussing on two or more tasks simultaneously. Instead, it is quickly shifting between multiple tasks [*](((5BAP8kMCx)))
            - Every shift drains energy, comes with switching costs 
        - Why do people think that multitasking is a positive to their performance, even  if the evidence is clear that it doesn't work? 
            1. Often those that promote multitasking never test their productivity rigorously, particularly against a control [*](((AmpFHNteC)))
            2. The exposure effect. Doing something many times makes us believe we are getting better at it, independent of our performance [*](((AmpFHNteC)))
        - Recognise the limitations of multitasking is useful when thinking about the task of writing. [*](((6oI9uHcXb)))
        - The act of writing contains many different types of tasks, requiring different types of attention. 
            - Reading
            - Highlighting 
            - Sense making 
            - Making connections 
            - Structuring 
            - Reviewing and editing 
            - Formatting
        - Multitasking is hard enough if we are attempting different tasks, but made even harder if the type of work also requires different types of focus. [*](((sw97t7ucj)))
        - Flow state is conditions when being highly focussed also becomes effortless [*](((d0FZTHICy)))
        - A hard task such as writing requires focussed attention. 
            - Focussed attention has not been aided by new tools, and the duration we can achieve hasn't changed over time. [*](((UHcHGWMNj)))
            - 
        - Distractions short circuit focussed attention. [*](((UHcHGWMNj)))
        - We can train ourselves to focus more [*](((FUZKBnN4G))) 
            - Avoid multitasking
            - Removing distractions
            - Separate out the types of tasks required so they do not interfere with each other 
        - Focussing more is not only a mindset design problem, it is also a workflow design problem [*](((FUZKBnN4G)))
            - Not having an effective system or structure make the task of focussing more difficult or increase potential to fail  
    - 9.3 Give Each Task the Right Kind of Attention::
        - Writing, when considered closely, contains many different types of tasks with differing types of attention [*](((wG9XnpzPM))) [*](((O9niuj_yu)))
            - e.g. Reading is different to writing a first draft, is different to editing, is different to proofreading [*](((O9niuj_yu)))
            - "Reading"
            - "Highlighting "
            - "Sense making "
            - "Making connections "
            - "Structuring "
            - "Reviewing and editing "
            - "Formatting"
        - Attempting to do multiple types of writing at once is detrimental, and it's important instead to focus on one at a time. [*](((O9niuj_yu)))
            - To not worry about structure at same time as generating words and sentences [*](((XzhfUwUyZ)))
            - To attempt the task of outlining as different from writing sentences [*](((VJrKLYhnV)))
            - To not be a critic at the same time as author of first draft [*](((AsWzUgNdr))), 
            - Proofreading, formulating outlining, also different from combining and developing thoughts at a first draft stage [*](((2rMHeYddi)))
            - Reading too is different from writing. [*](((CbV1WlBG_)))
                - Reading a task that itself also has different modes [*](((CbV1WlBG_)))
                    - Inspectional reading 
                    - Skimming
                    - highlighting 
                    - Close reading 
                    - Reference checking 
        - It's detrimental to attempt to be doing multiple types of thinking and work at once, and theres a need to section off different modes. The task requires a spectrum of different focus. 
        - The work requires different types of attention [*](((sT8GoIPxY)))
        - Historically understood types of concentration to differ according to type of work. 
            - Scientific work was seen as a task requiring dedication and attention [*](((sT8GoIPxY)))
            - Whereas creative work as playful and creative [*](((sT8GoIPxY)))
        - However, today recognise that all types of work require different types of concentration at different times. [*](((sT8GoIPxY)))
            - Scientific work requires creativity playfulness as much as art requires dedicated focus [*](((sT8GoIPxY)))
        - The study of daily workflows of Nobel Prize winners and eminent scientists highlights [[flexible focus]]  “Specifically, the problem-solving behavior of eminent scientists can alternate between extraordinary levels of focus on specific concepts and playful exploration of ideas. This suggests that successful problem solving may be a function of flexible strategy application in relation to task demands.” (Vartanian 2009, 57) [*](((sT8GoIPxY)))
        - The need to for both exploration style thinking, and dedicated exacting style thinking resolves a puzzle on creativity in psychological research. [*](((gi5RZ6hZa)))
            - "The key to creativity is being able to switch between a wide-open, playful mind and a narrow analytical frame.” (Dean, 2013, 152) [*](((gi5RZ6hZa)))
        - #reflection A lot of this book as not been about note taking. It feels as though it's the psychology of concentration and writing task management
        - Psychologists however, has not proposed a workflow that allows us to be both playful at the right time, as well as focussed at another time. The task is how to build a system which reliably allows both? [*](((496ZpCm0r)))
    - 9.4 Become an Expert Instead of a Planner::
        - To be an expert you need bodily involvement, intimate knowledge of concrete cases and good examples [*](((uxvFkKm81)))
        - Making plans doesn't make you an expert in the task. Practice in the task makes you an expert in the task. [*](((5dE8cfQGo)))
        - To become good at generating insight and writing good texts, you must practice both. [*](((5dE8cfQGo)))
        - Academic writing is a process that relies on technique, and one which we can get better at through practice alone. But we must learn through doing rather than plans. [*](((n7EHntVBl)))
        - Experts have virtuosity which comes from their embodied experience [*](((Qqnfjqznp)))
            - To have a feel for a task, acquired intuition
            - Particularly important when the task is complex or dynamic 
        -  To become an expert you must generate your own mistakes in order to learn, rather than learning from description or the prescriptive plans on how to think and what to write [*](((L4uNlWqv8)))
        - An experiment demonstrated that trainers of CPR paramedics were unable to distinguish beginners from experienced paramedics in sample scenes [*](((bsG3p8Xuj))) [*](((iocGPKjU0)))
            - The trainers assessed the paramedics against the ideal rules, but the best paramedics made the best decision in the circumstance they faced [*](((kBKacUmpA)))
            - Teachers tend confuse the ability to follow rules, with the ability to make decisions [*](((80ZPGOcMz)))
        - The goal of academia is gaining insight and making it public [*](((L4uNlWqv8)))
        - Experts don't consult the rules first in making decisions. They have internalised the rules, to have advanced instincts, enough experience to have intuition for a context. Their advanced decision making capacity becomes gut instinct [*](((_OQvZf-JV)))
        - Trainees present at first as knowledgeable because they can present a close representation of the rules, but are bad at making decisions in context [*](((kBKacUmpA)))
        - Gut instinct is not a magical force, or an impulsive risky decision, but instead, the preference of experience [*](((aheSsHde_)))
            - Experienced chess players appear to think less than beginners. But they see patterns from their previous experience [*](((aheSsHde_)))
        - But gut instinct, is honed by systematic exposure to feedback loops and experience [*](((nijGB1zC-)))
        - "The workflow around the slip-box is not a prescription that tells you what to do at what stage of writing. On the contrary: It gives you a structure of clearly separable tasks, which can be completed within reasonable time and provides you with instant feedback through interconnected writing tasks. It allows you to become better by giving you the opportunity for deliberate practice. The more experience you gain, the more you will be able to rely on your intuition to tell you what to do next. Instead of taking you “from intuition to professional writing strategies”, as the title of a typical study guide promises, it is here all about becoming a professional by acquiring the skills and experience to judge situations correctly and intuitively so you can chuck misleading study guides for good. Real experts, Flyvbjerg writes unambiguously, don’t make plans (Flyvbjerg 2001, 19). [*](((nijGB1zC-))) #[[Roam Book Club Principles]]
    - 9.5 Get Closure::
        - Our short term memory is limited. We can hold a maximum of 5 +/-2 things in our head at any given time.  We need a system to augment our memory. [*](((xyY0jdDXR)))
            - Even memory artists hit limts, and find ways around links through chunking [*](((ELskC18g4)))
                - E.g. remembering a string of numbers by chunking or by pattern. Like world cup years. [*](((HCE3a3ASc)))
                - Algorithm of thought (remember a string of numbers) e.g. as olympic or world cup years beginning with 1988 [*](((x1fwVSi7R))) [*](((HCE3a3ASc)))
        - Our memory doesn't work like formatted computer memory. It's not retrievable or not. it's nebulous, in there somewhere, until it's used or forgotten [*](((8b6ETKKZJ)))
        - It's much easier to remember things we understand, as they are connected to patterns we know, and this is what building a slip box is all about [*](((3u90h1h1x)))
        - **These are the questions we should ask of zettels?**
            - "#quote ^^Every step is accompanied by questions like: How does this fact fit into my idea of …? How can this phenomenon be explained by that theory? Are these two ideas contradictory or do they complement each other? Isn’t this argument similar to that one? Haven’t I heard this before? And above all: What does x mean for y? These questions not only increase our understanding, but facilitate learning as well. Once we make a meaningful connection to an idea or fact, it is difficult not to remember it when we think about what it is connected with.^^"
        - We want to remember as much as possible but not use up memory on idle information [*](((kpqpW49Yr)))
        - Zeigarnik effect [*](((GcyHK_4RN)))
            - Open tasks tend to occupy our short-term memory- until they are done. 
                - A waiter could remember everyone on the table's order correctly by memory, but 5 minutes later outside the restaraunt didn't recognise the person he served [*](((GcyHK_4RN)))
            - But that's not entirely the case either. Zeigarnik's follow up research describes that 
    - 9.6 Reduce the Number of Decisions::
        - The limited resources for writing/concentration? [*](((mi4CJq3rH)))
            - Attention
            - Memory
            - Willpower
        - Environmental design can determine willpower [*](((mi4CJq3rH)))
        - Historically, willpower seen as a trait rather than trainable skill, but now seen as trainable [*](((IsHsEHJwf)))
        - A negative system can impact willpower, lead to ego depletion
            - [[Ego Depletion]] A temporary reduction in capacity or willingness to engage in volitional action caused by prior exercise of volition" [*](((IsHsEHJwf)))
                - Ego depletion can be causes by many things: [*](((kKau7CeqI)))
                    - Acts of self control 
                    - responsible decision making 
                    - active choice
                    - Being a victim of prejudice [*](((-cJsUWWZX)))
                - Reliability of claims have been questioned [*](((GA_-GRwmF)))
                - #question Similar to decision fatigue? 
        - A positive system for our writing, the way in which we organise research and writing, can significantly reduce the amount of decisions we have to make. [*](((gdS3acyLy)))
            - Always using the same notebook
            - Always extracting the main ideas from a text the same way
            - Always turning them into the same kind of permanent note
            - 
        - Leaves us more mental energy for the difficult tasks of writing and solving problems [*](((gdS3acyLy)))
        - A reliable system allows you to switch contexts, and it be a positive aid to productivity, rather than leading to switching costs [*](((LhfTAVsR5)))
            - Can give brain time to process things, background sensemaking [*](((LhfTAVsR5)))

- [[Chapter 10: Read for Understanding]]
    - Ben Franklin was a note taker
        - "“I would advise you to read with a pen in your hand and enter in a little book short hints of what you feel that is common or that may be useful; for this will be the best method of imprinting such portcullis in your memory.”–Benjamin Franklin[ 26]"
    - 10.1 Read With a Pen in Hand::
        - A final written artefact is an outcome an accumulation process. 
            - Slip box-> rearrange your notes-> continuous text -> good draft -> final paper
            -  #reflection
                - Earlier argued against linear model. But arguing for it here, just different form? 
        -  If your literature notes are written in your own words, then you will automatically be transforming the findings of others into something new and distinct of your own ready for future use. [*](((1rvdqVUPF)))
        - The quantity and quality of your writing is dependent on the state of your slip-box. 
            - The notes in your slip-box develop arguments [*](((1rvdqVUPF)))
            - The notes in your slip-box surprises with new arguments [*](((1rvdqVUPF)))
            - "The richer your slip box, the richer your thinking" [*](((1rvdqVUPF)))
        - The goal is to achieve a critical mass of of interconnected ideas. [*](((1rvdqVUPF)))
        - If your slip-box is in order, writing becomes a task of making connections, a dialogue between you and the slip-box. [*](((AxDsPAbRN)))
            - Notes are already abstracted from the original source
        - The importance of extraction and translating context. Bringing things into the slip box in a way that optimises writing later. The goal of the slip box is not to be a summary of the text that goes into it. It is to write for the context of later remixing. [*](((G5ZXHLRTw)))
        - #Slip-box [[structure]] 
            - Literature notes are stored in the reference system with bibliographic notes. 
            - The ideas box is seperate, saved for looking for lines of inquiry and possible connections
            - While the literature notes will be stored within the reference system together with the bibliographic details, separate from the slip-box, but still close to the context of the original text, they are already written with an eye towards the lines of thoughts within the slip-box. #quote ^^Luhmann describes this step as follows: “I always have a slip of paper at hand, on which I note down the ideas of certain pages. On the backside I write down the bibliographic details. After finishing the book I go through my notes and think how these notes might be relevant for already written notes in the slip-box. It means that I always read with an eye towards possible connections in the slip-box.” (Luhmann et al., 1987, 150)^^ [*](((7kgUv6PAe)))
        - Literature notes
            - Characteristics of literature notes [*](((IiLT5pu2L)))
                - How extensive literature notes should be depends on the original text, and what you need them for [*](((7_-tgj41Q)))
                    - Elaborate notes make sense in challenging cases [*](((7_-tgj41Q)))
                        - Whenever we are exploring a new domain or unfamiliar subject for example
                    - Perhaps based on enjoyment too? [*](((7_-tgj41Q)))
                    - For easier cases keep them simple [*](((7_-tgj41Q)))
                    - Our latticework of mental models helps us make sense of the text [*](((7_-tgj41Q)))
                    - Write them out by hand can help, but regardless, the importance is processing them [*](((66Orx12hV)))
            - Common errors [*](((IiLT5pu2L)))
                - Most students do not take good literature notes. Either too systematic or not systematic enough
                - Most students rely on recommended reading techniques like SQ3R or SQ4R which are ineffective 
                - The treat the text the same regardless of content 
                - Unclear and inconsistent format 
                - Unclear what to do with them after
            - Literature notes are important source of where permanent notes come from. [*](((f0wlzXzRy)))
            - Use literature notes to create zettels. Don't turn literature notes into the goal itself. [*](((f0wlzXzRy)))
            - Make permanent notes. Everything before either helps to get to them or is a distraction. [*](((f0wlzXzRy))) #email
        - On limitations of common note taking practices
            - "Underlining sentences and writing comments in the margins is like taking no notes at all" [*](((IiLT5pu2L)))
            - Reading without taking notes, is like not reading at all [*](((IiLT5pu2L)))
            - Highlight as much as you want, but the ultimate measure of the process is whether you create a permanent note [*](((f0wlzXzRy)))
    - 10.2 Keep an Open Mind::
        - Being selective is the key to smart note taking.  
        - But our brains are not good at selecting information.
        - We look for confirming evidence. 
            - If we have a hypothesis, we seek out information to prove it [*](((x1W4xVIOs)))
            - Confirmation bias is a subtle but major force [*](((JGSJdaEzM)))
        - Even great thinkers of history were prone to it, but built systems to counter it
            - Charles Darwin kept a common place book of ideas as well as facts that refute his ideas [*](((qc64s9vJP))) 
        - A system for countering confirmation bias [*](((-EjIbRIKF)))
            - Turn the process on its head by starting with evidence rather than hypothesis [*](((-EjIbRIKF)))
            - Changing incentive from finding confirming facts to finding relevant information [*](((-EjIbRIKF)))
        - The known linear process of writing is insane as it starts with hypothesis and moves towards evidence and confirmation of the hypothesis [*](((HqodWit64)))
        - The slip-box starts from bottom up, and moves towards argument through evidence. Inductive research is more powerful [*](((YO0sVbRjO)))
        - Working inductively is the most important step to opening a mindset for insight [*](((YO0sVbRjO)))
            - More responsive to serendipity, new connections
        - By working with the slip-box we should focus on the following: 
            - Apply our note taking process. Confirm we have seperated tasks. Make sure we have given a true account of the text. [*](((phEVn_shF)))
            - Then make a decision on what we can draw from what we find [*](((4rEIDMRxl)))
        - The importance of seeking a counter argument
            - We are then primed for seeing disconfirming facts [*](((0S4osth0T)))
            - Disconfirming facts are important to writing something interesting. It's impossible to write something interesting if it is elaborating of a single line of argument [*](((0S4osth0T)))
        - The slip-box and its system is topic agnostic [*](((8wPqeAg-u)))
    - 10.3 Get the Gist::
        - Being able to distinguish the important from the unimportant is a skill that takes practice.
            - Writing literature notes helps us do that.  
        - For writing, being able to read a text, and synthesize it to it's important parts is a core skill, one that requires deliberate practice. [*](((TCyRSsTR9)))
        - Practice at reading make us better at detecting patterns, recurrences frames, categories, getting to the gist of a book quicker [*](((xvnduxIMw)))
        - Practice also requires us to be selective about reading, to make decisions about what is important in a text. [*](((wzyxLhq_8)))
            - "Immanuel Kant described in his famous text about the Enlightenment: “Nonage [immaturity] is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s own mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.” (Kant 1784) [*](((wzyxLhq_8)))
        - The ability to develop your own understanding is a challenge. [*](((0Bo86a-RU)))
        - Practice at this tasks manifests in better shorter notes produced quicker.[*](((cHBtAoMcb)))
            - Audiences consider concise and clear expressions as a sign of intelligence [*](((cHBtAoMcb)))
        - The task of practice, practicing note taking, is starting to clearly be contrasted to the more common behaviour of simple reading, underlining and highlighting [*](((av3ZKApO6)))
    - 10.4 Learn to Read::
        - Richard Feynmann said he believed he didn't understand something unless he could give an introductory lecture on it. [*](((Y0GWqkFs2)))
        - A zettelkasten is the equivalent of giving a lecture, but the audience is your future self. [*](((Y0GWqkFs2)))
        - It's also more rigorous than talking, as the scrutiny of writing makes clear unfounded claims or argumentative gaps
        - Reading and re-reading a text can fool us into thinking we understand it, when really the words are tumbling through your brain. Familiarity doesn't mean understanding [*](((RQKWGCajX)))
        - The only way to gauge understanding is to test yourself on it. [*](((5pGdRqCEM)))
        - To test your ability for recall and for synthesis of a text, despite the difficulty or struggle, is the only way to get an account of understanding [*](((5pGdRqCEM)))
        - This process is not supplementary to learning, it is learning. [*](((gPZsuV0dj)))
        - Most students avoid the rigour of testing, yet think they are learning. [*](((eN4Yn6XqF)))
        - A zettelkasten is an external system that forces deliberate practice of learning. [*](((nnCcnBIAE)))
    - 10.5 Learn by Reading::
        - Learning requires deliberate practice, and deliberate practice is difficult, uncomfortable, and easy to sidestep, yet remains the entire validation or error of the learning process. [*](((Vt4Ml7MCT)))
            -  “The one who does the work does the learning,” writes Doyle (2008, 63). It is hard to believe, but in education that is still a revolutionary idea." [*](((Vt4Ml7MCT)))
        - Reading and writing notes effectively is a skill most don't view as a technique, and a skill most don't apply deliberate practice towards, but it is skill of highest leverage when attempting to improve writing.
        -  Teachers who provide sign posts, guides, easily condensed modules or themes, can limit the learning of a student, because there is less emphasis on the difficult task of navigating information, making it unique decisions and interpreting in own words [*](((EB85TMeP7)))
        - Activities that appear difficult in the flow of learning, such as variation, spacing, contextual interference and tests, improve retention and transfer [*](((mgsuJw2WA)))
        - Whereas conditions that feel comfortable, consistent, can fail to support learning [*](((mgsuJw2WA)))
        - If we attempt to work out an answer ourselves, even if we fail, we will retain the actual answer more later if there is a correct way of doing things [*](((O34U8kfWC)))
        - Review and highlighting should not be considered learning [*](((e-OFq1YFu)))
        - The most successful learning method is elaboration. The technique of 'writing for learning' is central to the slip-box method, and it is central to elaboration of raw texts- taking them from a context and translating them in the slip-box for future work. [*](((kjNNcmaWn)))
        - The slip-box is not a storage system primarily. It is a learning system. Not elaborating on what we learn is a waste of time as is a zettelkasten full of information instead of knowledge. [*](((hZ1eqgB_c)))
            - Zettels should be hard fought. [*](((hZ1eqgB_c)))
        - The slip-box take care of the details, allowing the brain to take care of the connections [*](((AKbep7vC2)))
- [[Chapter 11. Take Smart Notes]]
    - Introduction::
        - Research by Kirsti Lonka highlights that unusually successful doctoral students had the trait of being able to use a text they have read, to move beyond the frame presented [*](((FRvWO7EY9)))
        - Experienced academic readers usually read with a question in mind, rather than adopting the question and context of the paper.[*](((x8xsQz6Ns)))
        - Having a bunch of de-contextualised quotes from a text is perhaps the worst approach possible.[*](((x8xsQz6Ns)))
        - Great readers see what is not mentioned in the text [*](((x8xsQz6Ns)))
        - #reflection This section is somewhat unclear to me, because so far the argument has been to work inductively. But not this is saying, work beyond the text. To work beyond the text, that means to have a frame in mind? Which is not inductive? 
        - To create useful notes, you must do more than copy. You must process, synthesize, go beyond what's in front of you in a text. [*](((FHQGvn5p-)))
        - Jerome Bruner says that scientific thinking is what happens when you move beyond the text. If we can't move beyond a context and synthesize, if we accept information only as it is presented, we aren't doing science.  [*](((FHQGvn5p-)))
        - Smart notes is this process of synthesis, moving beyond the context of the original text. It's not just playing with ideas. It's seeing lines of inquiry emerge over time [*](((osyogXLKN)))
    - 11.1 Make a Career One Note at a Time::
        - The power of daily consistent writing
            - Large writing tasks can look intimidating if viewed as a total output, such as writing a 80,000 page book or thesis. But, if looked as an input can be manageable- a page a day for a year achieves the output. [*](((_nFZ_W66U)))
            - #example Anthony Trollope, one of the most productive authors of 19th century had a rigorous writing system.  
                - Start every morning at 5.30am with a coffee and a clock.  
                - Then write at least 250 words every 15 minutes. 
                - Stop when he would write 10 pages. 
                - Doing this for 10 months, would create three novels of three volumes each year.[*](((8_XJr9Hvr)))
            - Academic writing requires different work and different types of tasks than fiction writing, which makes it slower.  
                - Research, searching evidence, referencing, tinkering with ideas
            - As a consequence, having an output goal of "one page per day" isn't a good measure [*](((fAalvJurx)))
            - Instead, adding notes to the slip-box incrementally, accumulates to provide a powerful writing tool. 
                - The hardest day is your first day.  
            - The goal is to write incrementally, add notes daily. Luhmann ended with 90,000 notes. Averaged across his working life, this means he added six notes a day to the slip box. [*](((twrgeVmde)))
            - Even three notes a day will create a significant critical mass, with one new book a year [*](((b26SBAbEZ)))
    - 11.2 Think Outside the Brain::
        - Writing literature notes is a form of deliberate practice.
        - The practice of writing in our own words is key to improvement [*](((AmrtUTwuN)))
        - Permanent notes are a form of deliberate practice as well. [*](((tjWCJM6Cr)))
            - Can you articulate your own thought?
            - Can you write to a future context? 
            - Do we have evidence? 
            - Do we have the stamina
        - Complex thoughts are only possible through writing, scrutiny is only possible in writing [*](((hzPxpEueQ)))
        - Working from memory, and attempting to write from memory is inadequate. [*](((BernhIBab)))
            - Memory is inconsistent, full of bias, and unlikely to recall all known facts at the time of writing [*](((tjWCJM6Cr)))
            - It sees meaning and patterns everywhere, often wrong [*](((BernhIBab)))
        - Writing from the slip box allows you to have a more complete sense of your own work, and it becomes a dialogue [*](((hzPxpEueQ)))
        - Richard Feynman didn't rely on memory to write. He relied on his own notes, as a dialogue partner. [*](((BernhIBab))) [*](((CenVMab1s)))
            - When asked in an interview he said of his notes "“No, no!” Feynman protested. “They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process. I actually did the work on the paper." [*](((CenVMab1s)))
            - Feynman described his notes- “No, it’s not a record, not really. It’s working. You have to work on paper, and this is the paper.”[ 33] [*](((b2JJMuWK1)))
            - "Work on paper" Nice expression
        - There is little consensus about how the brain works across different disciplines like philosophers, neuroscientists, educators. But there is consensus on the importance of not relying on it exclusively for thinking. [*](((2sYG94d4g)))
            - To use an external scaffold is required, to see things as anew.
        - [[Sönke Ahrens]] reflects on his own notes on a particular book called "“Scarcity: Why Having Too Little Means So Much” (2013) by Mullainathan and Shafir. 
            - Literature notes
                - Summarised the argument of the book, with a few questions in mind such as: [*](((_uAV-EOTz)))
                    -  Is this convincing? [*](((_uAV-EOTz)))
                    - What methods do they use? [*](((_uAV-EOTz)))
                    - Which of the references are familiar? [*](((_uAV-EOTz)))
            - Permanent notes
                - First question when writing permanent notes: 
                    - "What does this all mean for my own research" [*](((eNwLWd0n0)))
                        - "But the first question I asked myself when it came to writing the first permanent note for the slip-box was: What does this all mean for my own research and the questions I think about in my slip-box? This is just another way of asking: Why did the aspects I wrote down catch my interest?"
                    - An example permanent note from the book: 
                        - “Any comprehensive analysis of social inequality must include the cognitive effects of scarcity. Cf. Mullainathan and Shafir 2013.” This immediately triggers further questions, which I can discuss on following notes, starting with: “Why?” [*](((6UwlWjiRr)))
                        - The answer why becomes a line of further inquiry
                            - "While I am writing these notes, it becomes obvious that the answer to the question “why” has already triggered more follow-up questions, like: Isn’t this already discussed in theories of social inequality? If yes: Who discussed it? If not: Why not? And where do I turn to, to find answers to these questions? Correct: The first choice for further inquiry is the slip-box. Maybe there is already something on social inequality that helps me to answer these questions, or at least an indication of where to look.")
                - Permanent notes become rewritten literature notes for the future context.  
            - The more notes the slip-box contains, the more prolific the connections will become [*](((1yQzlfyLI)))
            - #reflection Permanent notes as lines of inquiry. It's going to be hard to write to a shared context, but we can try and see what happens.  
                - The other thing we can do is write to our own contexts, take permanant notes and ask questions of them. 
    - 11.3 Learn by not Trying::
        - Getting the gist is key
        - Selection is the key to performance, character, identity. What we choose, is who we are. 
        - Selection is an important characteristic of performance
        - Selection is important to memory too. We don't remember everything, it's selective, and the selection is key. Otherwise it would be overwhelming [*](((4vqqWDCuL)))
        - Solomon Shereshevsky had a perfect memory but was unable to make decisions on what was important [*](((4vqqWDCuL))) [*](((m535H4xNn))) [*](((v4uTJLRFT)))
            - Tested, had different memory capacity to normal. It was 
            - It was a liability, because he also couldn't forget anything. He was incable of getting the gist of anything. 
            - He could repeat an entire novel but couldn't describe what it meant [*](((v4uTJLRFT)))
            - The inability to forget things, left his brain little capacity to think in abstract terms. To select what is important. [*](((GnAPJ301Y)))
        - Evidence is unclear whether we all have the capacity like Solomon to remember everything, or whether we purposely forget things
            - Sometimes our memories can emerge in context. A particular reminder is enough for us to think of something long thought forgotten [*](((l3Z_t0R9K)))
            - Forgetting is "erecting a mental barrier", the act of selection, freeing up brain capacity for further thinking [*](((l3Z_t0R9K)))
            - The ability to forget systematically gives us the capacity to choose what to remember [*](((CWYS7gQKl)))
        - William James describes the importance of selection in 1890
            - "“Selection is the very keel on which our mental ship is built. And in this case of memory its utility is obvious. If we remembered everything, we should on most occasions be as ill off as if we remembered nothing. It would take as long for us to recall a space of time as it took the original time to elapse, and we should never get ahead with our thinking.” (William James 1890, 680)."
            - 
        - Writing literature notes is better than writing fleeting notes, but ultimately the goal is to create permanent notes, to create our own lattice work of ideas. [*](((Ik_kcHogX)))
        - Using an external memory, allows us to forget ideas too. We aren't needing to hold everything in our head [*](((wz1tMENoR)))
        - Researchers Robert and Elizabeth Bjork describe two functions of memory [*](((J0FDxuUyD)))
            - Storage strength
                - They suggest this is how most people view their memory capacity- the capacity to remember facts, analogous to a computer hard drive [*](((J0FDxuUyD)))
            - Retrieval strength
                - The ability to surface information at the right time, to make connections [*](((2IObrNCCg)))
                - Every piece of information is considered in the context of other information [*](((pZPxO9lYf)))
        - Most students attempt to improve storage strength. Filling the brain with facts, and testing recall ability. [*](((fqbzgEa19)))
        - The importance of context is shown when someone tests themselves on familiar information in a new setting or under different conditions and memory breaks down [*](((K9qL_wS4V)))
        - Learning is about making connections between ideas rather than recall alone [*](((29l608MMw)))
        - Historically education has been built around storage strength. Being able to fill the brain with facts and this is wrong [*](((KxVXL0_m8)))
            - Hermman Ebbinghaus seminal in learning theory focussed on storage strength as the key to learning, and this is suggested wrong. [*](((KxVXL0_m8)))
        - We are impressed by good memory, and we see it as a measure of intelligence. [*](((L4riGXgJ2)))
            - Memory artists for example [*](((L4riGXgJ2)))
        - There is no need for memory tricks when writing. Use an external source. [*](((ygcd2fxLM)))
        - An alternative frame for the concept of literature notes is the elaboration method which has proven useful according to McDaniel and Donnelly 1996 [*](((AQEyeuXh9)))
            - Write things in your own words
            - Retention is supported when individuals are asked to elaborate [*](((AQEyeuXh9)))
            - See also Stein et al. 1984
            - Elaboration is useful because it fosters learning through comparison, and sensing relations and difference between things [*](((2Uq2Xd0uj)))
        - Understanding is more important than familiarity. Learning isn't information. [*](((ccEuIyOs3)))
            - This was a a focus for Richard Feynman, for whom the test of education is whether someone could explain an idea simply, via their own experience.[*](((ccEuIyOs3)))
        - Writing notes and adding them to a slip box, is a vehicle for understanding. It is distinct from filling information. [*](((eZN77TuFJ)))
        - [[Zettel structure]] The slip-box makes possible elaborating questions: [*](((eZN77TuFJ))) #email
            - What does this mean? [*](((eZN77TuFJ)))
            - How does it connect to...? [*](((eZN77TuFJ)))
            - What is the difference between...? [*](((eZN77TuFJ)))
            - What is it similar to? [*](((eZN77TuFJ)))
        - [[Zettel structure]] "That the slip-box is not sorted by topics is the precondition for actively building connections between notes. Connections can be made between heterogeneous notes–as long as the connection makes sense." [*](((eZN77TuFJ))) #email
        - [[Zettel structure]] "This is the best antidote to the impeding way most information is given to us in our learning institutions. Most often, it comes in modular form, sorted by topic, separated by disciplines and generally isolated from other information. The slip-box is forcing us to do the exact opposite: To elaborate, to understand, to connect and therefore to learn seriously." [*](((eZN77TuFJ)))
        - Too much structure and order can impede learning. Contrast and variation can aid learning. #messiness [*](((ljQOefd5j)))
            - Useful argument for different versions of the same zettel
    - 11.4 Adding Permanent Notes to the Slip - Box::
        - Add a note behind a note you refer to 
        - Or if you don't follow up a specific note, in sequence. 
        - In a manual system the next sequential number would added manually 
        - Can create cards as new note sequences- a card which creates a new sequence of other numbers. This is the latticework. [*](((3uqf-NuRw))) [*](((5Sn3gQkxy)))
        - [[Zettel structure]] Note sequences are what we aim for after we have a list of zettels. 
- [[Chapter 12. Develop Ideas]]
    - Introduction::
        - Luhmann describes his notes as a network, with each individual note representing a node, connected to other places. [*](((y71U3OIU_)))
        - If you have existing lines of inquiry, your new notes will ideally extend those existing themes, but this harder to do starting a new slip-box [*](((w0V5_IvQg)))
        - Luhmann's branching numbering system. Each top line number represents a new note with seperate theme, each sub number represents a note that has been added that extends the top line theme
        - {{mermaid}}
            - graph LR; 
            - 1-->2
            - 1-->1a
            - 1a-->1b
            - 2-->3
            - 2-->2a
            - 3-->4
            - 3-->3a
        - Notes sequences are the latticework of thought, they represent the development of ideas. 
        - Each subbranch can become a distinct line of inquiry with enough notes [*](((w0V5_IvQg)))
        - Inductive themes emerge, and good ones or those that appeal get more notes over time [*](((P-qYCOOKr)))
        - #reflection We don't need to build the sequence into the first layer zettels in Roam. We can create the sequence separately with block references. 
            - The goal of the zettelkasten is not to have a topic ordered structure. The goal is to have each idea as an atomic layer that can be then utilised in new sequences. [*](((7hcRk98a3))) #[[Zettel structure]]
            - A topic related order would impose too much of a hierarchical top down structure upfront [*](((7hcRk98a3))) #[[Zettel structure]]
            - A pure abstract order would not allow idea clusters and topics to be built bottom up [*](((7hcRk98a3))) #[[Zettel structure]]
        - So to make this work colellective, create a group zettel and then create individual sequences [[Zettel structure]]
        - The note number sequences are the foundation of texts. [*](((7hcRk98a3)))
        - A loose order in the sequences allows you to change orders later. 
        - It's impossible to get a topic overview of the slip-box, or a contents page of the slip box. By design the system will grow bigger than what we can see. Give up on index idea.
            - But the note sequences are chunks. They themselves represent activity [*](((wGGcv4ThN))). By scanning the note sequences, we can navigate around the zettelkasten. 
            - The slip-box is how we think, not what we think about. Think about how impossible it would be to create a contents page for your brain.[*](((wGGcv4ThN)))
    - Introduction:: Accidental double note taking (good comparison)
        - Notes gain power through the network to other notes [*](((y71U3OIU_)))
        - Themes in the slip box emerged inductively over time. New notes will connect to existing notes in new ways [*](((w0V5_IvQg)))
        - Notes that add to a known theme in the slip-box themselves can become a theme [*](((P-qYCOOKr)))
        - The note sequences are the critical part of the slip-box [*](((7hcRk98a3)))
        - The slip-box is never complete. [*](((iXpbFQLs4)))
        - The slip-box is not a single topic. It's multiple topics. We don't need an index of the slip box, we need jumping off points [*](((wGGcv4ThN)))
    - 12.1 Develop Topics::
        - A Zettelkasten must be structured for rediscovery. [*](((UjeoZyqmz)))
            - Keywords can be added to the note. Luhmann's preference was for this to be economical. Not many. [*](((UjeoZyqmz)))
            - The Zettelkasten isn't an archive. It should not be thought of as an index. It should be thought of as a thinking tool, which means links between notes are important. Giving yourself lines of thought [*](((UjeoZyqmz)))
            - It is the sequence between notes that allows you to develop topics [*](((WBqF2KHKp)))
        - The slip-box can surprise us with previous notes [*](((WBqF2KHKp)))
        - Most notes will be found through other notes [*](((WBqF2KHKp)))
        - The goal is not to rely on an index. But instead, to get down to the level of connections. How one idea is linked to another [*](((WBqF2KHKp)))
        - We can't get an overview of the slip box. But we can get an overview of a topic in the slip-box. 
        -  "The consideration of how to structure a topic, therefore, belongs on notes as well–and not on a meta-hierarchical level. We can provide ourselves with a (temporarily valid) overview over a topic or subtopic just by making another note. If we then link from the index to such a note, we have a good entry point." [*](((WBqF2KHKp)))
        - Keywords should be optimized for rediscovery
            - "The way people choose their keywords shows clearly if they think like an archivist or a writer. Do they wonder where to store a note or how to retrieve it? The archivist asks: Which keyword is the most fitting? A writer asks: In which circumstances will I want to stumble upon this note, even if I forget about it? It is a crucial difference."
        - #reflection What is the keyword structure now? Should these be baked into notes?  Or do we keep it clean. This isn't the same as link between notes.   
        - Keywords should be optimized for your lines of inquiry, the themes or ideas of interest, rather than the context of the note itself [*](((UhUikcAob)))
        - Applying keywords is a critical act of thinking [*](((y-QzuWS21)))
    - 12.2 Make Smart Connections::
        - Luhmman had four types of cross references. 2 of these were related to restrictions of paper
        - Bi-directional links and block referencing makes this simple [*](((ii28A6Myd)))
        - Looking for patterns
        - The search for meaningful connections is the task of the Zettelkasten [*](((yc-k4-Z2l)))
            - Luhmman was able to draw themes across things like love, money, power, truth, justice.[*](((r5ZeouWw-)))
        - Themes will become a network of ideas. Rooted in facts.  With the facts at hand if we want to explore across the Zettelkasten [*](((Xs1fLmaxP)))
        - 
    - 12.3 Compare, Correct and Differentiate::
        - Using an external memory means that often you will rediscover your own thoughts. Ideas you believe to be new, are revealed to already exist in the Zettelkasten, and perhaps not even be yours [*](((Xs1fLmaxP)))
        - Comparison between notes is a useful way to clarify thinking further, can surface contradictions, paradoxes [*](((QjptgqZoG))) [*](((J4BD3ktG0)))
        - Comparison over time can reveal changes in your own perception too [*](((XoQaUBUs-)))
        - Disconnecting our thoughts from what is in mind at any time, to an external Zettelkasten can help overcome the feature-positive effect, where we tend to overstate the importance of information easily available to us [*](((UlnGDxXow)))

    - 12.4 Assemble a Toolbox for Thinking::
        - Revisitng your own familiar ideas is a recommended way to learn, and the Zetttelkasten fits this mode. The use of flashcard for example is an excellent way to learn, but the Zettelkasten extends this much further to allow for flash cards with context  [*](((ZCqW4TrXP)))
        - Our knowledge of the world is depending on context
        - Some theories are versatile and useful in different situations [*](((nD7ENZrJ2)))
        - Use theories that help you navigate reality. The utility of academic knowledge is the extent to which it provides a mental model for how and what ways to act in the world [*](((1wgkvLBXo)))
        - Charlie Munger talked about 'Worldly Wisdom', which is both to have a mental models, along with experience in the world [*](((1wgkvLBXo)))
        - Theory is important for Munger. Isolated facts aren't useful thought. Passing tests is a failure of this method [*](((jbhsgjkso)))
        - Being wise is the set of mental frameworks you use to interpret new information, leading to different outcomes than others [*](((kB0DxNvn3)))
        - To live 1000 years, use the thoughts of others [*](((kB0DxNvn3)))
        - Helmet Sachs describes learning as a process of retaining basics, creating associations. Learning becomes fun. [*](((PWK_O3mj5)))
            - "His recommendations for learning read almost like instructions for the slip-box: 1. Pay attention to what you want to remember. 2. Properly encode the information you want to keep. (This includes thinking about suitable cues.) 3. Practice recall. (Ibid., 31)"
        - We learn when we encode knowledge, but also when we retrieve knowledge [*](((3alXROjys)))

        - 
    - 12.5 Use the Slip - Box as a Creativity Machine::
        - "“Creativity is just connecting things. When you ask creative people how they did something, they feel a little guilty because they didn’t really do it, they just saw something.” (Steve Jobs)"
        - The eureka story as genesis moment for great ideas is common of great discoveries [*](((tsuFTnm5G)))
        - However, closer inspection reveals these stories rely on long apprenticeships with ideas [*](((8OsaRd7c8)))
            - Whilst scientists often describe their decision making on intuition [*](((efk5QQcC7))) but this embodied knowledge [*](((efk5QQcC7)))
        - Steven Johnson describes this process as a [[Slow Hunch]] where ideas emerge and crystalize through time [*](((m6DITkv3w)))
        - Dramatic ideas are the result of long incremental accumulation processes, similar to the slip box [*](((eNe77kPqt)))
        - 
    - 12.6 Think Inside the Box::
        - Creativity is about making connections, seeing associations. Higher performers see new or better ones [*](((dWxS7_baj)))
        - Playing and tinkering is how we achieve new ideas and exceptional texts [*](((8p-Wx0Zuh)))
        - To achieve great combinations, we must liberate the idea from its original context. Abstraction is necessary. Darwin used birds to abstract to a theory about evolution [*](((ufyJtDIzl)))
        - Abstraction highlights the importance of analogy. Even art, for example Romeo and Juliet, is a story about love for us, not the details of two families [*](((TFllyPzjk)))
        - The ability to make better abstractions is a key skill in engineering too [*](((pFJj_C203)))
        - Our brains are routine machines. Some of these routines are not optimised for learning. 
        - Burger and Starbird (2012) have a system for thinking containing five elements
            - Feedback loops
            - Find ways to confront errors and misunderstandings
            - Focus on the main ideas behind the details 
            - Make sure that you really see what you think you see and describe it as factually as possible 
            - Take a simple idea seriously
        - How do we find what's missing from our ideas? 
        - Reviewing notes alone doesn't help show us what's missing. [*](((ybXRYhjkL)))
            - Abraham Ward's idea of [[Survivorship Bias]]
                - ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FAja3wXLu3P.png?alt=media&token=92dd8c22-9694-4811-8052-9cd0017c488e)
        - Robert McMath assembled a collection of supermarket products, and realised that the vast majority of items he collected ended up as [failed items](https://archive.seattletimes.com/archive/?date=19960310&slug=2318262) [*](((FzeaxGF4w)))
        - Oliver Burkeman in his [book](https://www.amazon.com.au/Antidote-Oliver-Burkeman/dp/0865478015) describes that we are too focussed on success and neglect failure [*](((48BXqArTk)))
        - Ask what if? [*](((6TKwoaoFV)))
        - A banal characteristic of great achievers: Take a simple idea seriously.[*](((C477jLhtI))) [*](((9PFWOr7ek)))
            - Example in the book is buying stock.
        - Great discoveries can also be the surfacing of a simple principle that explains complexity [*](((RWsc-cocv)))
        - Using the slip-box every day is a way to train important skills. Taking notes is a simple idea. Take it seriously to do something extraordinary [*](((zD_LxkuL0)))
    - 12.7 Facilitate Creativity through Restrictions::
        - The Slip-box is a set of constraints. [*](((7p9-c0Nxy)))
        - It limits choice through standardization [*](((CVH8smrOg)))
            - Think of page numbers, letters of alphabet [*](((-WcP8wYgq))), all standardizations that allow us to do something with text [*](((CVH8smrOg)))
        - Standardization and constraint is generally regarded as a negative, but it can be a powerful enabler of performance [*](((AT3B9tugn)))
            - Barry Schwartz in Paradox of Choice describes the negative consequences of choice
        - Creativity can flourish within constraints [*](((akjSHryB0)))
        - The act of breaking convention, depends on convention [*](((5_G906hd1)))
        - The biggest threat to science is a lack of standardization, as without standardization comparisons aren't possible [*](((cEY7Tb21M)))
- [[Chapter 13. Share Your Insight]]
    - Introduction::
        - Writing helps articulate what is missing in your thinking [*](((5LSeCJWB5)))
        - Writing is essentially a process of revising [*](((IW5176D3O))). Writing things down make clear what to revise
        - Clusters emerges as groups of notes in the zettelkasten, and then these become the structure of your argument for a written document.  
        - Use these clusters as preliminary 
        - #reflection Clusters are different from topics of concepts.  Topics/concepts  are tags on individual notes. But clusters represent accumulating amount of notes on a particular topic. A particular amount of dense notes in a particular sequence.
    - 13.1 From Brainstorming to Slip - box - Storming::
        - Another quote about bias as a result of proximity of information [*](((X88S_eLxU)))
            - "“Remember the lesson: ‘An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily available to you.’” (Charles T. Munger)"
        - [[Brainstorming]] is the antithesis of the slip-box. 
            - Brainstorming described in 1919 by [[Alexander Osborn]] and gained a wider audience in 1958 with the book 
                -  “Brainstorming: The Dynamic New Way to Create Successful Ideas” from [[Charles Hutchison Clark]] [*](((BoMv2rwrm)))
            - 
        - Outdated view of ideas, outdated fixation on the brain as the generator of ideas. 
        - Brain prioritises information that is available at the moment, which is both incomplete and biased [*](((TNZTnyXIC)))
        - Group brainstorming often results in less ideas and become limited to a narrower band of topics [*](((hPc8a-oN6)))
        - Attempting to generate an idea spontaneously, might be a sign of a faulty knowledge documentation process [*](((UQ6LCIFw5))) [*](((TNZTnyXIC)))
        - Attempting to find a topic to write about relying on what's in your head at any given time, is an error and a consequence of viewing the writing task seperate, in the traditional linear way. [*](((TNZTnyXIC)))
        - The slip-box makes clear what to write about, because the density of notes and clusters represents the inductive development of ideas [*](((ZCuBct3ni)))
            - We answer this question daily, through our notes added to the slip-box [*](((ZCuBct3ni)))
        - And is reinforcing, because seeing clusters means we are more likely to add to those clusters [*](((dBAakL4ka)))
        - The task of writing is rediscovering and adding to your existing questions, rather than thinking about what to write [*](((cb49wJYtV)))
        - It will also allow us to see which of our ideas fit the different types of output forms, and how they change over time. Ideas that seem good to begin with, end up not good ideas [*](((yxiVJbBCB))) 
        - Don't write on ideas you aren't familiar with. Ideas from the slip-box become tried and tested [*](((30eozOwaL)))
        - Find the sweet-spot of ideas. Familiar enough, but then at the edge of recombination discovery [*](((ZIzflMK1K)))
        - 
    - 13.2 From Top Down to Bottom Up::
        - Creating inductive ideas is major advantage. More effective ideas. [*](((m40BOGCTg)))
        - Exposure to new ideas is not they key to insight. The key to insight is intense elaboration on the ideas you are familiar with [*](((wYgj-NeXq)))
            - Look up [Rheinberger 1997](https://www.amazon.com/Toward-History-Epistemic-Things-Synthesizing/dp/0804727864)
        - "Rare groundbreaking art is also rarely created on a whim by an accidental artist who believes himself to be amazingly innovative." [*](((eXnVlAw_T)))
            - "The more time an artist dedicates to understanding an aesthetic "problem", the more unexpected and creative his solutions will be regarded by later experts" [*](((eXnVlAw_T)))
            - 
        - #reflection There is a threshold of familiarity with ideas, before breakthrough innovation occurs.  You don't complete ideas. You should mull over them, over a long time. 
    - 13.3 Getting Things Done by Following Your Interests::
        - Motivation fails because people cease to see meaning in what they are doing [*](((hKJOIwEyi)))
            - Is this useful as a mode for Book club? 
        - Motivation is gained by seeing a project move forward [*](((Z5N8eiygA)))
        -  Demotivating to be stuck with a project that doesn't seem worth doing [*](((Z5N8eiygA)))
        - If we ask the question- what is so interesting about this? And use this as the organizing principle of taking notes, we will have a guide for making decisions. 
        - Improvisation, and the ability to change direction of our work, is a type of control, and is different from attempting to control by sticking to a predetermined plan [*](((yci8SvoAM))
        - Improvisation, and the ability to change direction of our work, is a type of control, and is different from attempting to control by sticking to a predetermined plan [*](((yci8SvoAM)))
        - At the time Crick and Watson discovered DNA they were working on a grant focussed on curing cancer. If they had stuck to their grant plan and not pursued their intuition with idea that discovered, they wouldn't have made the discovery. [*](((yci8SvoAM)))
            - They only could say what their plan was, once their discovery was made. [*](((yci8SvoAM)))
        - Have the courage not to plan outcomes, have the courage to avoid rigid structures. Dance with your ideas, leave some behind for the new [*](((I6Gh5naNy)))
        - Does choice vitalise regulatory strength? Does the type of choice matter? 
            - If a person is offered a choice among options that are trivial or unnecessary, the choice saps energy and can lead to apathy  [*](((bo0TZ56Yf)))
            - 
    - 13.4 Finishing and Review::
        - The work is already done. [*](((1PZ8kGAvZ))) 
        - Writing is linear, the task becomes to make thought linear [*](((HPsszNE2F)))
        - A zettelkasten will often provide too much choice, the opposite of the blank page problem.  Discernment is useful [*](((9TWMLIhQ4)))
        - Working on multiple projects is a useful way to give time for synthesis of writing, reflection, editing [*](((TNNxdmyUe)))
        - Generating writing will generate extra ideas. Process them back into the slip-box for later [*](((NdJ4GyYxx))) [*](((yCbbkHB85)))
        - Luhmann never forced himself to do anything, would only work on projects till when he felt a useful exhastion of ides and put them down for later [*](((2WQrQNiI-)))

- [[Chapter 14. Make it a Habit]]
    - "Civilisation advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” (Whitehead)" [*](((A__OvFWYO)))
    - Habits manifest over time. What we do next is likely to be similar to what we have done already [*](((Fp1u0yeBT)))
    - To change, we first must assess and understand what it is we currently do, and understand the complexity of the task of change [*](((x5hx3y9ay)))
    - Those with strong habits inaccurately predicted their performance, largely because the power of habit is that it makes effort invisible [*](((uOQBxSUdK)))
    - Willpower won't achieve consistent performance. Build habits over time, and give them a chance to replace old one. Routines will beat willpower. [*](((4hIM0I_l_)))
- [[Afterword]]
    - [[Sönke Ahrens]] has used a slip-box to write this book [*](((E6GPQOQKr)))
    - [[Luhmann]] used it to great power through his career too [*](((QVfNEbAfL)))
    - Both are examples of the power of the slip-box. 
    - Nevertheless, students aren't entirely familiar with this idea. 
    - The process does not put the learner at the centre of the learning process. It puts the slip-box at the centre. [*](((AEToJgvmY)))
    - The Slip-box is not about storing information. There are many ways to store information. The Slip-box instead is a method of work, a set of routines and practices that can transform performance. [*](((ID232vsr4)))
    - A slip-box requires effort, it is the effort of going to the gym. It requires a change in work routines. [*](((ID232vsr4)))
