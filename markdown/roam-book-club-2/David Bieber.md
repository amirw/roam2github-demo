- Assorted notes:
    - The next few months until mid-December are particularly busy for me, so TBD  how engaged I'll be with the book club. If the notes below are empty, that's why! Feel free to ping me to reengage if you see fit though.
- Literature Notes::
    - [[Introduction]]
        - ["Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note"](((hG7TRPF5I))).
            - So it begins.
        - ["Note-taking flies mostly under the radar: We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly"](((1NqxVWlvh)))
            - This quote motivates the question: What are the short-comings of my own note-taking practices?
            - Turning the sprawl of notes into something worth sharing requires removing a lot, and narrowing focus considerably. My note-taking system doesn't currently lend itself to this narrowing of focus.
            - Variations on a theme. My current note-taking system makes it easy to write a second (third, etc) variation on a theme similar to something I've written before. But then it doesn't lend visibility to the diff between the variations that I've written. Sometimes it's not even readily apparent where these variations live.
        - ["Few struggle to text their friends or write emails."](((VQiKWP6bz)))
            - This is exactly how I think about writing "snippets". I know that the barrier to writing can be low, because the barrier to thinking is low, and the barrier to private journalling is low. (Whereas I find there are mental barriers to writing on social media, or to large groups at work, for example.) So I set up a system for myself called "snippets" to bring the barriers to writing **and publishing** as close as possible to those of thinking and private journalling as I could.
        - ["What does make a significant difference along the whole intelligence spectrum is something else: how much self-discipline or self-control one uses to approach the tasks at hand"](((KqvBsDubC)))
            - When noting the importance of self-discipline it's important to also remark on the value of setting up your environment to support you. By setting up your environment in advance, you can get the benefits of self-discipline without needing to exercise as much willpower. Classic examples: keep your phone far from your bed if you don't want to scroll endlessly before going to sleep; keep the unhealthy beverages hidden so you aren't tempted by them as much.
            - ["Not __having__ willpower, but __not having to use__ willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success."](((tIetkYe5Q))) Ah, I see that's where they were going with this already.
        - I think it would be helpful to paste the text of the book in smaller chunks, e.g. sentences instead of paragraphs. Currently if you want to quote something you can link to a full-paragraph block (e.g. "The right question is: What can we do differently in the weeks, months or even years before we face the blank page that will get us into the best possible position to write a great paper easily? Very few people struggle with their papers because they don’t know how to cite correctly or because they suffer from a psychological issue that keeps them from writing. Few struggle to text their friends or write emails. The rules of citation can be looked up and there is no way that there are as many mental issues as papers postponed. Most people struggle for much more mundane reasons, and one is the myth of the blank page itself. They struggle because they believe, as they are made to believe, that writing starts with a blank page. If you believe that you have indeed nothing at hand to fill it, you have a very good reason to panic. Just having it all in your head is not enough, as getting it down on paper is the hard bit. That is why good, productive writing is based on good note-taking. Getting something that is already written into another written piece is incomparably easier than assembling everything in your mind and then trying to retrieve it from there."), but usually I want to quote a more specific section like an individual sentence (e.g. "["Few struggle to text their friends or write emails."](((VQiKWP6bz)))"). Wdyt?
#[[Questions (META)]]
            - As a workaround, I'm going to use aliases for now. So I can quote a full paragraph but have it appear as just the sentence I care about.

            - ["Even though this study was never published, makes no claims about intelligence and is statistically irrelevant, it does seem to confirm what most of us believe anyway and that is that we might have an attention deficit problem."](((bXWICxkpS))) WAT. You can't just cite an unpublished study that doesn't make the claim you say it makes and "is statistically irrelevant" as if it's backing up your point. That's not how studies work.
