        - It'd be cool to see a video of that workflow
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:27 PM)
        - Love the value of randomization ‚Äî drives serendipity
    - From Stanley to Everyone: (1:27 PM)
        - randomization is the only thing better than whiskey to drive serendipity
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:28 PM)
        - I love that phrase, ‚Äú‚Ä¶makes the infinite digestible"
            - [[randomization]] makes the infinite digestible #quote [[Brandon Toner]]

        - Lagavulin is brilliant
    - From Bill Petro to Everyone: (1:30 PM)
        - Roam42 by RoamHacker makes Roam both simpler and more powerful.

    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:31 PM)
        - Fleeting = raw to me
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:31 PM)
        - Do any Believers know if there are any ways we can now or will be able to incorporate our writing in the Book Club graph in our own Roam graphs without just copying and pasting‚Ä¶.yes, I‚Äôm talking about cross-graph block referencing
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:31 PM)
        - With Roam, almost nothing is lost, so it‚Äôs the less processed version of ideas
    - From Me to Everyone: (1:31 PM)
        - Hi stakes definition! Capture this note or lose it to the abyss!
    - From Myles Orme to Everyone: (1:32 PM)

    - From Alex Shchedrin to Everyone: (1:33 PM)
        - Should we come up with a different name for Fleeting notes?
    - From Kristina Wolter to Everyone: (1:33 PM)
        - @Brandon - how do you process the ideas that come out while walking, biking, not with a notebook?  When Roam is not w/in reach?
            - #Chat [[Brandon Toner]] Great question [[@[[Kristina Wolter]]]], right now ‚Äî I don't have a great capture for when I'm totally hands-free. 
                - [[Otter.ai]] helps in some situations
                    - I make voice-notes in Otter while driving. This is awesome!
                - [[Drafts (app)]] helps when I can type
                    - I've been working on some drafts "actions" for formatting before sync into Roam via [[Quick Capture]]
                - Alternatively to [[Drafts (app)]], [[Siri Shortcuts]] is good. 
    - From Me to Everyone: (1:33 PM)
        - Brandon‚Äôs point that ‚Äúfleeting‚Äù has a different meaning on paper; roam is a one of a kind environment that allows the note to persist forever
            - [[Brandon Toner]] #[[fleeting notes]]
    - From Kristen Pavle to Everyone: (1:33 PM)
        - +1 to blind yourself from it

    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:34 PM)
        - in a regular old paper notebook @Kristina‚Ä¶and scraps of paper‚Ä¶and a note on your phone, etc. are some of the ways
    - From Kristen Pavle to Everyone: (1:34 PM)
        - Kristina - we talked about audio dictation >> text apps
    - From Myles Orme to Everyone: (1:34 PM)
        - There‚Äôs this term ‚Äòseedlings‚Äô that may be a different version of ‚Äòfeeling notes'
    - From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:34 PM)
        - I was wondering that myself. My graph is small (4 weeks) ‚Äî is there a size when it becomes too big to be useful. My fleeting notes are also in other tools.
    - From StephanC to Everyone: (1:34 PM)
        - @Kristina I use Draft app
    - From Gene Z to Everyone: (1:34 PM)
        - I believe there's merit to deleting fleeting notes, I see value in determining something is not worth keeping or seeing again. Too much noise
            - #[[fleeting notes]]
    - From Myles Orme to Everyone: (1:34 PM)
        - +1 for noice
    - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (1:34 PM)

        - Constraints affect the content
            - #constraints
    - From Matthew McKinlay to Everyone: (1:35 PM)
        - You can filter and with tags
    - From izzy to Everyone: (1:35 PM)
        - So much of this is so contextual to the use case, of course, I think

            - #capture #[[The [[Collectors Fallacy]]]]
                - #Chat [[Brandon Toner]] [[@[[Andy Henson]]]]
                    - I'm not sure I agree with the nature of data in Roam, I'm not too worried about the collector's fallacy
    - From Art Assoiants to Everyone: (1:35 PM)
        - It's a good question. What % of the total content we create in the database do any of us replay with?
    - From Mary Chipman to Everyone: (1:36 PM)
        - Signal-to-Noise -- fleeting notes have terrific potential to heavily weight the Noise part of that equation if you just indiscriminately dump every fleeting note into Roam and then forget it.
    - From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:36 PM)
        - Or multiple graphs?
    - From Me to Everyone: (1:36 PM)
        - +1 Matthew McKinlay - the filtering is EVERYTHING for me and the evolution of better and better tags
    - From Art Assoiants to Everyone: (1:36 PM)
        - [[Collectors Fallacy]] is neat. Or data hoarding lol
    - From Jeremie Rykner to Everyone: (1:36 PM)
        - @matt @Kristina for quick notes on the go, you can use Drafts(ios) or otter.ai for quick voice that auto transcribes
    - From Gene Z to Everyone: (1:36 PM)
        - Not everything is worth remembering. Our brains know this.
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:36 PM)
        - Does anyone have a clear workflow for discovery in Roam?
    - From Art Assoiants to Everyone: (1:36 PM)
        - I remember Tim Ferriss saying "the good shit sticks"
            - #quote #[[Tim Ferriss]]

    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:37 PM)
        - Yes, @mattbrockwell‚Ä¶agree

        - ‚ÄúNothing good ever gets away‚Äù - John Steinbeck
    - From Kristen Pavle to Everyone: (1:37 PM)
        - Very much relate to what Matt is saying!
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:37 PM)
        - yes, the zettel has purpse
    - From izzy to Everyone: (1:37 PM)
        - That was my recent breakthrough with my reading list, that I needed to know _why_ a thing interested me and also include enough for it to come up again in the right contexts
    - From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:37 PM)
        - But then there‚Äôs that issue of serendipity, where you see connections you didn‚Äôt intend. This may be short-circuited by deletion.
            - #[[fleeting notes]]
    - From izzy to Everyone: (1:37 PM)
        - Instead of just a list of titles and authors
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:37 PM)
        - Glad we‚Äôre saving the chat!
    - From Justin Johnson to Everyone: (1:37 PM)
        - I‚Äôm curious who has been smart note taking the longest, and how they do things.
            - [[@Matthew McKinlay]] ‚Äî this might be a great discussion (see who in the community has been doing this for an extended period of time. I'd be curious to hear their experience.)
    - From Jeremie Rykner to Everyone: (1:37 PM)
        - When paper and space was limited and had a COST, people were thinking twice before writing something and keeping it
    - From Stanley to Everyone: (1:37 PM)
        - fleeting notes (imo) take away the pressure of doing something ‚Äúright‚Äù
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:38 PM)
        - Roam allows us to keep both the Zettel (the ‚Äúgood‚Äù stuff) as well as the dross (which might be reusable).
            - #[[fleeting notes]]
    - From Me to Everyone: (1:38 PM)
        - Yay WELCOME, LUCA!
    - From Justin Johnson to Everyone: (1:38 PM)
        - I bought the book.  I must have been the first person ever to buy the first ever Roam book.
    - From Stanley to Everyone: (1:38 PM)
        - Personally I think that when someone allows themselves to be wrong or off about something they really start doing that ‚Äúgood shit‚Äù
    - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (1:38 PM)
        - @stanley what if the ‚Äúright‚Äù comes to be, and then you‚Äôre moving with forth-rightness?
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:38 PM)
        - @jeremierykner On the other hand, they were THINKING twice instead of just throwing everything in a big pile
    - From Fernando C. to Everyone: (1:39 PM)
        - We briefly discussed this very idea in Breakout Room 8.
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:39 PM)
        - @stanley That‚Äôs why I love Roam‚Ä¶best of both worlds
    - From Stanley to Everyone: (1:39 PM)
        - hmm... i wanna know more about ‚Äúforth-rightness‚Äù -@Beau
    - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (1:39 PM)

        - Kristen I agree
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:39 PM)
        - @beau ‚Äî YEA DUDE
    - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (1:40 PM)
        - @stanley it‚Äôs like lifting weights‚Ä¶ once you know how to do a properly formed squat, then it‚Äôs not about the form and function, but the weight you‚Äôre adding to it‚Ä¶
            - #quality
    - From Nicole Drumhiller to Everyone: (1:40 PM)
        - Yes Kristen like a ‚Äúchoose your own adventure‚Äù style book
    - From Stanley to Everyone: (1:40 PM)
        - Joey you spittin RN - Roam removes friction from me thinking and allows me to keep all of the thoughts I‚Äôve put effort into
    - From Kristen Pavle to Everyone: (1:40 PM)
        - This is so rad, Luca! Building off of a book in Roam with your own notes - yep this makes perfect sense! Nicole - good call! Choose your own adventure!!
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:40 PM)
        - LOVE having books in Roam format ‚Äî HUGE added utility for pulling the concepts
    - From Me to Everyone: (1:40 PM)
        - Roam gives the author of a book a chance to customize to lots of different readerships at the same time, so cool
    - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (1:40 PM)
        - Building blocks‚Ä¶ Roam in a nutshell
    - From Andy Goodman to Everyone: (1:41 PM)

        - +1 building blocks, Beau
    - From Stanley to Everyone: (1:41 PM)
        - referencing book in Roam == fire...block references in a book adds all the thoughts in a book into your brain...thats sooo amazing
    - From Stanley to Everyone: (1:41 PM)
        - Block Refs + Books == a lowered bar to intelligence
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:41 PM)
        - Easily add fleeting notes WITH CONTEXT
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:41 PM)
        - one day, ALL books will be in Roam (my wish)
    - From Me to Everyone: (1:42 PM)
        - I love this, book as a map of a territory, not a linear path
    - From Joshua Butler to Everyone: (1:42 PM)
        - Yeah the context really helps, especially in an academic sense, rather than having to note down everything for references
    - From Stanley to Everyone: (1:42 PM)
        - if all books had references to the supporting thoughts
    - From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:42 PM)
        - How does one purchase this book in Roam?
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:42 PM)
        - We need better ways of publishing (particularly nicely formatted publishing) FROM Roam. I‚Äôm sure there will be many possibilities once we have an official Roam API
    - From Juan Caicedo to Everyone: (1:42 PM)
        - @Luca we can hear you fine, no need to hold your mic üòÄ
    - From Stanley to Everyone: (1:42 PM)

    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:42 PM)
        - Roam books + ‚ÄúHow to Read a Book‚Äù = good match (author?)

        - Filters Love
    - From Andy Henson to Everyone: (1:43 PM)
        - @Matt - yes! I‚Äôd love to see multiple paths through the book - each reader can blaze their own path and if others could then follow that path, that would be really interesting
    - From Stanley to Everyone: (1:43 PM)
        - this is sooo dope
    - From Me to Everyone: (1:43 PM)
        - Yeah the filtering this is actually pretty amazing for publishing books
    - From @Nico_Macdonald (LDN) to Everyone: (1:44 PM)
        - @Luca: Your book model is fabulous
    - From Me to Everyone: (1:44 PM)
        - It‚Äôs like having an infinite number of overlay sheets you can apply to the text
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:44 PM)
        - @Andy ‚Äî this reminds me of @RobertHaisfields work on the user journey through content.
    - From Tory to Everyone: (1:44 PM)
        - What would prevent a single buyer of the book with ill intentions to export the json/md and share it freely? (From an author‚Äôs pov, just curious)
    - From Stanley to Everyone: (1:44 PM)
        - once we are able to reference blocks from other graphs
    - From Kristina Wolter to Everyone: (1:44 PM)
        - @Luca - how might someone keep track of what they read and what is still remaining?  I can imagine someone could get lost in this format
    - From Joshua Butler to Everyone: (1:45 PM)
        - Its like a children's chose your own adventure but with an academic focus instead
    - From Me to Everyone: (1:45 PM)
        - @kristina that‚Äôs a great question, bookmarks lose their meaning in a multidimensional space
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:45 PM)
        - @Joshua YES. Exactly that. CYOA reading
    - From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:45 PM)

        - Matt do you mind jumping in with a question from the chat?
    - From Joshua Butler to Everyone: (1:45 PM)
        - I suppose making the graph really clear, so you can see how you have navigated the book?
    - From Matthew McKinlay to Me: ([[Privately]]) (1:46 PM)
        - Hard to follow the chat at same time
    - From Me to Matthew McKinlay: ([[Privately]]) (1:46 PM)

        - This isn‚Äôt even end-game‚Ä¶ this is the 1st attempt at it inside of [[Roam]]‚Ä¶ let that sink in‚Ä¶. jeez
    - From Matthew McKinlay to Me: ([[Privately]]) (1:46 PM)
        - Do you want to ask it?
    - From Art Assoiants to Everyone: (1:46 PM)
        - Not even its final form
    - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (1:46 PM)
        - @art right!
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:46 PM)
        - @beau ‚Äî oh yea, I can 100% build on this design
    - From @Nico_Macdonald (LDN) to Everyone: (1:47 PM)
        - @Matt I think @Kristina‚Äôs question is significant as knowing what I have read of Smart Notes has become an issue, as usually I would highlight something on each page of a book and know from that if I had read it. But we can‚Äôt highlight the main text and thus it‚Äôs hard to do this. (I think we should discuss methods for keeping tabs on progress.)
    - From Beau Haan to Everyone: (1:47 PM)
        - Did he say 50!!!
    - From Art Assoiants to Everyone: (1:47 PM)

    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:47 PM)
        - Woah, that is a lot more room copies than I would expect as a % of sales
    - From Me to Matthew McKinlay: ([[Privately]]) (1:47 PM)
        - Sure! I have a couple. I‚Äôll raise my hand

        - does anyone use scrivener?. it feels a bit like a conflation of function. there‚Äôs research, there‚Äôs writing, and there‚Äôs publishing. luca has combined all three, right? the note taking/codiification of ideas is one piece but not all three. or am i overthinking this?
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:49 PM)
        - I use Scrivener‚Ä¶I was a heavy Scrivener user BR (Before Roam)
    - From Justin Johnson to Everyone: (1:50 PM)
        - Seems like opportunities for third party tools once the API is available
    - From Ed Marsh to Everyone: (1:50 PM)
        - @justin üëç
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:50 PM)
        - @edmarsh Scrivener offers the capability to do all of that, it depends on how you use it. It is very well suited for writing, research and publishing.
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:50 PM)
        - @Justin ‚Äî Yea, and strong conversion systems
    - From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:50 PM)
        - I used Scrivener for my dissertation. Or for the outline. Used Word for the final with Endnote.
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:51 PM)
        - @luca It‚Äôs really like writing two different books using the same starting content

    - From Mary Chipman to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
        - On amazon, get someone to write a review that mentions the web site to get the Roam version. They won't let you post a link (if I remember correctly) but getting a 5-star review right out of the gate really drives sales.
    - From Matthew McKinlay to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
        - Nice one Mary!
    - From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
        - FOMO for non-linear texts?
    - From Ed Marsh to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
        - feels to me like the key is to understand the goal. if it‚Äôs to pull together massive amounts of information and to pull the threads, I‚Äôm incredibly excited about roam, but publishing limits the audience - and the writing process feels to me to be a very different process.

        - Star it?
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
        - Hahaha yea. I‚Äôd love a hidden #read tag that you could place a ‚Äúfootprint‚Äù on the blocks
    - From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
        - Or to have breadcrumb trail where you know where you‚Äôve been.
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
        - Yes, the TOC fulfills that tracking function for me in a nonlinear book
    - From Shan Rauf to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
        - you could create a tag that marks blocks as read and then filter them out
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
        - good idea @shanrauf
    - From Mika Mauger to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
        - the tag idea is nice
    - From Fernando C. to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
        - What about using "Reactions" to track what you have read.
    - From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
        - I have some many use-cases of ‚Äúhidden tags‚Äù - This is one. #[[enhancement request]]
    - From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
        - You could also track a social ‚Äúpath‚Äù through the non-linear text.
    - From Justin Johnson to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
        - If Roam saved to a standard format (say the edn export became like a web standard or something) then you could work in Roam, export part of the graph to like a Scrivener-like tool that can manage its own internal graph with publishing specific tooling.
    - From Julia Walsh to Everyone: (1:53 PM)

        - I‚Äùve wondered this too, Kristina
    - From Joey Harris to Everyone: (2:01 PM)
        - Roam is built on top of a ‚Äúgraph database‚Äù which is not the same as the ‚Äúgraph overview‚Äù
    - From Kristina Wolter to Everyone: (2:01 PM)
        - @Joey - then are we asked to look through the daily notes?

        - One more thing that I really missed in working on daily prompts or discussion points from agenda is referencing to the prime (original) block. When I type () and search for ‚ÄúDefine a fleeting note in your own words‚Äù it shows quite a few blocks, without colour coding or nesting, so there‚Äôs no way to make sure I link to the one from the agenda (unless you copy it from there manually).

- 
- #Question [[@Matthew McKinlay]] from: [[Brandon Toner]]
    - Is there a link to the [[Otter.ai]] transcription so that we can request it? #[[Live Session 2]]
- From Jason Carman to Everyone: (1:24 PM)
    - ^^
- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"Come up with your own definition of [[fleeting notes]]? "
    - [[Beau Haan üìå]] #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[The fleeting note is the highest order of connectedness, captured, or else lost to the abyss]]
        - Ah, the most misunderstood of notes, the Fleeting variety
        - If I was going to define a word, I'd have to know it's usage and purpose, the way in which it serves it purpose, predicating that the written word has any meaning at all~
        - How is it used? 
            - As a mallet, a hammer? A way to describe your thoughts, an outlet for your mind to corroborate on the floating and ephemeral patterns of intuition that lead to an awakened sense of life.
            - The tool like aspect of these types of notes, is evident? I mean, if I had to say so, then sure, but there's something more behind the veil. There's a deeper purpose...
        - I still haven't answered the question, but the spark has been lit, the pilot-light is ablaze, there's something here, and I'd like to dig
        - When they say that there ought to be a place where you can place your every thought and idea into, I'm despising the word "bucket," but maybe that's the best way to describe something that catches all--including refuse.
            - I'm wandering from the topic.
        - Let's chip away at the purpose. It's to be able to align myself to what I had been ruminating on throughout the day, and each one of these little notes is supposed to be a building block of something much greater than it's initial seedling, sprouting from the concrete.
            - So it's a seed?
                - I'm not convinced, since there has to be fertile soil for seedlings to scratch into, and to develop
            - So a wave, like ripples?
                - Maybe, but that still looks like a forceful definition, so let's keep going.
            - So it's hope?
                - Sure, it's hope that the idea that has possessed me at that exact moment will see the light through the blinding realization that we are trained to not "see." 
                - As the reticular activating system kicks in over-drive, and the multitude of tasks begin crowding my every thought, what the fuck is the point of writing down some chicken-scratch to be reviewed at the end of the day?
                    - That means, that this moment has to be filled with something more than the usual "ooh~" and replaced with genuine "ah-hahs!"
                        - But is that right?
                        - Can't I just have a multitude of ideas that are percolating?
                            - I could.
                                - But I don't think that's it either.
            - So it's a light switch?
                - Does it turn on and off? Not sure
                - Does it illuminate? Absolutely
                    - So what gives light, but without switches
            - So it's a relationship?
                - I like that. I love the idea of relationships...
            - But what sort of relationship is tracked and thought of at the end of each night?
            - How can I produce an analogy that can empower me?
            - What else can I think of that represents the mysteriousness that shrouds this concept?
            - God? Some sort of higher power?
                - IF that conception holds true, then there has to be some sort of antithesis to that, in order to prove that this hold weight
                    - What would be the opposite force? 
                        - The opposite of a fleeting note? The opposite of a light source... the abyss...
                            - Woah... the abyss...
                                - That's why so many thoughts that flow into me are lost, because if they are not captured and made into light, or rather made from light, then the abyss consumes, and oh how the abyss consumes...
        - Then the answer is the opposite of the abyss. My definition is the opposite of the abyss, but what's the definition of abyss...
            - ‚Ä¢¬†a deep or seemingly¬†bottomless¬†chasm:¬†__a rope led down into the dark abyss__.¬†
‚Ä¢¬†a wide or profound difference between people; a gulf:¬†__the¬†__abyss between__¬†the two nations__.¬†
‚Ä¢¬†the regions of hell¬†conceived¬†of as a bottomless pit:¬†__Satan's dark abyss__.¬†
‚Ä¢¬†(the abyss)¬†a catastrophic¬†situation¬†seen as likely to occur:¬†__teetering on¬†__the edge of the abyss__¬†of a total political wipeout__.
            - Reversed...
        - ^^"The highest order of connectedness, captured, or else lost to the abyss" ü§Ø^^
            - I'm happy with that definition... that was a bitch to unravel, but worth it~
    - [[Alex Shchedrin]] Fleeting notes are captured temporary reminders of thoughts, questions, and ideas that appeared in our consciousness. The capture process needs to be as frictionless as possible (not to disrupt the flow of reading or listening). You also need to trust that you will (1) process them eventually and (2) when processing will still remember the thought, question or idea enough to consider turning it into a permanent note. (also related to [reflection on phase 1](((ZbAlynTq-))))
    - [[Myles Orme]]
        - I find the name evocative, and I love the description of them as notes to remind you of the thoughts as being very helpful But of course they are only good for as long as I can remember what it is that I was thinking about and that is not long. 
        - All thoughts expressed in language are memories. We have the thought, then we verbalise it and then we grab a pen and start writing something and find we have lost the energy and whilst we struggle with that we loose the sense of what it was we were thinking.
        - The irony is that the more fascinating I find a book (of non-fiction) the more I am likely to ruminate and write my own notes and the less momentum I am likely to build and the more likely it is that I get lost or distracted. Novels I sit and read in great swathes and with total abandon, I live in them and they live in me. Allowing myself to read without bothering much with notes, with the scheduled intention to return to note it properly later has been liberating.
- From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:24 PM)
    - That was excellent!
- #Chat [[Siva Arunagiri]] [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] talks about using [[zettelkasten]] numbers but I think we wouldn‚Äôt need those numbers on [[Roam Research]]. What do you all think about it? 
    - #Reply-from [[Matt McKinlay]] Great question Siva! I have been thinking about the same.  My thoughts- 
        - I don't think a numbered system is required or would be useful. 
            - Roam generates IDs automatically at block level (amazing) and I think numberered system would primarily be an equivalent/competing ID system.
            - Bi-directional links on both pages are the equivalent too of a numbered system. 
            - Creating a numbered system adds extra overhead and potential confusion to implement collectively.
                - #Reply-from [[Siva Arunagiri]] this is exactly what I was thinking as well. Numbering would just add extra overheads and like you have said about Bi-directional links would do the trick of connecting notes. 
                - #Reply-from [[Denise Todd]] I also believe that using both the bidirectional linking AND a numbering system adds a potential for error (thus confusion) as the bidirectional links may link to somewhere different from the numbering system. And, wait for it... the numbering by the human would cause that discrepancy. 
        - However, it promotes sequence in the development of zettels
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] This IS [[Folgezettel]]
            - Benefit of a numbered system is that it promotes sequence between notes. 
                - e.g. Can see not only links between notes, but numbered sequences so can see in what order notes became linked
                - But, I still think we can achieve the sequence with noting dates explicitly, e.g. on date picker, as well as automatically by using daily notes. 
                    - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] Great point. If one is able to design a workflow to construct their [[Zettelkasten]] from the Daily Notes page, then the sequencing would be automatic.
        - I would like to experiment with a template for zettels though, which would have an attribute for links to other notes. 
    - #Reply-from [[Alex Shchedrin]] There is something beautiful in simplicity of proximity relationship between notes, i.e. note 1a and 1a1 and 1a2 are all related in a cluster, and it is visible with the alphanumeric system. 
        - I wonder if instead of numbers the sequence/proximity relationship could be achieved in [[Roam]] with block referencing (or perhaps embedding) permanent notes on a single page in an outline format, in addition to other means to connect notes, such as block references and tags.
        - I am still developing this idea or mapping tools available within Roam to the workflow that would be the most natural and simple to me.
    - #Reply-from[[Bart Lubaszka]] I've been thinking about this as well.
        - Against:  
            - I think Roam takes care of numbering and linking for us and so adding another naming convention would simply add more resistance to taking notes
                - This is enough for me. The numbering system alone is enough to keep me away from the slip box method, so not having to use it is amazing for me
        - For: 
            - [[S√∂nke Ahrens]] does explicitly mention that one reason for the numbering convention is for the future proofing of the system. I can't find mention of this in the book just now on [[November 11th, 2020]] so I wonder if I read this somewhere else as it relates to Zettlekasten?
                - What happens if we choose to export our entire slipbox for whatever reason? Do the connections remain? The notes with titles will, and the links will remain as text. There will be no way to put the notes in any usable order, however. 
                - Let's say we chose to print it--forget it! But I wouldn't ever intent on this doing that unless there was to be an apocalyptic event. 
                - If we export to Obsidian, we would be fine. But what other program exists in which this would be fine? 
                    - Exporting to bear would require converting brackets to hashtags. Is this enough? 
- From Me to Everyone: (1:25 PM)
    - By the way guys feel free to put stuff here in the group chat and I will copy-paste it into the main graph for later reference
- #Chat [[Siva Arunagiri]] probably a noob question: How are you all reviewing your highlights and turning them into permanent notes? How are you all writing permanent notes? Are they separate notes, which sometimes might overload the system or are they into different topics and such? 
    - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] As of now, my permanent notes are separate pages that have a "Z:" prefix. 
        - For example, "Z: The American economy entered its current period of stagnation starting in the 1970's".
            - The Z: prefix has the advantage of distinguishing permanent notes from other types of notes.
                - I am not yet convinced this is a long-term solution.
                    - Does a [[Zettel]] title prefix (i.e. "Z:") scale well for thousands of permanent notes?
    - #Reply-from [[Nicole Drumhiller]] All of my highlights are in the physical book. From here I've created literature notes but have placed these into #Zotero. For my permanent notes, I've created a section on my page and outlined the book and then have written out things in a manner that they are in permanent form, but I'm still struggling with the best way to save these in my own graph for future use. Basically, I'm trying to figure out what a permanent slip-box would look like in Roam.
        - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] I am trying to figure out the same thing. Keeping one's [[Literature Note]]s in a separate system like [[Zotero]] is an interesting option, because it seems to align with the way [[Luhmann]] constructed his own [[Zettelkasten]].
            - #Reply-from [[Nicole Drumhiller]] in my mind keeping them separate will help prevent "clutter" and will prevent me from saving absolutely everything. I think the skill I've been working on the most is quality over quantity. 
    - #Chat [[Jason Caro]] What are the advantages of having separate [[Literature Note]] and [[Permanent Note]] systems like [[Zotero]]? What are the drawbacks?
        - #Reply-from [[Siva Arunagiri]] for people wanting a clear referencing system would want a system like  Zotero!
        - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] while I can‚Äôt speak to Zotero, I can say that my understanding of a [[Literature Note]] is one that has closer ties to the original text (yet one step removed through phrasing in your own words). A permanent note captures more independent thinking across all arguments as it exists in your slip box - it is more atomic. I can see why it might be valuable to have #traceability from permanent to literature notes so I can‚Äôt speak to this yet as I am trying to stay about the ‚Äútool‚Äù conversation until my slip box is implemented.
            - some thoughts from [[Joel Chan]]: "The fleeting note is a bit more nebulous for me. For me, fleeting notes are the "[chaos stream](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/roamfm/joel-chan-knowledge-0CcxF23g1OS/)" or "magic junkyard". They're like the sparks and hunches that could coalesce into a **literature note **(a cogent distillation of a contextualized claim from a source) or a **zettel/persistent/evergreen note** (a cogent distillation of a generalizable idea that I might use as a building block for synthesis)"
    - #Reply-from [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]] I'm starting a page for permanent notes and then using a textexpander script to automatically label this as a permanent note. This is a work in progress. Here's the script:
        - - [[permanent notes]]
        - - Source:
        - - Keywords:
        - - Relevant notes:
        - - My notes
        - - Questions
- From Jason Carman to Everyone: (1:25 PM)
    - Ok matt, about to dump
- #Chat [[Jason Caro]] Does anyone use title prefix conventions to distinguish between different types of notes?
    - I currently use the following prefixes:
        - Z: Permanent Note
        - L: Literature Note
        - Q: Open Question
        - H: Hypothesis
        - T: Theory
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] Although this way of distinction is effective, I think there's a more powerful way of approaching this within [[Roam]]
                - I'm of the opinion that the questioning and hypothesizing is actually part of the [[Zettelkasten]] process, so as the `Permanent Notes` continue to build one after the next, that questioning, supporting, and undermining happens naturally as part of the way this system works
                    - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] This definitely resonates.
                - How else would it? If I am adding notes in a nested sequence that gives me a sense of dialogue then the conversation has to build, negate, support, and expand just like if it was happening with another person, but this system uses those same principles but with the most interesting person we know--__ourselves__
    - "The Z: prefix has the advantage of distinguishing permanent notes from other types of notes."
        - "I am not yet convinced this is a long-term solution."
            - "Does a [[Zettel]] title prefix (i.e. "Z:") scale well for thousands of permanent notes?"
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] I'm leaning towards hashtags for this purpose simply because they are more fluid and merge-able later
        - #Reply-from [[Denise Todd]] [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] can you please expand on what you mean my "merge-able later" ??
        - #Reply-from [[Kate Foy üå±]] I use an emoji in the title - I see it quickly - and reference the natural world from seedling to branch to tree. Eccentric, maybe, but it works for me. I'm a visual kinda gal. üòÄ
            - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] This is an interesting approach, as I sometimes find myself getting tired of seeing a bunch of "Z:"s and "Q:"s in the titles. An emoji element could be a cool option! üòé
        - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] I hear you on using something that will be more "fluid and merge-able" later.  Roam's future roll-outs of [[attributes]] and search [[filtering]] features could make title [[prefixes]] obsolete. 
            - For now, the main advantage of using title [[prefixes]] seems to be during [[inline tagging]].
                - In the middle of writing a note, one can type a double-bracket, a "Q:", and a key-word. They then see all of their open questions related to that key-word.
                    - I'm not sure if this will scale well to thousands of notes, but for now it presents the ability to do "filtering on the fly" without leaving the body of a note.
        - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] I suppose another fundamental question is if [[title prefixes]] limit the human mind's journey toward insight?
            - Does putting notes into "categories" limit the [[openness]] of the [[Zettelkasten]] system?
                - Does the mind become distracted by title prefixes or can they be paid attention to only when they are relevant and helpful?

- #Chat [[Siva Arunagiri]] how are you managing references of what you are reading? 
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I have things as automated as possible, so the sources are usually captured as the `Title` within my [[Otter.ai]] voice-memo captures
        - This is ~~easily~~ possible with Siri Shortcuts and a little google searching to find out ways to filter words out from the iOS clipboard

            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] I really stand behind the power of the [[Daily Notes]] page, and the ease in which others can actually interact with you without having to deep-dive into other's personal pages, although they can too~
                - Certain conventions have berthed from trial and error including:

- #Chat [[Edvardo Archer]] I have come across several passages of the book that has refined my knowledge of what [[The Slip-box is **NOT**]]. What are the notes you are taking to help you understand what it is and isn't?
    - As an extension of our own memory, the slip- box is the medium we think in, not something we think about
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] This is such a powerful sentence, because it contextually reframes the idea of note-taking from--containing information to wrestling with knowledge
        - "As the slip-box is not a book with just one topic, we don‚Äôt need to have an overview of it. On the contrary, we are much better off accepting as early as possible that an overview of the slip-box is as impossible as having an overview of our own thinking while we are thinking. As an extension of our own memory, the slip-box is the medium we think in, not something we think about. The note sequences are the clusters where order emerges from complexity. We extract information from different linear sources and mix it all up and shake it until new patterns emerge. Then, we form these patterns into new linear texts."
            - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] really well said Edvardo.
- #Chat [[Brandon Toner]] How should indentation be used with books published in Roam format? 
    - #Question [[Luca Dellanna]]
        - "[[indentation]] is a core function of [[Roam]] to infer relationships between blocks (and ideas). By using indentation intentionally, you can change the reading experience quite significantly. "
            - If you were to redesign the **structure** of [[Ergodicity]], would you change anything? Why?

    - Who's right? [[Beau Haan]] {{[[slider]]}} [[Stanley]]
    - 
    - How do you define fleeting notes?
        - [[Beau Haan]] Any thought I have while consuming content that seems remotely interesting or relevant.
            - [[Jason Carman]] Do you think flashcard versus a computer changes the way the [[fleeting notes]] process works.
            - [[Stanley]] only highlighted and moved on. 
                - I personally experienced this to be a much easier way to read. 
        - [[Beau Haan] What isn't a [[fleeting note]]?
        - [[Stanley]] 
            - felt that [[Sonke]] was very ambiguous on purpose.
            - Rules For Fleeting Notes
            - Anything that if it were to disappear tomorrow I wouldn't be too sad. 
            - Anything that is effortful disqualifies from it being a [[fleeting note]]
            - A jot during a conference call is a fleeting note. 
            - Thinking and writing is a skill, the way you focus on things gets better as we do it on purpose. 
            - Feels we have a weakness when it comes to writing as it relates to [[memes]] and [[emojis]]
        - [[Beau Haan]] 
            - uses Siri to Otter voice memo everything. 
            - It has to be habitual.
            - The dialogue that comes from your core. This sets up the [[zettelkasten]] to be personalized to allow you to have a dialogue with yourself, long term. 
            - The [[fleeting note]] is the highest order of connectedness before it's lost into the abyss. 
                - [[Stanley]] felt the opposite that the [[fleeting note]] was the lower denominator of thought. They are fleeting therefore they don't have value.
                    - [[Jason Carman]] I added that there are many moments in life we won't remember, the fact that it's fleeting doesn't de-value it. I argued that was the whole purpose of the fleeting note was to capture something we normally wouldn't. 
                - [[Sergey]]
                    - Writing in your own words makes you "know" your context.
                - [[Charles Farr]]
                    - Sees fleeting notes as a gradient. Highlights are a form of [[fleeting note]] there is significant difference between that and your own thought.
- From Jeremie Rykner to Everyone: (1:27 PM)
    - Interesting discussion in our breakout session as we had a few academics, to hear how they see Sonke 3 part process of note taking

- From Me to Everyone: (1:33 PM)
    - Brandon‚Äôs point that ‚Äúfleeting‚Äù has a different meaning on paper; roam is a one of a kind environment that allows the note to persist forever

- From StephanC to Everyone: (1:34 PM)
    - @Kristina I use Draft app
- From Gene Z to Everyone: (1:34 PM)

- From Mary Chipman to Everyone: (1:36 PM)
    - Signal-to-Noise -- fleeting notes have terrific potential to heavily weight the Noise part of that equation if you just indiscriminately dump every fleeting note into Roam and then forget it.

    - How does one purchase this book in Roam?

- From @Nico_Macdonald (LDN) to Everyone: (1:47 PM)
    - @Matt I think @Kristina‚Äôs question is significant as knowing what I have read of Smart Notes has become an issue, as usually I would highlight something on each page of a book and know from that if I had read it. But we can‚Äôt highlight the main text and thus it‚Äôs hard to do this. (I think we should discuss methods for keeping tabs on progress.)

    - does anyone use scrivener?. it feels a bit like a conflation of function. there‚Äôs research, there‚Äôs writing, and there‚Äôs publishing. luca has combined all three, right? the note taking/codiification of ideas is one piece but not all three. or am i overthinking this?
- From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:49 PM)
    - I use Scrivener‚Ä¶I was a heavy Scrivener user BR (Before Roam)
- From Justin Johnson to Everyone: (1:50 PM)
    - Seems like opportunities for third party tools once the API is available
- From Ed Marsh to Everyone: (1:50 PM)
    - @justin üëç
- From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:50 PM)
    - @edmarsh Scrivener offers the capability to do all of that, it depends on how you use it. It is very well suited for writing, research and publishing.
- From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:50 PM)
    - @Justin ‚Äî Yea, and strong conversion systems
- From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:50 PM)
    - I used Scrivener for my dissertation. Or for the outline. Used Word for the final with Endnote.
- From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:51 PM)
    - @luca It‚Äôs really like writing two different books using the same starting content
- From Beau Haan to Everyone: (1:51 PM)
    - The CSS is subtle and beautiful~
- From Mary Chipman to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
    - On amazon, get someone to write a review that mentions the web site to get the Roam version. They won't let you post a link (if I remember correctly) but getting a 5-star review right out of the gate really drives sales.
- From Matthew McKinlay to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
    - Nice one Mary!
- From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
    - FOMO for non-linear texts?
- From Ed Marsh to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
    - feels to me like the key is to understand the goal. if it‚Äôs to pull together massive amounts of information and to pull the threads, I‚Äôm incredibly excited about roam, but publishing limits the audience - and the writing process feels to me to be a very different process.

- From Beau Haan to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
    - Star it?
- From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
    - Hahaha yea. I‚Äôd love a hidden #read tag that you could place a ‚Äúfootprint‚Äù on the blocks
- From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
    - Or to have breadcrumb trail where you know where you‚Äôve been.
- From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
    - Yes, the TOC fulfills that tracking function for me in a nonlinear book
- From Shan Rauf to Everyone: (1:52 PM)
    - you could create a tag that marks blocks as read and then filter them out
- From Joey Harris to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
    - good idea @shanrauf
- From Mika Mauger to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
    - the tag idea is nice
- From Fernando C. to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
    - What about using "Reactions" to track what you have read.
- From Brandon Toner to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
    - I have some many use-cases of ‚Äúhidden tags‚Äù - This is one. #[[enhancement request]]
- From Dan Allosso to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
    - You could also track a social ‚Äúpath‚Äù through the non-linear text.
- From Justin Johnson to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
    - If Roam saved to a standard format (say the edn export became like a web standard or something) then you could work in Roam, export part of the graph to like a Scrivener-like tool that can manage its own internal graph with publishing specific tooling.
- From Julia Walsh to Everyone: (1:53 PM)
    - I keep trying Scrivener, but just wish there was a good way of including academic citations with it.

    - For a non-linear book you‚Äôd want to check off blocks you‚Äôve read instead of chapters.
- From Kristina Wolter to Me: (Privately) (1:54 PM)

    - Q: Why do we call this section a 'graph' yet there is a 'graph overview'... confused with the terms
- From Art Assoiants to Everyone: (2:01 PM)
    - Seems like a legacy decision
- From Julie Freyberg to Everyone: (2:01 PM)
    - I‚Äùve wondered this too, Kristina
- From Joey Harris to Everyone: (2:01 PM)
    - Roam is built on top of a ‚Äúgraph database‚Äù which is not the same as the ‚Äúgraph overview‚Äù
- From Kristina Wolter to Everyone: (2:01 PM)
    - @Joey - then are we asked to look through the daily notes?
- From Lindsey Johnston to Everyone: (2:02 PM)

    - How do you filter the graph?
- From Jeremie Rykner to Everyone: (2:18 PM)
    - Filter, Click the Filter icon next to the search bar
- From Mika Mauger to Everyone: (2:18 PM)
    - there is no Filter icon when you are in Graph Overview :/
- From Casey Gollan to Everyone: (2:18 PM)
    - Yeah, I‚Äôm not seeing it!
- From Jason Carman to Everyone: (2:19 PM)
    - That sounds great
- From Gleb Reys to Everyone: (2:19 PM)
    - One more thing that I really missed in working on daily prompts or discussion points from agenda is referencing to the prime (original) block. When I type () and search for ‚ÄúDefine a fleeting note in your own words‚Äù it shows quite a few blocks, without colour coding or nesting, so there‚Äôs no way to make sure I link to the one from the agenda (unless you copy it from there manually).

    - Hi, yes I did that with ‚Äútext and alias‚Äù like Matt was showing
- From @Nico_Macdonald (LDN) to Everyone: (2:28 PM)
    - @Matt: Replace with text and alias also allows you to highlight the source text, which others will then be able to see.
