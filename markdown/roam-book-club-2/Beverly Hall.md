- #[[Literature Notes]] [[The Four Underlying Principles]] [[Chapter 7. Nobody Ever Starts From Scratch]]
    - The practice of thinking through writing facilitates understanding.  
        - Rather than forcing topics and assertions into slots of particular arguments or outcomes which don't tend to fit, topics and assertions arise organically and spontaneously and the right arguments and outcomes follow.
        - Informed, interesting questions naturally emerge
            - These are questions that can and should be continually revisited, refined, and elevated
        - A sense of dialogue, rather than stilted argument, develops -- with a goal of  encouraging the reader's thought on the topic and, ultimately, the reader's understanding of the facts and assertions presented 
    - If pivoting to a different topic becomes necessary, it is not a burn it to the ground / throw it all in the trash event.  It is an acceptable part of the process.
    - #[[Fleeting Notes]]
        - But those who have already developed their thinking through writing can keep the focus on what is interesting for them at the moment and accumulate substantial material just by doing what they most feel like doing. The material will cluster around the questions they returned to most often, so they donâ€™t risk too far of a departure from their interest. If your first chosen topic turns out to be not as interesting, you will just move on and your notes will cluster around something else. Maybe you will even note down the reasons why the first question is not interesting and turn that into an insight valuable enough to make public. When it finally comes to the decision on what to write about, you will already have made the decisionâ€“because you made it on every single step along the way, again and again every day, improving it gradually. Instead of spending your time worrying about finding the right topic, you will spend your time actually working on your already existing interests and doing what is necessary to make informed decisionsâ€“reading, thinking and writing. By doing the work, you can trust that interesting questions will emerge. You might not know where you will end up (and you donâ€™t need to), but you canâ€™t force insight into a preconceived direction anyway. You minimise both the risk of losing interest in a topic you have once chosen ill-informed and the risk of having to start all over again. [*](((F-jhYj-Pz)))

- "It seems to me that a persistent idea might be better framed as a question. At some point it might start to look like an assertion. And then at some point, would all related questions be nested under the assertion?"
    - "#Reply-from [[Brandon Toner]] I agree! [[assertions]] are a maturity step in my notes. Almost everything starts as an idea, or a question. As those accumulate I form [[opinions]]. And eventually, those opinions strengthen. [[@[[Jason Kleinberg ðŸŽ»]]]] #[[My Zettelkasten Workflow]]

I use `#[[Zettel Questions]]` to address this. Feeling better about this very thing this week. And had a great day in the [[zettelkasten]] in my personal database. I'll be reflecting further on that in here. 

Here is my working array of note tags. 

[[reference notes]] â€” the bibliographic material and direct highlights

[[seedlings]] â€” bits of original inspiration, loose in format and tone-of-voice. More informal. 

[[fleeting notes]] â€” [[assertions]] start here. These are statements and claims. But not well thought out, yet.

[[literature notes]] â€” these are summaries of the author's main points. In my own words.

[[evergreen notes]] or [[permanent notes]] â€” these are the accumulation of [[fleeting notes]], [[seedlings]], and [[literature notes]] into a stronger idea [[synthesis]]. Densely linked and referenced, ideally. This is peak maturity of an [[atomic idea]].

[[zettel questions]] â€” these are questions I think of. Captured curiosities. Anything I'm wondering about. This may get noisy and I may need a tier for refined questions. Not yet, though.

[[project ideas]] â€” writing & creative projects â€” where I put the [[zettelkasten]] to work.

[[queries]] â€” this is where I find stray notes of these categories from around my database to gather the originals back here. Most of these notes form in some other [[context]].

    - [[Introduction]]
- "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?" 
    - Deciding concepts to use for literature notes
    - Knowing that the literature notes should lead to a good permanent note
        - Literature notes require time, care, and dedication
    - Sometimes jumping directly to preparing a literature note rather than starting with one or more fleeting notes and trusting the process
    - Knowing that the literature notes I have now are not a complete representation of the ideas and concepts they present
- [*](((x5hx3y9ay)))  Change must be acknowledged and respected in order to implement good habits and, ultimately, change.  This is a potentially tricky concept because we're accustomed to relying on previously engrained habits which we feel confident in and in control of.  Actually, the opposite is true.  We are actually less in control of those habits.
