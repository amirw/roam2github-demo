    - [[Introduction]]
        - “Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.”
        - “With that in mind, it is not surprising that the single most important indicator of academic success is not to be found in people’s heads, but in the way they do their everyday work”
            - I would comment all success, not just academic
        - “Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play.”
