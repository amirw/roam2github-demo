    - [[Goals for Book Club]]
        - Improve my usage of [[Roam Research]] through taking smart notes
        - Review what I've read and then finish reading "How to take smart notes."
        - Determine if I need to use a paper based note taking system or if the software based Roam will work for me.
        - Reflect upon and discuss techniques for synthesis of reading material into my own ideas, in writing and oral argument.
        - Improve retention of information I read.
        - Determine if I should start using Kindle and the corresponding note taking apps.
        - Use this Book Club to develop a routine.
