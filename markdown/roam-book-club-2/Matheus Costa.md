    - [[Introduction]]
        - The available books fall roughly into two categories. The first teaches the formal requirements: style, structure or how to quote correctly. And then there are the psychological ones, which teach you how to get it done without mental breakdowns and before your supervisor or publisher starts refusing to move the deadline once more. What they all have in common, though, is that they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper.[1] But by doing this, they ignore the main part, namely note-taking, failing to understand that improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference. They seem to forget that "the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development." This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and interconnected notes along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But most of all, you can write every day in a way that brings your projects forward. [*](((baDCUDIxD)))
            - Write interconnected notes to:
                - write efficiently
                - have fun
                - generate ideas
                - learn
                - write with purpose.
            - the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development.
        - "Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work." And maybe that is the reason why we rarely think about this writing, the everyday writing, the note-taking and draft-making. Like breathing, it is vital to what we do, but because we do it constantly, it escapes our attention. But while even the best breathing technique would probably not make much of a difference to our writing, any improvement in the way we organise the everyday writing, how we take notes of what we encounter and what we do with them, will make all the difference for the moment we do face the blank page/ screen–or rather not, as those who take smart notes will never have the problem of a blank screen again. [*](((NOUeE9wbB)))
            - Writing is not what follows research, learning or studying, it is the medium of all this work.
        - Writing strategies are not considered as something you can tinker with in order to influence the writing process because of the big delay between the input (the writing activity) and the output (the final product). [*](((1NqxVWlvh)))
            - Also, it is easy to think that changing your writing hours or how many pages you write per day will influence the probability of finishing the final product. It is not easy to think about how to go on about the writing process itself. More than not being easy, this is not something that people consider at all.
                - Quantitative measures are easier to perceive that qualitative measures.
        - Writing productively (and without stress) is a long-term activity, made up of frequent, small, well-defined steps[*](((VQiKWP6bz)))
            - "Recommended procedure:"
                - "Read, note, link. Read, note, link. Read, note, link. "
                    - "this is more like [spaced practice](https://www.moedu-sail.org/portfolio-items/spaced-vs-massed-practice/#:~:text=Massed%20Practice%20refers%20to%20conditions,intervals%20within%20the%20practice%20sessions.)"
        - In Academia, after a certain point, [[self-discipline]] is more important than [[IQ]][*](((KqvBsDubC)))
        - Luckily, this is not the whole story. We know today that self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves (cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed. Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. "Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long-and short-term interests. "Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success. This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play. [*](((tIetkYe5Q)))
            - Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long-and short-term interests. 
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - A good structure for non-fiction [[writing]] is a system that breaks the writing process into small, well-defined parts, where in each part the only concern is with the content and arguments of the topic or problem of interest. [*](((N9B8GYzJr)))
            - What to write next should be guided by your interest at the moment, and these will be influenced by what you are reading, writing and understanding, and by the new ideas that arise in this process.
            - A structure for [[writing]] like this, consists of a bundle of habits that you can [[trust]] to carry you to your goals.
                - The first habit is to engage in the process daily (or frequently).
                    - Reading every time you don't have what to write is the second habit.
                    - The second is to take notes in your own words.
                    - The third is to link the note being written with previous ones.
                    - Each of these habits is embedded in the previous one. And as a matter of [[Deliberate Practice]], each can be exercised independently.
                - An important component for habit formation is the [[belief]] or [[trust]] that the habit is useful and feasible. This idea is from [[Charles Duhigg]]'s [[The power of habit]]. As an illustration for this point, which I probably read in the same book is the story of a baseball coach that improved the performance of his team implementing a collection of habits. However the performance of the team only improved when the players bought into the effectivity of the habits. 
        - Don't draw a plan, set a structure up. [*](((e5t8EGtoY)))
            - For open-ended activities such as [[writing]], plans are restrictive, 
                - and require willpower, when the motivation that drew the plan vanishes.
            - Focus on the [[process]], not the [[product]].
        - "Good students, on the other hand, constantly raise the bar for themselves as they focus on what they haven’t learned and mastered yet. This is why high achievers who have had a taste of the vast amount of knowledge out there are likely to suffer from what psychologists call imposter syndrome, the feeling that you are not really up to the job, even though, of all people, they are (Clance and Imes 1978; Brems et al. 1994). This book is for you, the good students, ambitious academics and curious nonfiction writers who understand that insight doesn’t come easy and that writing is not only for proclaiming opinions, but the main tool to achieve insight worth sharing."

- Fleeting Notes::
    - "Everybody writes. Especially in academia. Students write and professors write. And nonfiction writers, who are the third group of people this book is aiming to help, obviously write as well. And writing doesn’t necessarily mean papers, articles or books, but everyday, basic writing. We write when we need to remember something, be it an idea, a quote or the outcome of a study. We write when we want to organise our thoughts and when we want to exchange ideas with others. Students write when they take an exam, but the first thing they do to prepare even for an oral examination is to grab pen and paper. We write down not only those things we fear we won’t remember otherwise, but also the very things we try to memorise. Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note."
