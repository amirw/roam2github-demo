    - [[Introduction]]
        - The available books fall roughly into two categories. The first teaches the formal requirements: style, structure or how to quote correctly. And then there are the psychological ones, which teach you how to get it done without mental breakdowns and before your supervisor or publisher starts refusing to move the deadline once more. What they all have in common, though, is that they start with a blank screen or sheet of paper.[ 1] But by doing this, they ignore the main part, namely note-taking, failing to understand that improving the organisation of all writing makes a difference. They seem to forget that the process of writing starts much, much earlier than that blank screen and that the actual writing down of the argument is the smallest part of its development. This book aims to fill this gap by showing you how to efficiently turn your thoughts and discoveries into convincing written pieces and build up a treasure of smart and ^^interconnected notes ^^along the way. You can use this pool of notes not only to make writing easier and more fun for yourself, but also to learn for the long run and generate new ideas. But most of all, you can ^^write every day in a way that brings your projects forward^^. [*](The available books fall roughly into two categories.

            - I am surprised of how similar [[Sönke Ahrens]] and [[Roam]]'s central ideas are!
        - here is another reason that note-taking flies mostly under the radar: ^^We don’t experience any immediate negative feedback if we do it badly.^^ But without an immediate experience of failure, there is also not much demand for help. And the publishing market working how it works, there is not much help in supply for this lack of demand either.^^ It is the panic in front of the blank screen that brings students and academic writers to turn to the bookshelves full of self-help books on writing,^^ a market publishers meet in droves by focusing on how to deal with this horse-has-already-left-the-barn situation. If we take notes unsystematically, inefficiently or simply wrong, we might not even realise it until we are in the midst of a deadline panic and wonder why there always seem to be a few who get a lot of good writing done and still have time for a coffee every time we ask them. And even then, it is more likely that some form of rationalization will cloud the view of the actual reason, which is most likely the difference between good and bad note-taking. “Some people are just like that,” “writing has to be difficult,” “the struggle is part of the deal” are just a few of the mantras that keep too many from inquiring what exactly distinguishes successful writing strategies from less successful ones.  [*](((1NqxVWlvh)))
            - No feedback is a real issue as [[everyday writing]] is the means to achieve an end (e.g. final essay or paper), as long as you have a good end result, nobody will care about your steps.
            - Although there is writing classes teaching the [[drafting]] steps (e.g. rough draft, revision etc), the central argument about [[How to Take Smart Notes]] is about, IMO, taking and organsing [[everyday writing]] 
        - To sum it up: ^^The quality of a paper and the ease with which it is written depends more than anything on what you have done in writing before you even made a decision on the topic.^^ [*](((-AeNlDTdF)))
            - It would be really nice if when writing my next paper, I suddenly found I have lots of resources written ready to be organised into use
            - It kinda depends on the duration of the writing project. If it is a long-term project, it is pretty natural that you could accumulate many useful pieces to assemble your final essay. 
                - What if it is a short-term writing project? #Questions
                    - I guess [[related]] and [[interconnected]] notes could help
        - Luckily, this is not the whole story. We know today that ^^self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our environment than with ourselves ^^(cf. Thaler, 2015, ch. 2) – and the environment can be changed. Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around. And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. ^^Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long-and short-term interests.^^ Having a meaningful and well-defined task beats willpower every time. Not having willpower, ^^but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success.^^ This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play. [*](((tIetkYe5Q)))
            - My recent experience resonates with it
                - when my task is well defined and meaningful, I am very motivated
                - I am a bit confused on what the long-and short-term interests refer to here... #Questions
    - [[Chapter 1. Everything You Need To Know]]
        - Until now, writing and note-taking techniques were usually taught without much regard to the overarching workflow. This book aims to change that. It will present you with the tools of note-taking that turned the son of a brewer into one of the most productive and revered social scientists of the 20th century. But moreover, it describes how he implemented them into his workflow so he could honestly say: “^^I never force myself to do anything I don’t feel like. Whenever I am stuck, I do something else.^^” A good structure allows you to do that, to move seamlessly from one task to another–without threatening the whole arrangement or losing sight of the bigger picture. [*](((59-bYYcu-)))
            - I wish I could hoping between tasks while being productive
        - As students, researchers and nonfiction writers, we have so much more freedom than others to choose what we want to spend our time on. Still, ^^we often struggle the most with procrastination and motivation. It is certainly not the lack of interesting topics, but rather the employment of problematic work routines that seems to take charge of us instead of allowing us to steer the process in the right direction.^^ A ^^good, structured workflow puts us back in charge and increases our freedom to do the right thing at the right time.^^ [*](((lz_jy3Uyg)))
