- A welcome from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]], key member of Book Club 1
    - Hi everyone, welcome to book club v 2.0!
        - This is our second "book club" and we are all learning as we go.
        - We're going to build this page out, to be able to orient newcomers, so bear with us!
    - Meanwhile here are some pointers
        - One of our shared conventions is that we ask that each user only write into two pages, unless expressly invited to do so by a moderator/admin.
    - Those two pages are the user's own "home page" (everybody can have one) and also the "Daily Notes" page (for whatever date it might be).
        - an exception to this would be if someone has started a # `chat` thread on their own page, in which case it is assumed that they want anyone to be able to join that chat.
        - for reasons of searchability and findability, though, we'd recommend you start a # `chat` within the Daily Notes page itself. 
    - For writing in your own page, please feel free to write whatever you want (within community guidelines)
    - For writing in the communal space, (i.e. the daily page), please take a look at the [[Chat guidelines]]
    - thanks - and kindly remember rule one of book club : "Be F#$ing Nice to Each Other".
    - if you haven't yet done so, please make a home page for yourself and link to it in the [[Directory]]
