- "(Getting the tools ready shouldn’t have taken more than 5-10 minutes. But having the right tools is only one part of the equation. It is easy to get fooled by their simplicity. Many “tried them out” without really understanding how to work with them and were expectedly disappointed with the results. Tools are only as good as your ability to work with them. Everybody knows how to handle a flute (you blow into one end and press your fingers on the holes according to the notes you are playing), but nobody would try it out once and then judge the instrument on what they hear.)"

- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]] "Should you delete your [[fleeting notes]] in a [[Roam]] [[zettelkasten]]?"
    1. [[Wade Dominic]]
        - In the old days it would have been difficult and impractical to keep fleeting notes. But now we can keep them as the space they consume is virtual. It is possible to hide them and ignore them easily. We can also flag ones that also present some kind of value and have them cluster randomly together in queries as mentioned [[November 8th, 2020]] in the call by [[Shana Pote]]
            - I rather like the definition of a fleeting note by [[Beau Haan 📌]] 
                - [[The fleeting note is the highest order of connectedness, captured, or else lost to the abyss]]
            - early 13c., "fickle, shifting, unstable," from Old English __fleotende__ "floating, drifting," later "flying, moving swiftly," from present participle of __fleotan__ "to float, drift, flow" (see [fleet](https://www.etymonline.com/word/fleet?ref=etymonline_crossreference#etymonline_v_38622) (v.)). Meaning "existing only briefly" is from 1560s. Related: __Fleetingly__. - https://www.etymonline.com/word/fleeting
                - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] #flowstate 🤯
                    - #Reply [[Wade Dominic]] Exactly. It is the thoughts that float across different literature/thinking. The pattern recognition. 
    2. [[Beau Haan 📌]]"Avoid the dreaded destruction of what stems from what's so pure, by being conscientiously discerning[*](((QP4Prmd3X))) because [[The fleeting note is the highest order of connectedness, captured, or else lost to the abyss]]"
        - Process Notes:: {{[[POMO]]: 5}}
            - Delete is such a strong word when describing anything that is written by our own hands. Let's see what the definition holds:
            - ^^late Middle English (in the sense ‘destroy’): from Latin __delet- __‘blotted out, effaced’, from the verb __delere__.^^
            - When do we "destroy" what was once built? When does an upheaval become required?
            - I think there's a sense of doom and dread around deleting something so pure it seems, especially in the beginning steps of this process
                - That's what I'm deterred from, that's what pulls me from such a strong word, but I also know that the early part of this learning process is exactly that. 
                    - Learning from what works, of course, but really diving into what does NOT
                - So...
                - To answer the question at hand, does the deleting of what fleets matter?
                - It's such a dichotomy because of the pain of sawing off what you have meticulously put together, mashing these thoughts with words in a sequence that provides sentences to summarize the inner-workings of the mind
            - My final answer, as the pomodoro timer ticks to let me know that I've surpassed my time...
            - IMHumbleO: 
                - Avoid the dreaded destruction of what stems from what's so pure, by being conscientiously discerning[*](((QP4Prmd3X))) because [[The fleeting note is the highest order of connectedness, captured, or else lost to the abyss]]
                    - ^^late Middle English: via Old French from Latin __discernere__, from __dis- __‘apart’ + __cernere __‘to separate’.^^
        - [[Alex Shchedrin]] in my personal graph I am exploring sending fleeting notes into the future with the delta function (alt + shift + enter on a Mac), and then reviewing and editing them the next day. Once edited, it is sent in the future again, and again, and again. Initially the wording may change, the details and connections may get added, at a later stage a related note may appear below. 
            - I am still figuring out that process, but something about sending a note to your future self is fascinating. 
                - I notice that I [keep writing about it](((sZXaBxGMn)))

- "#Question[[Mike Kramer]]{{alias:((WBqF2KHKp))Notes that aggregate permanent notes to give an overview of the structure of a topic are radically subject to revision. Is this also true of permanent notes, or are they inherently more stable?}}"
    - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] Great question. It reminds me of the debate right now between [[Andy Matuschak]]'s [[Evergreen Notes]] and [[Luhmann]]/[[Sonke]]'s [[Permanent notes]]. If you can even call it a debate.
        - Both types of notes demand atomicity, connectedness, and writing out ideas into your own words.
            - But the concept of Evergreen notes seems to emphasize the need for revision on an on-going basis while the concept of Permanent notes does not.
                - But is this a correct understanding of [[How To Take Smart Notes]]?
                    - Either way, I think your insight to emphasize exaptation helps frame an answer to the original question, though I'm afraid I might take this metaphor a bit too far.
                        - "But, a defining characteristic of a Zettelkasten (like the environment in a Darwinian theory) is that it is always changing. E.g."
                            - Does the transition of the feather from a thermal regulating feature to a flying feature require an update to the feather itself (i.e. the permanent note level) or simply an update to the way the existing feather interfaces with the whole (i.e. the overview note or connection linking level)?
                                - Or does updating one always necessitate updating the other?
                                    - I suspect it might be the latter in some cases.
        - 
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] Just posing a question here, but what if stability wasn't the outcome desired but rather a beautiful by-product of the entire conversation that's been taking place over time?
        - The change that happens in oneself is evident when we look back and reflect on our growth--the changes in behavior, the changes in attitude, the changes in how we look at the world, especially over time
        - What if this crazy thing called the [[Zettelkasten]] gave us that process[¹](((9aS1rMqBW))), sequenced[²](((yYDuEwcuw))), memorable[³](((qHNGHy04I))), and in our own words--truly a representation of our core being... whatever the hell that might be 🌳
- #Question [[Dan Allosso]] It came up in the Zoom convo yesterday, but I think it’s worth more thought before we move on: Does the potential permanence of the “fleeting” notes we put in Roam change their nature? Should we be adding note deletion to our workflow, if we want to create a useful and uncluttered graph? OTOH, does deletion limit the potential of serendipitous connections (as would be the case if, as [[@Beau Haan]] has suggested, they’re the purest intuitive thought-forms) we hadn’t planned or anticipated? 
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan 📌]] I was chatting into [[Wade Dominic]]'s page just now and came up with this analogy: 
        - "Think of it like being at a dinner party, the `Permanent Notes` is the thrilling conversation you're having with a mentor, while the `Intermediary Notes` are the milder chats with friends, and finally the `Fleeting Notes` could be considered the small-talk that "could" lead to something more akin to what you think of as important in YOUR life"
        - I think there's a definite relationship between all of the so-called __phases__, and those have to be seen in their entirety to make sense of what's happening individually
        - I just happen to prefer the analogous ideas of "dialogue" and "conversation" since it gives me a framework I already understand, taking the complex and making it simple?
    - #Reply [[Brandon Toner]] Dan, I added a writing prompt to the [[Writing Prompts]] page on this topic. I'd be interested to see group members reflect on that question so we could compile the ideas.
        - "Should you delete your [[fleeting notes]] in a [[Roam]] [[zettelkasten]]?"
    - #Reply[[Mike Kramer]]Dan, the case can be made that the more content that is in the network, the more combinations are possible, and the higher the likelihood of getting a good idea. 
My question, though, assumed we go by the book in how we deal with fleeting notes. I was wondering what happens if we discard the fleeting notes, once we have created the permanent notes. 
If topic overview notes that themselves are groupings of permanent notes should be considered easily revisable, what about the permanent notes that make up their components?
        - #Reply [[Dan Allosso]] I got the impression that the "atomic" permanent note was permanently valid, even if its web of connections changed. Even if a hypothesis is proven incorrect, it's still a hypothesis, right? The overview notes would constantly change, to the extent they were continuously-updated maps of the webs of connections. I've been looking at [[Luca Dellanna]]'s rBook. I installed the json version so I can "deface" it and look under the hood a bit. There's a determinism about the "pages" leading from start to finish but modified by not only the hyperlinks in the text but also the "unlinked notes" that are always available at the end and the search capability. I've messed with other apps like Storyscape in the past -- this seems to offer a more expansive model.
            - #Reply[[Mike Kramer]]I got a similar impression. After writing the initial question I began to consider some other points made in the book.
                - We don't generally want to use quotations since it is, in fact, more accurate to translate a quotation into our own personal forms of expression.
                - The underlying rationale is that meaning is relative to a larger system. The particular form of expressionthat an idea has in the system of the original text would express a different idea in the system of my Zettelkasten.
                - But, a defining characteristic of a Zettelkasten (like the environment in a Darwinian theory) is that it is always changing. E.g.
                    - new notes are added
                    - links among notes are continuously being added and deleted
                - From these ideas in the book, I conclude:
                    - the meaning of any word, or term, changes as my Zettelkasten system changes and
                    - the meaning of any sentence, or permanent note, changes as my Zettelkasten system changes
                - I also realized that this could be understood as the question of exaptation in a new guise. 
                    - Stephen Jay Gould came up with the word "exaptation," and only later did he realize that Nietzsche had a very similar concept in his treatment of the moral terms "good," "bad, and "evil" in his book __The Genealogy of Morals.__ 
                    - Nietzsche's point, which Gould discusses in his later work, was that the meaning of "good" is a function of human power relations, and as the systems of power change, the meaning of "good" changes. (In particular, people who once were called good, were the same people now called evil.)
                    - If this is true of the terms in our permanent notes, it would have to be true of the notes themselves.
                    - Following what [[Sönke Ahrens]] says about the importance of translating quotations when we incorporate the ideas that they express into our Zettelkasten system, we could make an analogous argument that we need to translate our year 2020 notes when we are tyring to use them in 2030, in a very different context.
- #Chat [[Beau Haan 📌]] I know `Queries` are a way to talk with oneself, but I also love the simplicity of not having to have a bunch of __questions__ cluttering up my `Personal Page`
    - So I created a `[[Name/Space]]` page like [[Beau Haan 📌/Zettels]] and added all of my notes there without having to filter, etc... 
    - Plus, the added benefit is that things "look" much more aesthetically pleasing when you "Click for references" inline when skimming through the book itself~
