    - We start with what we want to achieve, which is writing good texts. 
        - [[the succinct response to why make a [[Zettelkasten]] is: it breaks the hard task of writing good texts down into the satisfying tasks of writing notes and connecting notes]]
            - it's hard to write good texts. It is easier and more satisfying to do a little bit of writing at a time by requiring that ideas in notes be linked to other ideas in other notes at the moment of creation
    - We then give the summary of the means by which we achieve our goal:
        - [[the most succinct description of how to make a [[Zettelkasten]] is: read texts, write notes, link the notes]]
    - We then expand on this bare-bones summary by adding in the motivation. By adding the word "interesting" we highlight the fact that we are doing what we want to, or are motivated to, do.
        - [[the less succinct description of how to make a [[Zettelkasten]] is: read interesting texts, write interesting permanent notes, make interesting links among notes]]
