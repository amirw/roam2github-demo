- ### >#[[Daily Writing Prompt]] "What has been confusing or unclear in [[Roam Book Club 2]]?"
    1. [[Kate Foy üå±]] - nothing particularly confusing for me having read the book before RBC2 began and Sonke's book was made available in the graph - I'd used Readwise to import my highlights so didn't want to reproduce what I'd already done. For me the challenge was finding a process that worked as I worked through my "Fleets" to "Lits" to "Perms" (OK my shorthand but I think you'll get it - add your own terms in the spirit of individuality and diversity). Still working on the most efficient way and enjoying seeing the way others process their learning. Getting there.

I have felt overwhelmed by the numbers and the sync lag in the live sessions but this is minor and to be expected. The good thing is I persisted - that to me is the key and putting some [[digital gardening]] in my daily ToDo page was key to keeping up. I'm a believer in [[James Clear]] 's methodology of habit creation.

During RBC2 I've been "gardening" several books that I'm currently reading. Progress? Lots of Fleets being processed into Lits and the exciting thing is that it is at this stage that  ideas for Permanent Notes starts to spark. 

**It's keeping in mind process and not end-gaming that has worked for me. **
    2. OK I'll bite ([[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]) - I wouldn't exactly say I've felt anything to be confusing, but I do appreciate the learning curve. I mean I knew what I was getting into, having participated in v 1.0, so I wasn't necessarily expecting everything to be clear right away. 

That said, the one thing that became clear to me through the process of this book club is that there is no "single path" upwards through the heierarchy of fleeting --> literature --> zettels, and that's kind of the way I like it. 

I REALLY appreciate the focus on just one of these kinds of notes each week, was helpful from a learning perspective, but henceforward I think I'm going to be bolder about jumping in at the deep end with Zettels right from the start and just allow myself the freedom to adjust them, later. 

[[Beau Haan]]'s [[gas ‚Üí liquid ‚Üí solid]] metaphor really "clicked" with me, I think that's a wonderful way to conceptualize the process. Repeated heating and cooling, ideas moving from one phase to another and back again all the time. I think that's how this is supposed to work. 
    3. [[Beau Haan üìå]] I suppose the thing that has confused me most has been this lack of engagement outside of a core group of people. Just from what I know, and who I've met, there's so many people that have fascinating insights about this wacky thing called [[Zettelkasten]] that's not just appropriate--but incredibly helpful...
        - If only they would actively participate on the [[Daily Notes]] page, the [[Writing Prompts]], etc
        - I mean, the reasons why they want to build one, the illuminating moments they've experienced on this journey, all of that.
            - It's so powerful!!!
        - Maybe it's the speed of the shared graph, maybe it's the timidity of posting something for strangers, but maybe if there was a way to mingle a bit more, so we can openly engage with not just a core group, but this awesome network as a whole!
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] bravo! this is the value of [[public learning]] and [[digital gardening]]! and understandably, not everyone is comfortable sharing raw ideas in public - it‚Äôs a muscle memory and level of vulnerability that is learned/experienced over time - but this is part of the fun, I can‚Äôt tell you how motivated I am to shape thoughts faster or go back and clarify things because they are in public and you know someone is reading!
                - #quote An idea kept private is as good as one you never had. And a fact no one can reproduce is no fact at all. Making something public always means to write it down so it can be read. [*](((5Bxb_J2dj)))
        - I was just on an [[InterIntellect]] call just now, and the warmth of familiar faces populating the screen was helpful, but even the experiences over time, you could tell was engaging and something that I'd like to be part of even more
            - And I'm not saying the [[RoamBookClub]] is anything like a Salon, but maybe there's parts of what they're doing that could translate well, to the next iterations of this?
                - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] 100%. I don't think we can replicate the interintellect, nor should we try to, but I do think there's a fair amount that we can learn from Anna's basic model. 

Let's keep this in mind, throughout v 3.0!
    4. [[Ronaldo Batista]] Regarding the lack of engagement I feel guilty about that. I could've engaged daily with this awesome assembly of people and failed to do so, mostly for lack of enough commitment and time management but also I've felt a little intimidated I think on the few occasions I've followed and consumed the Daily Discussions. I didn't thought I had any insight to contribute
        - #[[Reply-from]] [[Matt McKinlay]]
            - Hey Ronaldo! Don't worry at all! Just great that you are part of it.  Totally understand life is busy and finding time to consistently read/write is not easy. Also know that the graph can be intimidating!  One of the cool things has been how interesting daily notes have become as a result of all the conversation and effort by others like [[Beau Haan]] [[Matt Brockwell]] [[Mike Kramer]] [[Chinarut]] [[Brandon Toner]]. Really loved it myself. But, also a lot of the time I come and read as well. 
                - As people become more familiar with process, as the process and standards themselves become more clear, posting will be easier etc. It's a big frontier at the moment, not really refined yet, and it's been great to see what happens.
    5. [[Nicole Drumhiller]] I've been just trying to not screw up the graph :) One of the things I'm looking forward to learning more about is what #Roam will do with all of this content moving forward. Since the process of creating #Zettles is specific to the individual
- [[Introduction]][*](((6JICDIMFX))) {{[[r/moved]]}} {{[[‚àÜ]]:1+2}}
- #Chat [[Chinarut]] anybody else noticing the rate in which they can produce new zettels slowing down? I think I created a grand total of 3 zettles over the course of 3 hours (prior, I was chugging at ~3 zettels per hour (3 zph down to 1 zph :)) and now it feels mindnumbing at times, I wanted to escape & just play some video games ÔøΩ

        - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] Me, just now... the time makes what's created worth it~ ![](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/firescript-577a2.appspot.com/o/imgs%2Fapp%2Froam-book-club-2%2FOkWAVfIBcg.png?alt=media&token=7b1c2384-6d31-490f-a484-93037aab325e)
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] so awesome - glad I‚Äôm not alone! üôåüèª
        - We are coached to have a dialogue with our slipbox and presence new ideas and after my first 30 zettels, it‚Äôs easy to get to a place when every time you look at a literature note, whatever you‚Äôre thinking is already in your slipbox!
        - So it takes some really intentional thinking to come up with something new.
        - This has been a blessing in disguise as it is leading me down paths I would have never expected (though my fleeting notes honestly hinted a zettel like this was coming! apparently we are the inception of the Gates of Roam theme camp! ;)
            - "#Zettels [[The function of money in The Burning Man Project is to acquire the resources and build the foundation required to organize and run an annual 1 week experiment capable of containing a gift economy of 70k people (as of 2019). A sustained 7-day experience of collective abundance (opposed to scarcity) permanently alters one‚Äôs experience of life and rewrites the future of the community]] z37"
    - #Reply-from [[Nicole Drumhiller]] I think if you go by the [[Luhmann]] philosophy the idea isn't to force your #Zettles. If I'm not mistaked I believe he was creating them at a rate of six per day and if something didn't come to him, he'd just move on to work on something else (S√∂nke 2017).  If you force it, it's likely that you'll push yourself into burnout where the idea is to develop a system that you can sustain overtime.  With that being said - go play those video games.  Chances are you'll get some good ideas from it.

- #Chat [[Ronaldo Batista]] I've just received from [[Tiago Forte]]'s newsletter an interesting book share  [[The Future of Text]], available for free at https://futuretextpublishing.com/future-of-text-2020-download/. Quoting from Tiago's newsletter: 'The Future of Text is "the largest survey of the future(s) of text ever undertaken," including a wide range of pieces exploring **how text might evolve in the future** to augment how we think, learn and communicate.', edited by [[Frode Alexander Hegland]] which I've just discovered invented augmented pieces of software to deal with text: http://augmentedtext.info 
    - From the foreword: #quote "Digital communication has different characteristics than analog communication environments....Some are beginning to be seen, including the potential of **digital links and connections** (emphasis mine). Others are still beyond our imagination"
    - It seemed like a great addition to this group of text fanatics here.  
        - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] text **and** dance fanatic here üòâ
