    - The Dreyfus model, described by brothers [[Stuart Dreyfus]] and [[Hubert Dreyfus]], is a model based on observations of chess players, Air Force pilots, army commanders and tank drivers. The Dreyfus brothers believed learning was experiential (learning through experience) as well as situation-based, 
and that a student had to pass through five very distinct stages in 
learning, from novice to expert.
