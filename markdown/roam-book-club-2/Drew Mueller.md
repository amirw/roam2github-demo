    - Summarize the highlights into my own words
    - Use search to pull up key concepts or words that I am working with while writing a paper in the #sidebar and pull in references and add unlinked references to connect themes across papers.
    - Outline and summarize key concepts across papers into a potential outline for a paper or literature review
    - Fill in with key insights and new ideas that are the new paper's contribution to the [[boundaries of knowledge]]

        - writing is thinking
            - " Everybody writes. Especially in academia. Students write and professors write. And nonfiction writers, who are the third group of people this book is aiming to help, obviously write as well. And writing doesn’t necessarily mean papers, articles or books, but everyday, basic writing. We write when we need to remember something, be it an idea, a quote or the outcome of a study. We write when we want to organise our thoughts and when we want to exchange ideas with others. Students write when they take an exam, but the first thing they do to prepare even for an oral examination is to grab pen and paper. We write down not only those things we fear we won’t remember otherwise, but also the very things we try to memorise. Every intellectual endeavour starts with a note. [*](((hG7TRPF5I)))"
