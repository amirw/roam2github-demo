- "#Question [[Jason Kleinberg ðŸŽ»]] Could a literature note be a part of the Zettlekasten? You may not have any original thinking on a particular idea but want it to be part of your thinking and knowledge management system. "
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] It can have a place to live, yes, but the suggestion would be to have it live in a place that is firewalled from the main conversation, or put in other words--placed into safe storage as `Project Notes`
        - Think of `Project Notes` as building blocks, that have not been fully fleshed out, but ideas and concepts that you'd want to let sit, so the thoughts can ruminate
    - Here's an example of a literature note I want to include:
    - #[[Literature Notes]] "Habit change is more difficult in times of stress."
        - #Reply-from[[Mike Kramer]] I very much wish to avoid hair-splitting, scholastic discussions of terminology. Having said that, I now wish to explain the terminological distinctions that I make, based on my best understanding of how to implement an Ahrens-like Zettelkasten in Roam.
            - I always make a permanent note a page.  I do this because my goal is to create a denser network of meaningful links and Roam is tuned for links among pages, not blocks.
                - I never make a literature note a page. I always make it as block in the page named by the book's title.
                    - #Reply [[Kate Foy ðŸŒ±]] Do you then tag the block as such, Mike?
            - It wouldn't matter to me if you were to promote your literature note to a permanent note or copy it to make a new note. 
            - It is probably the case that most permanent notes will be the ideas of others, since the idea is that most good ideas are new combinations of pre-existing elemental ideas.
            - If I thought I wanted to remember what the [[Tunnel Effect]] was (someone else has already created this tag), I would create a tag and would probably write the note something like this: "habit change is more difficult in times of stress because of the [[Tunnel Effect]]."
        - It is also difficult to change behaviour in times of stress. The more pressure we feel, the more we tend to stick to our old routinesâ€“even when these routines caused the problems and the stress in the first place. This is known as the tunnel effect (Mullainathan and Shafir 2013). But Mullainathan and Shafir, who examined this phenomenon thoroughly, also found a way out of it: Change is possible when the solution appears to be simple. [*](((SF8pUW-gw)))
        - This lit note says everything I want it to say. It doesn't offer any new thinking, but I know it will inform other ideas I'm working with in the Zettlekasten.
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] YES! And what gradually happens, or to know if your Zettelkasten is truly talking to you is, when each phase begins informing you of the crystallized Zettels that you have already written.
                - The thinking about your thinking is one of the reasons why [[Niklas Luhmann]] had these three distinct phases.
                - It's allowing the thoughts to coalesce and through the ruminating--to be able to add to the discussion through unique insights

- "#Reply [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] Why can't it be an actual `Collective Zettelkasten`? Check out the #Zettels â†’ page where a conversation is already starting~ ðŸ˜³"
    - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] thanks for pointing out conversations are already alive!  Itâ€™s interesting to see the debate you have going on with [[Carolina Brum]] :)
    - Just added a zettel to invite the clan to work towards crafting our declaration around what `Collective Zettlekasten` is
        - #Reply [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] I love it! But where can I see the process of how you abstracted that from the bottom-up? I don't see references to the source material when I click on the `[[Page]]`
            - In other words, the source of evidence where in which this idea was extracted from
                - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] glad weâ€™re in tune here. I, too, had the same concern too and I validated I was able to drill down into the Zettel, follow its evolution through two zettels, see `Literature Notes` and then made sure the root zettel has `Fleeting Notes` in the format our club decided on. Iâ€™d insert a video, canâ€™t commit to do this until after the 10th and trust youâ€™ll figure it out and reveal the power of Roam! :)
            - And one last note would be to examine if the "thumbnail" representation of `Collective Zettelkasten` is more akin to the traditional way of organizing in folders, and if it directly represents the larger, high-resolution `[[Permanent Note]]` that is written to the right
                - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] not sure what you mean here.  Youâ€™ll have to be more specific as to what actual words were chosen. I checked the `Zettels` page to see if you had responded more rigorously and what would be useful is to perhaps respond with a Zettel so we can pursue discourse around the distinctions between our two perspectives (and spawn new Zettels - yeay! :)
            - Why don't you jump on a [Coaching Session](https://calendly.com/beauhaan/zettelkasten) this week?
                - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] i only set aside time for book club until 11/29 and have applications due on 12/9. If I run into a wall, Iâ€™ll let you know - at this point, I need to just cross the finish line and write a 1500 word statement of purpose.  thank you for inviting me again - I got your request to follow up from our meetup on Sunday and if itâ€™s okay with you, please email me (or start a thread here) and weâ€™ll do our best to get you what you need before the 10th.
    - <- this is a **ton** of context for how I came to conclude & add a Zettel ðŸ˜…
        - We have a chicken and egg challenge I think.  The goal of book club is to read and Zettel Sonkeâ€™s book together and explore multiplayer roam.
        - We let all participants define their own [[Goals for Book Club]]
            - [[Matt McKinlay]] is correct in that it would take a very concerted effort to stop and craft a group goal together (which sounds quite noble and Iâ€™m all up for it!).  Only then will we will have a context for directed dialogue/discourse to fulfill on a collective purpose the group agrees on.
        - Weâ€™ve kept it simple by allowing everyone to focus on getting their own slipboxes bootstrapped in Roam.
        - It is admirable to have some form of `Collective Zettlekasten` going (i want this too!) and want to be sure it doesnâ€™t detract from everyoneâ€™s primary goal to get a complete slipbox put together (as defined by processing all their literature notes) and more importantly, fulfill on any primary goals they may have had (using my slipbox to facilitate crafting my statement of purpose is mine)
        - Iâ€™m just going to put it out there (and happy to hear other ideas): I do think one of the more impactful **applications** of a `Collective Zettlekasten` revolves around in the domain of wellbeing. I am in the process of designing my argument in the statement of purpose I am writing. I spent time pulling context of my research from my personal graph into the header of [[Chinarut/Zettels]] to support this effort.
            - itâ€™s a whole other conversation in regards to getting to a place where participants of book club can block reference items in our personal graphs & vice versa - [[Bardia Pourvakil]] said it is coming and looking forward to it :)
- #Chat [[Beau Haan ðŸ“Œ]] The more I walk through this process with others, the less I really know. The insights from going through this journey with others--is truly amazing~
