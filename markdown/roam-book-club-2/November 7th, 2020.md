- #Chat [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] process observation re: #[[Multiplayer Roam]] that might be helpful for tomorrow: 
    - when lots of people are active simultaneously, it can be tough to figure out where to type, exactly, onto any common page where activity is happening
    - notice, though - you can have your own personal page open in the side window, and use that as your scratchpad, to type into
    - then you just "drag" what you type into the main window
    - #Reply-from [[Matt McKinlay]] Yep good point Matt. Can be disorientating. I think the traffic might cause syncing issues during live session with so many people all trying to sync at once, so I might ask people to write in their own graph and sync across here later.

- #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"It's the end of November. What's different to today about your reading and writing?"
    1. [[Beau Haan üìå]] #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[To infuse the process of reading and writing with the powerful force of love, can transcend one to places that provides clarity beyond what's known]]
        - I close my eyes and I can see it, I can taste it, I can feel it in every fiber of my body. It's not the destination, but the journey, resounds in between the drums of my ears. 
            - I am whole, of course, since I know that anything less than from a place of wholeness, lacks the fullness of life it takes to withstand the struggles. To stand strong against the push-back that happens naturally, when engaging in,  and wrestling with the complexities of life. I am hopeful.
        - Today I am whole, yes. And tomorrow, I will be whole, too. I choose to? Is it me that does the choosing? I am awaiting something, maybe it's the answer, or maybe it's just this gnawing feeling that the power that have within me hasn't been fully unleashed yet. 
        - I'm surrounded by sycophants, that admire me, but that's nothing to the most empowering feeling of actually being able to touch someone because of my resiliency. 
        - All of this is beginning to make sense, and when I think about what my reading and writing looks like, I can describe it with one word... love
        - It's not the generic, throw away, but the genuine, whole-hearted thing, that really transcends.
            - But how am I supposed to accept that if I am stagnant in what I think I want, when what I think I want, hasn't given me what I wanted.
            - I'm strong, yes, I am. I am stronger than most, I scream internally. Yet, the guise falls down, when I can still see the disappointment in her face. She's not fulfilled since her seed hasn't been able to succeed, at least according to what her friends think. 
                - Well, fuck them. I don't give a damn about expectations placed upon me by the worst of cultural assessments. 
                - I do this for me, and I know I'm worthy of it.
            - So again, I ask myself. What the fuck does that look like?
        - Maybe all of this is preparation for something much bigger than me. I can hear [[Roam]] calling to me. This fucking tool, man.... I don't fucking know, but I'm in.
        - I can't remember the last time, I've felt this way about something. I know that the acting is crucial, since I've felt the surge of change when I've performed. I know the avatar that being on the screen allows for, and I know that the stories I want told, aren't being told so...
        - There's got to be more. This pattern of thought is lacking, and I know it.
        - All of these barriers are shedding around me. I'm ready.
        - Where I see myself is clear, and I'm happy.
    2. [[Jason Caro]] I find myself reading more slowly and in smaller chunks than before. Some days my reading windows are only 15 minutes at a time, as I am currently traveling for work. I am sure this would disappoint [[Cal Newport]] for not being long enough for [[Deep Work]]. But actually, I am surprised by how productive these short 15 min sessions have become. It is rare that I don't come away with at least 1 or 2 promising [[Fleeting Notes]] or [[Literature notes]]. For the rest of November, I would like to experiment with taking fleeting notes into Roam directly, rather than using an intermediate.
    3. [[Joshua Gerald Butler]] By the end of November I hope to have implemented the process of writing a paper that Sonke lays out in the book, where I have done all my reading and my note taking, and then I pull my ideas naturally out of these notes to form my paper; much more like nurturing a garden than creating a building. I hope that my reading becomes more intentional, and that I spend the time to be taking notes; and then also remember to reflect on them and turn them into permanent notes soon after. 
    4. [[Dan Allosso]] By the end of November I hope to have a daily routine where I regularly add reading notes, review my graph for link opportunities, and reflect on permanent notes. I have already been able to turn a collection of linked notes into a short essay (podcast script), but I‚Äôd like to be surprised by unlinked references. Looking forward to that first ‚Äúcritical mass‚Äù moment.
    5. [[Jason Griffing]] I am not letting the notes and highlights I'm taking in my book pile up until I'm done with the book. I'm sitting down for at least 15 minutes after my kids go to bed every night to do quick note-taking^^^^ in Roam. I hope this will help me develop a more cohesive and comprehensive understanding of the whole work. 
    6. [[andygoodman]] I've a clear separation between fleeting notes, permanent notes and project notes. I'll have honed my practice of distilling permanent notes from my fleeting notes. In doing so, I'll have built a set of permanent notes that begin to cluster and through positive feedback will increase the coherence and focus of my work. In turn, this will improve the efficiency and effectiveness of my communication up, down and outside the organisations I work with.
    7. [[Alex Shchedrin]] I developed a better habit for making time for my thinking and writing. This time is spent reviewing the notes taken between the sessions and having conversations with my past and future self via my personal graph. 
I find more joy in reading because it lets me explore my curiosity, learn more, and share this with others in writing, audio or video. 
I hope this change will also make me more consistent in producing valuable insights and content related to the industry of travel, transportation and hospitality technology.

- #Chat [[Dan Allosso]] How many people do [[Interstitial Journaling]]? Seems like Ahrens is talking about that in Chapter 9, around p. 70 and following. I've started thinking about trying it, to generate more insights into how I'm feeling about the work as well as record ideas I have as I'm working. 
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] yes, great resonance there

- #Chat [[Mike Kramer]] one hunch on how to connect book club 1 with book club 2:
    - there are two fundamental kinds of connections in the space of a [[Zettelkasten]]
        - weak connections: every note in the [[Zettelkasten]] is weakly connected with every other note in the same [[Zettelkasten]] by virtue of the fact that the [[Zettelkasten]] has weakly brought them together
        - strong connections: when one note is explicitly linked with another note, those notes are strongly brought together
    - when an idea that was generated to fulfill one function in one text is reproduced to fulfill a different function in a different text, we can say that the idea has been exapted
    - a [[Zettelkasten]] is an exaptation-generating machine
        - a [[Zettelkasten]] weakly connects ideas that were previously unconnected
            - this is one way to generate exaptations
                - this is analogous to the biosphere in Stuart Kaufman's theory of the [[adjacent possible]]
                    - lots of different entities exist in a given biosphere / [[Zettelkasten]], but we can play God by selecting what to put in the [[Zettelkasten]]
        - a [[Zettelkasten]] fosters the generation of strong connections among ideas that were previously only weakly connected
            - this is another way to generate exaptations
                - this is analogous to combining entities to create higher-order entities in Kaufman's biosphere
                    - lots of combinations of notes are possible in our [[Zettelkasten]] but we use artificial selection (analogous to what Darwin defined) to allow to come into being only those combinations that resonate with us the most
    - #Reply [[Jason Griffing]] __"...an exaptation-generating machine."__ ‚ù§
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] yeah I love this Mike! The weak/strong connection distinction hits the nail on the head for me, too.
    - #Reply-from [[Jason Caro]] this is a great connection and I completely agree with the way it is framed here for applicability to [[Zettelkasten]].  In support of the Slipbox as __"an exaptation-generating machine"__, the element of randomness/chance might also be helpful.
        - The exaptation-generating ability of a [[Zettelkasten]] grows as it increases its ability for chance encounters between notes.
            - chance improves the likelihood of repurposing existing ideas in non-obvious ways 
                - the shift of the feather as a feature of thermal regulation to a feature of flying benefited from chance
        - How does a [[Zettelkasten]] increase its ability for chance encounters between notes?

- [[Jason Griffing]] **Dealing sternly with your memory**:
    - __"You should deal sternly and despotically with your memory, so that it does not unlearn obedience; if, for example, you cannot call something to mind, a line of poetry or a word perhaps, you should not go and look it up in a book, but periodically plague your memory with it for weeks on end until your memory has done its duty. For the longer you have had to rack your brains for something the more firmly will it stay once you have got it."__

- #Chat [[Siva Arunagiri]] a quick question. #[[Fleeting Notes]] is not the same as #highlighting stuff right? It is writing down your understanding from what you are reading but at the same time how do you process your #Highlights. 
    - #Reply-from [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]] Siva, in my opinion, there is a distinction. I tend to think of highlighting as "layer zero" - the initial act of simply choosing what we are responding to.
        - #Reply-from [[Siva Arunagiri]] ‚Äúlayer zero‚Äù makes sense. 
    - To me, #[[Fleeting Notes]] are the next layer - the layer of my very first, raw, initial response. 
    - It's what I think or feel, in direct response to what I read, and it happens before I try to formulate it in my own words
    - For me, the reformulation into my own words is a next level of processing, "layer two"
    - And then the linking or recombining of reformulations is "layer three", and above.
    - #[[Reply-from]] [[andygoodman]] These 'layers' and the blurring between them have been the primary cause of uncertainty for me. I've concluded that it depends, which is not helpful since further classification is required. Since it is stated that sometimes it's fine to go straight to literature note, this doesn't cause concern.
    The guiding principle when taking fleeting notes is for them not to become a distraction from reading. As I've worked to establish where the boundary lies between 'layers' I've found it depends on the complexity of the idea in the text behind the highlight.
    When the idea is simple I dictate a note straight into readwise, which does not create distraction. When the idea is complex I doodle to make sense of the idea, which I feel is essential. I use Notes app on my ipad, which I have in a window next to Kindle app.
    When dictating my understanding to create a note for highlighted text immediately using dictation, the boundary between a fleeting note and literature note is defined by whether I make corrections to the meaning of the note. Dictation is often imperfect so when trying to maintain flow, I'll allow myself to correct erroneous words but not refine the meaning. It is tempting to clarify the meaning of the dictated note, but this would be a distraction and consequently flow would be lost. 
    I suspect that the ease with which one can generate notes using readwise and dictation might cause me problems later, by creating too many notes. I am probably not being selective enough. Also worth considering is the time between making a fleeting note and converting  it to a literature note, I think.
        - #Reply-from [[Siva Arunagiri]] doodling makes sense. And yes the layers are at times blurred into one but I guess we can fine tune and tailor make [[S√∂nke Ahrens]]‚Äô steps to suit our needs. 
- [[Jason Kleinberg üéª]]
    - This method of reading and writing applies to other media besides words. It's a practice of consuming media in a more intentional way. 
    - I'm trying to break the habit of passively listening to podcasts while doing yoga or some other activity. If it's something that affects my interests and learning, then I want to consume it with full mind and heart. And so a good podcast calls for note-taking, making connections, literature and permanent notes. 
    - Even a good movie or work of fiction calls for this. What have I learned from this film, story, podcast, or article?
    - This raises questions about [[Fleeting Notes]]. 
        - Are these breadcrumbs which will help us return to the idea for further development? 
        - How deep do I want to go with a fleeting note? What will be enough information? 
        - How much do I want to return to the source later on, how much do i just want to capture in the moment? 
        - At the same time, how can I take fleeting notes to remain in a state of reading flow?
            - (oops Jason my apologies, think the multiplayer interface is a little buggy
            - I accidentally interrupted your flow - so sorry. - [[Matt Brockwell/MJB]]
            - let's let the team know that the "can't edit into other people's blocks" seems to be a little buggy. )
- #Chat [[Dan Allosso]] I don't disagree with Ahrens' argument that students are not being well served when they're told to "squeeze a nonlinear process like writing into linear order". But on the other hand, I feel like this is becoming a bit of a straw-man. Yes, it's unsurprising that students feel stressed when asked to write on something they haven't had an opportunity to study and read and take notes on for months or years. But let's be realistic: in any given semester, they're going to be confronted with new topics and information that they've probably never considered before (at least, hopefully!), and then will be asked to respond to this new information in writing. This process, therefore, is something students should learn as early as possible in their careers and then practice from day one in a class. I need to design my courses to make this happen.
    - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] This also pre-supposes that the current state of education is the most effective way of teaching, when the advent of [[YouTube]], podcasts, lectures on line, ebooks, asynchronous learning, etc, has begun lifting the veil of what "could" be possible with the learning systems
        - But again, I'm probably jaded, because I personally have forgone higher education, sowing my wild oats, and then coming back to this sphere with an open-mindedness to possibilities, since I'm not restrained by indoctrination
        - What if we asked better questions? What if the stability of the current educational systems are undergoing a transformation and even with Zoom meetings happening with elementary students, and more professors utilizing other mediums to get their lessons across, what are the other exciting ways to adopt a fresh set of eyes to solve the problems?
        - Maybe the power is actually in your hands? Maybe the change is the small ripples that happen in the practice of teaching this way of note-taking? Maybe the needle has already shifted and we are just catching up to it?
            - Watching you type is blowing my mind, right now! ü§Ø
        - #Reply-from [[Dan Allosso]] Good points, Beau. I made a [video](https://youtu.be/YU5BePihGB8) about hybrid flexible (HyFlex) courses about a month ago, and since then my administration has asked me to pilot a "Community of Practice" at my University to try the format out. It's designed to create equivalency between in-person, synchronous remote (Zoom), and online delivery and assessment. So yeah, it's better to be the disruptor than the disrupted.
            - #Reply [[Beau Haan üìå]] "Create situations where students __want__ to participate" 
                - Jeez, that's resonating with me... I see it my friend, it's just around the bend!
                - And as I'm watching the video, I'm thinking of retention too, since some of us, myself included, learn--or rather engage with the learning process at hours different from most. 
                    - And if I am **willing** to participate, and given the option of allowing those moments to happen organically, then the learning fits into my own personal proclivities, which might have kept me in so-called school, instead of opting for the more uncertain real-world of hard-knocks
                - #Reply [[Dan Allosso]] Yeah, with all the options for learning I think it's time for higher ed to realize that its days as gatekeeper are probably coming to an end. If all we have is the "stick" of being able to withhold degrees and no "carrot" of exciting, effective education, then we're done. I went to the Open Ed Global conference last November in Milan, and met some people who were working on a blockchain-based credential management system. Also met Martin Dougiamas, the guy who invented Moodle. He has some cool ideas about new education opportunities, too.
