            - love the guest book! reminds me of the good ole days of home pages from 1995 - time to insert the visitor count ;)
            - I’m exploring possibilities w an in-graph #support model.  I’ve added `IssueType:` attributes to a few of your requests/reports
            - I added a reference to a chat to clarify the vision for what a community Zettlekasten looks like and in particular, how it works across books/literary references (as this is how a real one would work!)
        - [[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]] [[November 21st, 2020]]
            - Hey, I really appreciate how clearly you explained your Zettelkasten process. 
            - #Question  Are your literature notes inline as well? If so, does it look something like this:
                - {Source text block}
                    - #[[Literature notes]] {Summary of the text in your own words.}
            - Also where would you first write your permanent notes?  Would they be nested under the literature notes or would they live on a separate permanent notes page?

        - [[Mike Kramer]][[December 7th, 2020]]
            - Here is the Toulmin Argument Method mentioned in the Live Session by [[Matt McKinlay]]
                - https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/general_writing/academic_writing/historical_perspectives_on_argumentation/toulmin_argument.html
            - Off the top of my head, relationships among permanent notes would also include:
                - ordering:
                    - temporal
                    - spatial 
                    - causal
                    - or any  other measurable property: temperature, radioactivity, radicalism, etc.
                - generalization vs instantiation
            - From my current perspective, I do not see much benefit in tagging the relationships among permanent notes according to whether they are causal, evidential, logical, etc. 
                - I am having trouble imagining why I would ever want to pull up all my causal argument structures.
                - Please note, that I __do__  endorse using tags to describe the __content__ of a note, e.g., "Surrealism," "psychology," "Russia," "exploitation," or "mammal." 
                - Additiionally, I do endorse explicitly stating whether the relationship among permanent notes is causal, explanatory, etc. I am merely saying that I, as yet, do not see the value in using tags for "causal," "explantory," etc.
                - And, for a given area, I might want to create a tag like "inconsistencies in Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey"
                - Lastly, the fractal nature of our minds and our Zettelkastens means that what are reasons in one context, can be conclusions in a different context.
            - What __would__ be of great interest to me would be tags that could distinguish among permanent notes that include:
                1. notes that are part of an aggregated note, but do not themselves contain other notes, i.e., most of the Zettels currently in this database
                2. a mere group of related notes, in no particular order, the relationship of which is not stated
                3. a group of notes that are listed in a meaningfull--but unstated--order
                4. a group of notes that are listed in a meaningful order, which is explicitly stated (e.g., specific to general, time of occurrence, distance from origin, size, mass, temperature, etc.)
                5. a group of notes that have complex, explicitly stated relationships among each other (e.g., reasons, causes, etc.).
            - Once I had the permanent notes above tagged according to their status, I could establish a workflow, looking at the notes occasionally to see if I could "consolidate" them by:
                - connecting them to other notes, or
                - making the relationships among their component notes more specific (roughly, moving from type 1 to type 5 in the list, above)
            - Example:
                - I could have a note like, "The best way to organize a messy room is by category."
                    - at first, this note would be a singleton. It would only have tags, but it would not contain other notes. It would not have a type, according to the taxonomy above.
                    - Over time, I would put in the body of this note explicitly stated reasons to support the claim expressed in the note's title. This would now be a type 5 note.
                - I could have another note like, "The best way to organize a messy room is by location."
                    - In the body of this note, there would be explicitly stated reasons to support the claim expressed in the note's title. This would be a type 5 note.
                - And, perhaps, at some later date, I might come to some higher-level understanding like, "The best way to organize a messy room is by creating a project in Roam."
                    - In the body of this note, I might present explicitly stated arguments about why the two other notes, listed above, were inadequate. This, too, would be a type 5 note.

                - [[@Mike Kramer]] — Thanks for this! I just went down the rabbit hole on it. I like the structure and simplicity of the [[Toulmin Argument Method]] as a basis for mapping the vocabulary.

I'm interested in exploring the vocabulary:

- stating the [[rebuttal]] to the [[claim]]

    1. [[consume]] & [[engage]]: (read, watch, listen, converse, reflect)
    2. As content resonates with me, I save them as [[reference notes]] (capturing [[context]] — [[bibliographical notes]], [[highlights]], and [[quotes]]) #capture
    3. As my wanderings inspire thoughts and ideas, I save those ideas as [[fleeting notes]].
        - These are statements written inline with my notes. [[fleeting notes]] are **the first tier of notes worth documenting** in my [[interpretation]].
        - I keep the `originals` of these notes in a designated place. I keep a copy of the reference [[inline]] to preserve the context of where the note originated. 
            - Example:: "#[[Fleeting Notes]] The power of a [collaborative graph database]([[Multiplayer Roam]]) improves with the degree of alignment with key [[conventions]]. Data needs to be compiled in order to [compound]([[compounding]])."
        - [[supporting information]] is nested underneath the original block. As a block reference if necessary to preserve context of the related idea.
        - [[tags]] may be added inline at the end of the note or nested underneath to aid in [[connection]] and [[resurfacing]].
        - When adding new [[fleeting notes]] to my [[zettelkasten]], I locate them in close proximity to related notes and ideas. If they feel relevant to several different areas of the zettelkasten, I will create a [[reference]] to nest it underneath the other related note(s).
    4. For content that I consider worth summarizing (the author makes great points that I would love to reference later in my own writing/ideas) — I form `#Literature Notes` #[[literature notes]]
        - These are core concept summaries. They are **the author's ideas** phrased **in my own words**. They should be [[concise]] and [[atomic]] in nature. **Only one idea or concept per literature note**.
    5. As both [[fleeting notes]] and [[literature notes]] accumulate, [[patterns]] emerge and my [[opinions]] embolden. When it feels like I can form a [permanent note]([[permanent notes]]) on the subject, I create one.
    6. As [[project ideas]] arise through different stages of the workflow, I add them to a section of my [[zettelkasten]] called `[[Project Ideas]]`.
        - Over time, I link ideas that may be related to the project by referencing them as a [[nested block]].
        - Once a clear outline has formed, or enough [[content]] exists to easily begin [[writing]], **I complete the project and the cycle continues**. 🎉🥂

        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[inline code-blocks]] can be used as an alternative formatting option.
        - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[inline code-blocks]] can be used to "deactivate" a tag, preventing it from appearing in queries or references.
            - This is. helpful when demonstrating the **use of a tag** when you don't want to muddy up the references.

            - The [[evergreen notes]] [[metaphor]] works better here. 
                - [[seedlings]] are the base-ideas. The "seeds" of more mature thought. These accumulate and grow connections until they can mature into [[evergreen notes]].

    - Discussion on [[zettel questions]]
        - "#Question [[Jason Kleinberg 🎻]] How do YOU create notes for questions? Are they [[fleeting notes]]? How would you deal with refining or follow-up questions?"
            - "It seems to me that a persistent idea might be better framed as a question. At some point it might start to look like an assertion. And then at some point, would all related questions be nested under the assertion?"
            - "Yes ... for me questions often feel so "important" that I want to make them their own category. I've experimented with calling them "Zettelquestions". I think they are a different form of "organizer" entirely - not statements about what we DO know or what we DO feel comfortable asserting, but rather, pointers of our active curiosity, illuminating the things we do not yet know. "
                - "In that sense, I think they are closer to what I am calling "Permanent Notes" in the nomenclature - which is to say, I grant them provisional permanence within the evolving slip-box - but I like to think of them as their own category."
    - On assertions
        - "Having a galaxy brain moment here 🤯"
    - On whether tags should be used:
        - "the consensus seems to be that tags should be used minimally and outline notes, or structure notes, or indexes, or notes that are lists of other notes, are the better way to go."
    - [[Beau Haan 📌]]'s [[zettelkasten]] journey
        - "[[Beau Haan 📌]] I signed up for [[Roam]]'s #Believer plan on [[July 8th, 2020]] and began reading [[Sönke Ahrens]] book around that same time too."

    - #quote **collection:**
        - "(Getting the tools ready shouldn’t have taken more than 5-10 minutes. But having the right tools is only one part of the equation. It is easy to get fooled by their simplicity. Many “tried them out” without really understanding how to work with them and were expectedly disappointed with the results. Tools are only as good as your ability to work with them. Everybody knows how to handle a flute (you blow into one end and press your fingers on the holes according to the notes you are playing), but nobody would try it out once and then judge the instrument on what they hear.)"
    - Book Club Thoughts:: #[[November 1st, 2020]] 
        - "Work" vs [[Company]]
        - Noticed the [[attributes]] are fractioning in to name and "- name" 
        - [[Book Club Guidelines]] #[[Questions (META)]]
            - Naming conventions?
            - Can we make pages?
                - I think yes.
            - Is there a directory of pages and their purpose?
                - As I make pages that can be used by others, I'll include a description on the page itself
            - Rather than different "questions page" 
        - Conventions
            - Write in your own page or daily notes
            - Use nesting
        - Tags to use
            - `#Ideas`, `#[[Questions (META)]]`, `#Announcement`
            - `#[[Book Club Thoughts]]`
            - `#Issues`, `#[[bug-report]]`, `#Experiment`, `#Suggestions`

    - #[[Questions (META)]] #[[Book Club Questions]] #Suggestions
        - Can we get [[Roam42]]??
    - meta:: 
        - "#[[Fleeting Notes]][[hidden tags]] would be hugely beneficial to the [[UX]] in a shared Roam database. #Suggestions #[[enhancement request]] #Highlight"
            - This is because of the diversity of tags used by users, it is often beneficial to include multiple tag variants on a block in order to increase the probability of [[resurfacing]] and subsequent [[serendipity]] of [[connections]].
                - #example
                    - "conventions:: #meta #collaboration #[[large scale collaboration]] #[[multiplayer]] #[[Multiplayer Roam]] #[[[[multiplayer]] [[Roam]]]]"
                        - With this example, I'd like to be able to easily `hide` all tags from view, while still having them as active.
                            - I wouldn't want to `filter out` the tags, because I want to see the other content.
                            - I would only want to `hide` the # tags, and note the [[]] page links 
                                - This is because of [[readability]]. [[]] are used for [[inline tagging]]. While # tags are appended for the purposes of [[metadata]]
                                    - This may be [[opinionated design]], but I think this would be worthwhile. 
                                        - Afterall, if a user uses tags in another way, this feature wouldn't `harm` their workflow, they simply would not benefit as greatly from it. — and could always choose to adapt to this style.

            - How could you establish [[conventions]] to enable the ability to "[[subscribe]] to [[updates]]"?
                - Collaborative databases are constantly evolving. I would love to be able to subscribe to updates related to a specific aspect of the graph.
                - The first method that comes to mind is a series of individual [[tag]]-[[trackers]]. 
                    - Though, this could get noisy without [[hidden tags]] [*](((N6X01wg75)))
            - How could you "clear" a [[notification]]?
            - How can you separate mentions, author stamps, calls for attention, etc. all would use the `[[your name]]` tag.
            - How could a `#not-populated` tag be used strategically?
                -  for filtering out empty attributes

                    - "Protect the [[signal]], reduce the [[noise]]. #Highlight"
                    - This could also be used with an [[invisible tag]] to improve the UI (so you don't see `#not-populated`)
                        - Note, an [[invisible tag]] is different than a [hidden tag]([[hidden tags]]) as an invisible tag is permanently invisible via CSS, a hidden tag is an enhancement request involving a [[toggle]]

                    - "If you do that, your typing will not disturb other people's view, nor can they type into the block that you are writing into. "
                - "Note that one challenge is when more than one person are typing into a conversation at the same time - it can be hard to keep everything sequenced in temporal order while more than one are typing, but taking a moment to move blocks back into temporal order if they fall "out of order" -"

                                    - Not writing/creating but implementing
                                - Interest in the ideas of the book
                                    - Use book as a starting place
                                    - To criticize / change content
                                    - For this goal — take strict [[zettelkasten]] notes!
                                    - The best way to put something into practice is not necessarily the same as developing ideas about it, or stemming from it.
                                - Individual vs collective [[zettelkasten]]
                                    - There are differences
                                    - "Glad I kept it abstract"
                                        - Easier to adjust it to application with Roam
                                        - Allow muyself to write much longer notes
                                        - Able to have the granularity at the block level
                                    - Main features of zettle

                                            - Dialogue between the notes
                                            - [[example]] "But in contradiction to" "actually" XYZ shows "this"
                                        - "My go to disctinction"
                                            - If I tag something as a hastag (one word)
                                                - Link to a page, more like a [[index]] entry
                                            - Different than more descriptive titles (more than one word)

                                                - Entry points or clusters

            - [[Goals of Book Club]] #writing #[[writing session]] #goals #Goal
                - I am deeply fascinated by this experiment
                - I am interested in the structure of engaging with content as an aynchronous community.
                - I think the ideas from the book can actual serve as basis to evolve towards [[conventions]] to use within the [[Roam Book Club]] overall.
                - [[Question]]
                    - What [[conventions]] are helpful to corale and constrain group thinking towards intentional outputs?
                    - How is information best captures, clarified, organized, and reviewed in order to accomplish shared goals.
                - I think the ideas around [[purpose]] and [[goals]] are essential to success of these sorts of communities. 
                    - When there is a shared sense of direction... you can build structures ([[conventions]]) that bias towards the achievement of those goals.
                - [[progressive summarization]] of community goals would be interesting here. 
                    - Taking [[fleeting notes]] and evolving them towards more refined and well-thought out ideas around goals.
                    - Like this, is a flow-based [[writing session]], that has good, but also half-baked or sloppy ideas.
                    - What is the best way to revisit these fleeting notes (generated by the community as a whole) to begin to have them represented in increasingly refined summaries... while maintaining [[reference]] and [[connection]] to their source #context #Question
                - Some non-goals related thoughts here "Further reflections "
            - Further reflections 
                - Observing the [[Roam Research]] usage behaviours of hundreds of people will be good creative inspiration for my own writing and roaming [[conventions]]
                    - How other people do things, will influence my best practices and [[conventions]].
                - Writing in a public roam database makes you think more explicitly about the nature of the content. Less assumptions. You need to make a road map of sorts. 
                    - Which is likely good even within your own DB!
                    - Writing "in the presence of" a collective, makes you consider all of their viewpoints.
                        - Makes you write in a way that *anyone* could follow along.
                        - Makes you define things more clearly.
                        - Well... maybe not in the [[fleeting notes]] sections.... this is going to be straight [[chaos]].
                - A shared [[writing]] environment as an accelerator for cycles of [[order]] and [[chaos]] ([[expansion]] and [[contraction]]) ([[divergence]] and [[convergence]])
                    - With this many writers, pages multiple faster.
                    - It's like running with hundreds of your own clones going paralell.
                    - You get to see population of the content happen at a pace that an individual couldnt maintain.
                    - How could [[Roam Book Club]] be applied to other issues and topics? Shared problems? #Question #[[Goals of Book Club]]
                        - How could this influence organizations? governments? 
                        - This could provide the ability to collaborate with people on a deeper level?
                        - Perhaps, collectively, we could create a [[template]] of [[conventions]] that could be used by any group, working on any problem or pursuit.
                            - A guidebook to collaborative communities.
                            - Start to build the foundations of ideas on how to manage ideas on a larger scale.
                            - Steps to consider and define
                                - What are the collective goals?
                                - What are the problems/challenges?
                                - An growing/evolving index of each
                                - A list of hypotheses associated with each problem/challenge.

                            - Keep ideas growing and moving.
                    - [[conventions]] 
                        - [[thoughts]] as a genre of content

                                - [[thoughts]] is a better catch-all. Which can then be refined further.
                                    - thoughts on what?? (any page name)
                                    - What type of thought?? (ideas, questions, commentary, etc)
                                    - Then you can filter intelligently.
                                        - Thoughts + Book Club + Person
                                            - Refine to "ideas"

                - `#Ideas`
                - `#Highlights`
            - I use lowercase page names `e.g. [[permanent notes]]`

                    - With brief notes on the content (what stood out and why)
                - Ideas inspired by the content/context of the bibliographic component [*](((nm4sR_FVj)))
                    - Formation of [[permanent notes]]
            - Goal: Capture the context & source of anything resonant
                - Source
                - The passage or highlight
                - Brief notes or tags on why it was resonant
                - Tags to connect to other relevant contexts where this may be applicable
            - Tips
                - Should be reviewed as soon as possible to be able to recall the thought that was inspired by the passage. Translated into [[permanent notes]]
            - #Ideas
                - Set up "[[context chutes]]" #Highlights #workflow #process

                                - Kinda cumbersome and distracting I find.
                                - Maybe read then come back for the highlights?
                                    - Don't like this because you'd forget the insight
                            - Manually write notes on a book in [[Drafts (app)]] or in a [[notebook]], capturing necessary context and details

                    - These clippings serve as the tinder for the formation of [[permanent notes]]
                    - #Chat [[Brandon Toner]]
                        - What other "[[context chutes]]" do people use to preserve source and context while capturing brief notes
            - Process
                1. Read, and explore your curiosities. 
                2. Capture resonant passages using the [[context chutes]]
                3. Regularly review the unprocessed contents of the [[Slipbox]], to 
                4. Translate the clips formed from the [[context chutes]] into full thoughts, ideas, and ultimately [[permanent notes]]
                5. linking the [[permanent notes]] to other related ideas
                6. [[using]], [[publishing]], [[sharing]], and [[disseminating]] the [[permanent notes]] — Put them to work! 
                    - Or, what is the [[purpose]] for creating [[permanent notes]]?
                    - Uses
                        - assemble a body of ideas, which can be used to assemble larger creative works
                            - multiple permanent notes becomes an article
                            - multiple articles becomes a book
            - Process (said another way)
                - Read, explore
                - Gather resonant passages, preserving context
                - Review the clippings and assemble ideas #[[permanent notes]]
                - Link the new [[permanent notes]] with other related notes
                - Assemble cumulative creative works using the rich and growing collection of [[permanent notes]].
            - #Questions
                - Where should permanent notes live in Roam once they are created? #Chat [[Brandon Toner]]
                    - In context where they were first created?
                        - Tag with #[[permanent notes]] and any relevant contexts to promote resurfacing?
                        - **I think I like this option best. Keep the original within the original context, and block reference a copy in other sections as relevant**
                    - On a [[permanent notes]] page?
                    - On pages associated with respective topics?
                        - This seems like it would lead to the file/folder dilemma
                - As I [[capture]] resonant content from my wanderings, how to I ensure that content is reviewed for creation of [[permanent notes]]? #Chat [[Brandon Toner]]
                    - While capturing add a #Slipbox tag? 
                        - Could set up a text expander such that `,sb` expands to `#slipbox`
                    - Review all [[Readwise]] tags after import, adding a `#processed` tag after the item has been reviewed and processed?
        - #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"Come up with your own definition of [[fleeting notes]]? "
            - Fleeting notes are the unfiltered, un-edited expressions of what resonates as relating to a passage of content (written or audio)
            - They are the grist for the [[permanent notes]] mill.
            - #Questions
                - Can [[fleeting notes]] be thoughts? (no source material to reference)
                - How are [[fleeting notes]] and [[brief notes]] different?
                    - Are brief notes intended to be more "brief" — simply acting to "point to" why a passage was resonant... without trying to explore the idea in a draft format?
                    - Whereas [[fleeting notes]] are closer to [[permanent notes]]?
        - #[[Daily Writing Prompt]]"It's the end of November. What's different to today about your reading and writing?"
            - My reading and writing practice has become more structured and intentional. 
            - I have clear processes for capturing insights while I am reading, using set processes for each different consumption environment #[[context chutes]]
            - I take the time to **process** [[fleeting notes]] into [[Permanent notes]], rather than allowing unprocessed content to build up indefinitely.
            - That being said, I don't believe that all captured material should be processed. I believe there is value to allowing the raw clippings to resurface naturally in the future. 
                - For this reason, it is important to tag potentially relevant resurfacing context **while capturing** resonant information. 
        - Live Session II [[November 8th, 2020]] #[[Live Session 2]]
            - "Reflection on first reading phase of the book "
                - The first part of the book always gets me thinking. I love the exploration of the philosophy of reading, writing, and creating. 
                - [[Sönke Ahrens]] does a great job of highlighting the problem, providing references and sources to back up claims, and proposing potential solutions to the challenges of managing knowledge work.
                - I especially enjoy the structure of the book. It feels as though the ideas arised from the use of a [[zettelkasten]]. Assertions are clearly stated and referenced, followed by discussion of the point. #Highlight
                    - This is the type of writing I would like to generate #goals
                        - Clear statements, well-supported, with a logic flow between ideas to build a strong overall narrative and exploration of a topic.
            - "What ideas resonate with you from the book"
                - The compare & contrast done with [[GTD]] is interesting
                    - I enjoy the commonalities between the approaches.
                        - Both a structured approaches to address a problem
                            - GTD = task and project management
                            - HTTSN = idea generation, creative work, research
                    - Sonke does an excellent job of explaining why GTD doesnt work well for knowledge work. 
                        - The nature of research and creative work is **explorative**. You don't (or shouldn't) begin with the end in mind. 
                            - The ideas emerge as a product of your reading, experiences and subsequent insights and ideas.
                                - As new information arises, the direction of the research may change. 
                                    - This requires a [[bottom up]] approach.

                    - [[fleeting notes]] are the raw exploration of ideas, before they become refined into more polished ideas
                        - They are the [[flow state]] notes — the unfiltered thoughts. 
                            - The free-associations between content, context and ideas. 
                            - They are the leaps your mind makes when presented with an idea.

                - I need work here. 
                - I find taking fleeting notes throughout the day, in non-reading (or less intentional reading) contexts easier than with an actual book.
                    - Here's the challenge I run into with books:
                        1. [[Enviroment]]
                            - I read in bed, or in a chair. Both settings are difficult to take notes in.
                - #goals
                    - Find a way to easily capture fleeting notes while reading physical books.

                    - Topic: impression of book - rehash or new knowledge
                        - Fleeting notes -> emerging structure instead of fixed structure from outset - much better suited for research - this resonated with several participants

cc: [[Ramses Oudt]] (this related to our recent discussions)
                        - "cycles" of brainstorming and reflecting — then compiling and summarizing could then take place to get closer and closer to understanding.
                        - #tensions could be flagged by users or the curator to highlight key areas of tension or differing approach, opinion or perspective. #Highlight
                - I like the idea of using a #Highlight tag throughout your writing to emphasize ideas that feel resonant. Gives you a filter to find your won good ideas — and to give others a filter to use on your page. 
                    - Helps to separate the wheat from the chaff.
                - Adding the `#Chat` tag not just on the main daily notes page, but also weaved into your writing, allows you to tag parts of your writing and reflections that you want commentary on. #Highlight
                    - So others could come to my page, filter by `#Chat` and see areas to contribute their 2 cents.
                    - Also, you could go to the `#Chat` page, and see opportunities to contribute ideas throughout the WHOLE database.
                    - This is really exciting, because people can work independently, with the "garage door open" and invite contribution in targeted ways. #Highlight

        - Reflection on what the [[slip-box]] is and **is not**:
            - "#Chat [[Edvardo Archer]] I have come across several passages of the book that has refined my knowledge of what [[The Slip-box is **NOT**]]. What are the notes you are taking to help you understand what it is and isn't?"
                - "As the slip-box is not a book with just one topic, we don’t need to have an overview of it. On the contrary, we are much better off accepting as early as possible that an overview of the slip-box is as impossible as having an overview of our own thinking while we are thinking. As an extension of our own memory, the slip-box is the medium we think in, not something we think about. The note sequences are the clusters where order emerges from complexity. We extract information from different linear sources and mix it all up and shake it until new patterns emerge. Then, we form these patterns into new linear texts."

        - The [[tone-of-voice]] of a [permanent note]([[permanent notes]]) #reflection
            - Permanent notes or zettles often have an assertive tone of voice. Like they are asserting a fact.
                - I don't typically write in this [[tone-of-voice]] because it often feels **too certain**.
                    - Often, I am hypothesizing, not asserting. This feels awkward. 
                        - Should I maintain an assertive tone, and defend it as best as I can? Or inject some uncertainty into my zettles in order to feel more authentic? #reflection #questions

        - "Define a literature note in your own words."
            - A literature notes is a brief atomic summary of a key concept highlighted in a piece of writing. 
            - It is an "in-your-own-words" summary of an idea.
            - The goal is to create a literature note for any important ideas you discover while reading. 
            - This helps you to internalize and deeply consider the material, and gives you something to build on for your own writing.
            - Having it in your own words is key.
        - "What struggles have you had implementing literature notes?"
            - Lack of dedicated reading/writing time. 
                - I often consume ideas on-the-go. Podcasts and twitter are two of my main sources of inspiration.
                - While I like reading — I don't often engage with it. This may change given the value of this technique.
                - When I do read, it is rarely at a desk or table where I can easily take notes. So taking notes while physically reading is a challenge.
                    - Perhaps a [[Kindle]] is a good solution here. Or a more hospitable desk-environement.
            - Lack of commitment to summarizing steps
                - Always "onto the next"... 
                - I prefer the "fun" of [[fleeting notes]], rarely taking the time to advance my thinking...
                - I can't say I dislike my system though, my ideas do seem to build despite not writing things down in more mature formats...
                - Perhaps this is my own way of weeding out the bad, and allowing the good to stick. 
                - The next time I revisit an idea after some prior thought is usually more refined in thinking naturally...
                - That being said, I could likely benefit from *some* additional commitment to refinement.
                - Tough call. My priority is always to keep it fun and [[non-coercive]].
        - #[[Graph Meditation]] #conventions
            - I like the "Pick from the prompts below" method!

    - #[[[[feedback]]: What's working]]
        - [[custom CSS]] helps to make things clear! 
            - #[[Fleeting Notes]] [[custom CSS]] helps to communicate to the user that they are using a conventional tag.
    - #[[[[feedback]]: What could be better]]
        - More contribution to writing prompts. 
        - A stronger community zettelkasten structure.  
            - #Reply-from [[Chinarut]] agreed! would love to hear how you see our zettels coming together. Perhaps add to this conversation
                - "#Chat [[Chinarut]] I poked into our original book club out of curiosity. How are we leveraging what was developed there and bringing these two books/slipboxes together? It’s absolutely clear to me a tremendous amount of brainthink goes into each of these graphs! I absolutely love [[Lindsey Johnston✨]]’s insight on how #multiplayer pans out & wondering to what degree we are reusing this:"
    - #bug-reports
        - It seems that new pages created from the search bar directly are not being permanently created 
            - IssueType:: #bug
        - The edit icons with the small profile pictures are not showing up correctly — the wrong image is displaying for most users. [[@Matthew McKinlay]]

    - #[[[[feedback]]: [[Suggestions]]]]
        - Create a list of official pages and tags
            - For key terms and global tags
            - Suggested list
                - **Lowercase** for discussing the IDEA OF key terms (reason for lowercase: works well **INLINE**)
                    - `[[literature notes]]`
                    - `[[permanent notes]]`
                    - `[[fleeting notes]]`
                    - `[[zettlekasten]]`
                - Uppercase for **USING** these concepts (i.e. creating literature notes)
                    - These trigger the **custom CSS**
                    - `#[[Fleeting Notes]]`
                    - `#[[Literature Notes]]`
                    - `#[[Permanent Notes]]`
                - Tags
                    - **OFFICIAL TAGS FOR LIVE SESSIONS!!** #Important
                        - E.g. #[[Live Session 2]]
                            - If this is official, a reminder for everyone to nest their notes underneath it for each session would be awesome.
                        - This is necessary for keeping the live session notes nested well among the many users.
                        - If everyone nested their notes from the live sessions under the official tag, then we could easily review the references for that page to explore other notes from the session. [[@Matthew McKinlay]]

                            - Right now there is too much tag diversity, causing a fragmentation of the session notes. #problem
                    - Questions tag?
                    - "→ #Chat [[Beau Haan 📌]] (Used to start a new chat by YOU)

→ #Reply [[My Name]] (Nested underneath, someone's `#Chat`)

→ #Question [[Their Name]] (This is for directing a question AT someone)

→ #Help [[My Name]] (If YOU need help)

→ #Announcement (this one might be important)

→ #@ [[Their Name]] (Used in conjunction with `#Chat` and `#Reply`?)

I'm sure there's more, but at least that would make the [[Daily Notes]] page a little more beautiful?"
