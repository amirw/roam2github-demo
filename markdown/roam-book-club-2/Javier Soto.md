    - **Process for taking notes**
Source: [[How to Take Smart Notes]] Loc 2.1
        - 1) **Thoughts** Write down everything that makes calls your attention, surprises you, makes you feel something, makes you pause and think.
            - Two different sources: 
                - 1) Out of the blue "fleeting notes"
                - 2) From a explicit source "literature notes". Add it to the note.
            - Never verbatim. Make it your own. 
            - Hemingway the hell out of it (summarize, strive for a perfect sentence)
        - 2) **Insights** The Slip Box
            - Everyday go through the Dump to review the notes
            - For each note
                - Think
                    - Be a maximalist (abstract and look at it from outside the box). 
                        - Can this be generalized, or is this just cool noise?
                        - Up to what altitude does it still make sense?
                    - Be a connector (to other insights). 
                        - What comes to mind?
                        - Have I seen this before? 
                        - Could this be applied to X? 
                        - Wouldn't it be cool if...?
                    - Be a contrarian. 
                        - Why doesn't this make sense? 
                        - How does it contradict what you already know?
                        - What happens if I deny it? 
                        - How, where and when doesn't this apply?
                        - Find counter examples. 
                        - Could it apply to A but no to B?
                    - Be a tinkerer. 
                        - What happens if I combine this with that?
                        - What happens if I combine this with anti-that?
                - Write it again
                    - In depth yet summarized. 
                    - Exploring to its final consequences. 
                    - Arguing and bringing it home.
                - Add links
                    - to the insights and notes it relates, supports, contradicts, or build upon
                    - to the overall themes, discussions, areas it associates
                    - to the index
            - 3) **Clear the Thoughts Cache** Prune the tree, clean the house, dampen the noise 
                - Eliminate the initial notes that have been assimilated.
                - Rinse and repeat
            - 4) **Ideas** Combine insights.
                - String insights into a narrative, go beyond and make something new. 
                - If Insights are atoms, Ideas are molecules.
