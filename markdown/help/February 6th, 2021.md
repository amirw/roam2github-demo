    - When you copy/paste a block, and a block which references it into a new database, it will create two new blocks -- which makes roam/render pretty easy to use.
        - Example::
            - {{roam/render: ((lzFJr9YCu))}}
                - ```clojure
(defn hello []
  [:button.bp3-button {:on-click #(js/alert "Hey Adam")} "Copy Paste this into your db"])```
        - This also works for templates
            - Sample calculation [[roam/templates]]
                - This will do multiplication
                    - A * B =  {{calc: ((DbOmtw4FP)) * ((Nisyw5VJW)) }}
                    - A is 4
                    - B is 5
            - 
            - This will do multiplication
                - A * B =  {{calc: ((eWcA2fLJO)) * ((as84zCZli)) }}
                - A is 6
                - B is 50

            - If I were trying to get a [[Roam Bounty]] for this, this weekend, without needing anything from the team - here is how I [[Conor]] would approach it.
                - Steps::
                    - {{[[TODO]]}} Decide how you are storing the contextual state -- I would do it with attributes most likely.
                        - I would probably use a dedicated attribute - where Entity is the Command - and the then the blocks in the sidebar are Values
                            - Example::
                                - #Work 
                                    - Loads Sidebar::
                                        - #scheduled
                                        - "{{[[mentions]]: [[Scheduling]]}}"
                                            - {{[[mentions]]: [[Scheduling]]}}
                                        - 
                                        - 
                                - #Personal 
                    - {{[[TODO]]}} write a roam/js function - which creates a click handler for a link or tag of the thing you have that loads a context
                    - {{[[TODO]]}} on-click simulate opening those blocks in the search field, and hitting shift-enter in order to open them in the sidebar.
